That was the decision .
This is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .
This is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund @-@ users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration .
I will conclude , Mr President , by saying that the failure of the Commission &apos; s communication to focus on territorial pacts and , especially , methods of combating unemployment among women and young people , is cause for serious concern .
I find the opposite the case .
This issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards EU credibility .
Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .
However I believe that we should use this opportunity for Europe to set down a marker for less red tape .
The competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .
The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval , through individual cases , which will take more than six or eight months to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility , affecting the generation of wealth and employment .
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace .
Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .
The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs .
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .
Mr President , we all want to do something about combating European fraud .
I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .
- The Schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of EU Structural Funds in Europe for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 .
Based as it is on such choices , it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union .
We await the outcome with great interest .
Secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .
We need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .
Where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation .
I think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .
The European Union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .
The next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the Commission .
It is essential that the Commission should have the benefit of Parliament &apos;s contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the European Union &apos;s food safety regime .
I realise that this is a somewhat time @-@ consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the Authority is - I believe - the way forward .
This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war .
For safety &apos; s sake , I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the Commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of Jacob Söderman &apos; s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable .
Thank you , Commissioner for your reply .
These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.50 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
At present , we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals , but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so .
Crucially , reforms must not be limited to the Commission .
We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair , which , as it happens , has still not been sorted out .
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies , it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised , on 14 September , to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February .
After all , the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms .
The need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the Commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the Commission does .
So I hope I can count on the understanding of the House on this occasion .
Nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the European Union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .
That would be a similar situation .
With this in mind I must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the French Presidency , with the aim of organising a Jumbo JHA @-@ ECOFIN Council .
Thirdly : the extension to Parliament &apos; s rights in this context .
We are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up .
But to bring it down to a more human level : to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs , and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation ; secondly , to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws ; thirdly , to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people ; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of &quot; normalisation &quot; and &quot; harm reduction &quot; and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people .
Does not the Council &apos; s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision @-@ making process ?
We have endeavoured to provide material help .
Please allow me to remark on how well @-@ versed and well @-@ informed he is on European affairs .
I consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .
For that reason , as Mr Karas also said , we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value .
The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries , and you see how we are today .
If you ratify this development , then you are ratifying the development of the Union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the Member States , and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a Union .
We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples , and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights .
I also appeal to the Austrian President , that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces .
We are extremely disappointed . As a last resort , we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives .
Mr President , Commissioner , regarding the relationship between science , on the one hand , and applying the precautionary principle on the other , the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence .
We must , of course , always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help .
It makes it impossible for those same Member States , at the IGC , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights .
The Finance Ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the Ecofin Council and in the Euro 11 Council , which is an unacceptable way to go on .
At the IGC , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution .
There will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal .
Perhaps this is also why , as is rumoured to be the case , the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well .
However , this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results , such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency &apos; s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competences of the Community Courts .
Finally , we have three questions for the Commission in this regard . Firstly , we need the Commission to give us , on a regular basis , the list and the amounts that other donors contribute .
I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight &apos; s debate .
However , it is important , at least in Finland , as a sustainably used , slowly renewable energy source .
We will support small and medium @-@ sized events , not the large ones , and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access . I believe that the fact that Culture and , fittingly , Education and Youth now fall within the same Commissioner &apos; s remit , will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes , which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the European Union .
The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years , and now , at long last , the European Parliament can give the go @-@ ahead .
We therefore consider that , in future , vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas .
For ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .
The car industry , increasingly more respectful of the environment , has , I am sure , anticipated this kind of increasing awareness .
There are certain weaknesses , the greatest of which , in my opinion , is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses ; after all , the car industry is more than just large companies .
We know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it , and there is no excuse for not taking action .
Madam President , I would simply like to point out that during the procedure , we were not allowed either to table or , consequently , adopt amendments in the Committee .
The directive remains in place .
The key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties .
- ( EL ) The Freedom Party &apos; s participation in the Austrian Government is a dangerous development for the European Union &apos; s political future .
Austria is a free , independent and sovereign country .
a ) Sittings from 14 to 18 February 2000 in Strasbourg Relating to Wednesday :
Since Mrs McCarthy &apos; s flight has been delayed slightly , I propose that we hear from Mr Decourrière first .
The Community initiative means community involvement . Some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents .
It is of decisive importance to get local business , organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes .
For me this raises the following questions : who will work there ?
I would , therefore , ask the Commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups .
Even though I approve of the general guidelines of INTERREG III , I feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme , financed by the ERDF , and the other external cooperation funds , including in particular the European Development Fund , intended for ACP countries .
Greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness , because the money should not be squandered recklessly .
He stressed a number of points , with which we may indicate our agreement , as many of you did too - the importance of this trans @-@ European cooperation , with its three strands , cross @-@ border , transnational , interregional ; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG , its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds , and the truly cross @-@ border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations ; the importance of common structures and what , in discussing another debate which begins today , the Intergovernmental Conference , I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen , and here , with INTERREG , thanks to INTERREG , is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity ; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners .
This would allow Member States great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs .
I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform , if it does not become more efficient , if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors , starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid .
We must preserve this law and peace in the European Union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world .
The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone .
We accept that Europeans , particularly the younger generation , need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead .
Is it not rather melodramatic to say that &quot; the world looks up to Europe &quot; ?
Tell the truth for once . You could not care less what the people of Europe want .
What is meant by the Commission &apos; s declared objective of &apos; economic reform &apos; in the labour market ?
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years .
We should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the European Union , for which the Commission is responsible .
Mr President , I wanted to point out an important matter of principle .
We know that some Member States are still wavering , for example , between rail and road for routes through vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees , as in the Aspe valley .
We do not think LEADER + will contribute substantively towards solving the countryside &apos; s problems , which are characterised by the decline of farming , which was and should remain the countryside &apos; s basic social and economic branch .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives .
I remind Parliament that in Article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health .
Do you envisage circumstances under which the BSE status will depend on the willingness to apply a BSE test ?
For despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection , when we look at the state of the environment in Europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved .
This is why it is so important that the European Parliament declares itself openly in favour of the OSPAR objective of close @-@ to @-@ zero by the year 2020 .
But we should not lower our standards too much either .
Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal .
Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well , that is to say via the television and Internet ?
I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that .
Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter ?
In 1988 , the Commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men .
The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community &apos; s action is , as you know , one of the essential elements of the new post @-@ Berlin Structural Funds Regulation .
I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints .
If we had considered these aspects in their overall context , then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden .
We share them with everyone on this earth .
Lastly , I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact .
These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found .
This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States , a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds .
But the reverse is also the case : a well @-@ developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth .
It is not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objectives .
If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment , flexibility and salary discipline , then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function , and vice versa .
We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created , where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large .
If we are to strengthen the European Union &apos; s role in international development policies , we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action .
The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments , procedures and institutional mechanisms .
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson , I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals , not only by Mr Nielson , but by the entire Commission , in order to make the policy coherent as a whole .
There are areas of coherence I would like to see as a member of the Committee on Development that would probably horrify some of the members of the Committee on Agriculture or Committee on Fisheries .
I welcome too the Council declaration of 1992 , its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the Treaty of European Union .
If these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance
The European Union &apos; s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999 : there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co @-@ sponsor a resolution on China , but an EU vote against the no @-@ action motion .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0015 / 2000 ) by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 70 / 524 / EEC concerning additives in feedingstuffs ( COM ( 1999 ) 388 - C5 @-@ 0134 / 1999 - 1999 / 0168 ( CNS ) )
Mr President , I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote , on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report .
In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue .
Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences .
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non @-@ EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum @-@ seekers , whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU .
Yet the most basic rules of conduct are being flouted on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Commissioner , economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union &apos; s status in the world .
Mr President , we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations .
The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status , even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus , for example , by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos , is clearly encouraging Turkey &apos; s intransigence .
It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7 , or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence , which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission .
Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed ?
Every day , new crimes come to light against non @-@ Albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of Kosovo , and there are hundreds of violations of the UN &apos; s Resolution 1244 .
Secondly , as there is no mention of Structural Funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ?
To summarise , perhaps what struck me most in your speech ; above all , you wished to remind us that , beyond its economic aspects , the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one .
The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction .
The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies .
As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje , there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , as regards the economy , movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi @-@ ethnic coexistence . On the other hand , the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high , both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe .
Let me emphasise that we can congratulate Macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30 % of ethnic Albanians in government activity , in government policy and in society , is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia .
We must thank them for playing this important role in moving towards peace , stability and democracy , at a very critical time last year , as I said , and at a strategically crucial point .
When it comes to the IGC , she is one of what the French call &quot; les pures et dures &quot; : no compromise , no deals with the other institutions ; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions .
Secondly , for economic and monetary union .
I also call on those few Member States still harbouring reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter , for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done .
That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use , a large amount ; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting .
It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments .
Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn .
By rejecting the rapporteur &apos; s Amendment No 39 , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council .
The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government .
On behalf of the TDI Group , I should like to take the opportunity afforded by Judge Di Pietro &apos; s report on mutual assistance in criminal matters to refer to a case which is a tragic illustration of the way crime is eroding security in Europe .
Mr Goebbels , I am sorry , but I think you are jumping the gun ; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words &apos; with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale &apos; be moved . You were asking for the place to be changed .

The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe , as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections .
And yet , under these difficult conditions , especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO , some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community .
In Italy , Commissioner Liikanen , Goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14 % of the market and which Goodyear itself defined as , &apos; having the most highly @-@ skilled workforce of all its plants &apos; , a plant which was opened with a total of EUR 85 million of European capital .
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation , adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States .
Having received a delegation from the Austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of Almería , it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred .
I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends . I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present , given his powers .
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy .
In terms of human rights , Europe has a very eventful past and this is why we have become to some extent the cradle of these human rights .
.
I have been informed that the Commissioner for the Environment , Margot Wallström , has travelled from Strasbourg to Romania in order to see for herself , on the spot , what has happened .
The Committee on Women &apos; s Rights paid particular attention to the issue of education , because according to official figures women account for 53 % of those engaged in tourism services , and in parallel , they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change .
Since then , however , there has been no progress .
We would like to thank the President of the Republic , as well as the Government and all the politicians who spoke and we too , in this House , would also call on the German Chancellor not to intervene in Italian internal affairs .
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism come Monday .
But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts , so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened .
Wrongly done , the threatening images that have been described here will certainly become a reality .
It is Commissioner Bolkestein &apos; s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year .
( The sitting was closed at 11.10 a.m. )
( Loud and sustained applause )
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years , and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon .
My question is this : there is a need for reform , due not least to the accession of new countries , and thus to the enlargement of the Union .
Madam President , I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide , the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months .
He is not always right , but in this case he is .
It concerns the next IGC .
At this stage , this could include , for example , collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee , the consolidation of Community responsibility for non @-@ military crisis management , the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence , coordination of the Treaty on European Union , the NATO Charter and the WEU , the legal personality of the European Union , reinforced cooperation in this area as well , parliamentary control and , lastly , financing .
We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year , but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with .
This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference .
Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under @-@ represented in peace @-@ keeping efforts , conflict resolution and reconstruction work .
Just before I say a word about the assistance which has been given by ECHO so far , perhaps I can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks .
Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said , the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking .
It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which , at 2 % , is now at its maximum permitted level .
We also agree about trying to further and benefit from this situation in order to improve conditions and about aiming for a definite improvement in employment .
We are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating injustice .
Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA .
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9 , but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join , at the same time , environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies .
However , I will just remind you that the meeting in Bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created .
Let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m. )
The second principle is the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle .
At the same time , we also have reason to believe that the Commission is failing to attend to one of its primary functions : guardianship of the Community Treaties .
Under the circumstances , when Israel does not clearly discharge its duty to apply the origin rules and the territorial clause of the agreement as it should , the Commission is encouraging Member States to resort to the import verification procedures which can be dilatory and evasive .
It is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the Commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results .
Even if we agree that a certain degree of tax harmonisation is necessary if the internal market is to function properly , Amendment No 4 is altogether too far @-@ reaching and undifferentiated when it comes to this issue .
Madam President , I do not think that Mrs Banotti should be cock @-@ a @-@ hoop today because she has laid on two Dutch TV channels .
We all recognise that the European Union , in spite of economic recovery , is still working well below par for too many people ; specifically for 15 million of our fellow citizens the EU is simply not working at all .
Between 1992 and 1998 , unemployment in Denmark fell to 5.1 % .
We must not build a Europe of the haves and the have @-@ nots .
If we consider our gross national product , that ought actually to be possible .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , do you know how Archimedes expounded his theory of the lever ?

Now then , we have to increase productivity in these areas sufficiently to sustain economic growth without inflation .
From this perspective we cannot fail to be satisfied .
One point which is of really fundamental importance to me is made in various amendments - for example , Amendments Nos 2 and 4 - which emphasise the active participation of forest peoples and the indigenous population .
Firstly , we wish to protect flora and fauna and secondly , there are a large number of coastlines along which , on the one hand , tourists enjoy themselves and on the other jobs are to be created .
The MARPOL Convention aims to prevent pollution from ships but legislation is clearly necessary to ensure the convention is enforced .
That is why , on the procedure , I should like to say once more that Amendment No 3 replaces Amendment No 2 which was adopted by the committee . It ought therefore to be put to the vote first tomorrow .
( The sitting was closed at 10.41 p.m. )
President Prodi , a friendly word of advice .
I am afraid that he misunderstood what I meant to say : I did not accuse the Portuguese Presidency or the Commission of lacking insight , but I did stress the fear of the future experienced by many of our fellow citizens in this radically changing world .
Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century .
Only 2 % outside the old Erasmus programme of students are actually mobile in Europe , which is not something upon which we can build a new economy at all .
Thank you very much , Mrs Thors .
Both consumers and small specialist chocolate @-@ makers would suffer a reduction in quality and standards would be reduced to the lowest level .
I think it is absolutely excellent that we should have different rules about chocolate in different Member States .
Mr President , I am Belgian and I am not opposed to the common position .
Although the breaches in the wreck had officially been sealed , oil slicks in fact continued to wash up on the shores , showing that either new leaks had appeared or that vessels passing through the vicinity were taking advantage of the situation to empty their tanks , or , probably , that both these things were occurring at the same time .
There is no reason for anyone to be afraid when the prevalence of rights over force is enshrined in the law .
This was not the purpose of today &apos; s discussion , but it is worth highlighting three points . Firstly , if we have put together such a unique body only to codify the existing law to the letter , then I believe it was not worth planning this new body .
The question which concerns us today , more than anything is : what should this charter contain and what legal force should it have ?
If it is to impact on the citizen it must appear in the Treaties of the European Union .
Mr President , the lawful object of the Charter of Rights is to protect the legitimate rights , expectations and aspirations of the citizen against the oppressive behaviour of government , business or other citizens ; and it is , of course , right that people should be thus safeguarded in respect of the European institutions and their activities .
Although the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled in 1996 that the Community could not sign the European Convention on Human Rights , I must emphasise that it made such a ruling because there was no legal basis in the Treaties for the Community to do so .
Just now , ladies and gentlemen , I expressed my concern in this document , and in the discussions we will be having , to avoid ideology , to keep to a precise approach .
But , in the final analysis , as we all know , what we need is the political will .
Furthermore , I was very pleased with Mr Lamy &apos; s reply - which was inevitable , given that Mr Lamy knows these issues very well - concerning the decentralisation of the information campaign .
Let me remind Mr Clegg , if necessary , that , in consideration of its service @-@ related aspects , the agreement on China &apos; s accession would in any case be subject , in principle , to the consultation procedure envisaged under Article 300 .
Instead , the question concerns countries outside the territory of the Community , and may be expressed thus : will we , or will we not , have the possibility of obtaining a derogation in terms of the tonnage , costs or time limits with regard to wood exports , in consideration of the quite exceptional nature of this storm ?
As the infrastructure is supposed to last for hundreds of years , it is essential to find the best solution .
I am totally convinced that , wherever there are well @-@ functioning eco @-@ labelling systems , it will be possible also to introduce the EU flower that much more easily and more quickly .
In addition , we also need to avoid a situation where it becomes clear there are long @-@ term health risks for a reason which may not be immediately obvious , namely that the emission of harmful substances is not measured .
Regrettably , our consumer society is contributing to an increasing volume of domestic waste and there is also growing concern in relation to industrial waste .
Mr President , honourable Members , efforts to set limits for pollutants produced by waste incineration and to introduce specific control procedures are indeed a positive step .
This is also justified from the point of view of cost @-@ income analysis .
During the short time I have in which to speak , I should like to try to scotch some of the flourishing myths which exist with regard to the ozone issue .
Examining the proposal and the argumentation - as I assume other Members have done - I notice that , at the time when the European ceilings were being stipulated , the UN protocol was still being negotiated .
Acidification occurs due to acid rain , caused by air polluting emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels .
Finally , I should like to answer Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten because she asked about the proposals on large combustion plants .
Contrary to the suggestion in one of the oral questions , this does not represent a new obligation on the Member States .
If you are saying that Member States are contravening Community law , breaching Community law , then bring these Member States to justice !
Mr President , the European Union , which advocates and practises a set of values which we are proud to say is at the forefront of the international community , has been emphasising the vital importance of observing the Geneva Conventions .
Mr President , the symbol of the Red Cross / Red Crescent movement brings hope to battlefields worldwide .
Thank you very much , Mr Nielson .
The second theme emphasised in my report is to positively welcome diversity as a source of social vitality , economic prosperity and international influence .
A powerful and concerted effort is needed from all Member States to fight this outrageous form of trafficking in human beings .
Mr President , in this great debate about human rights it is surprising how infrequently we hear children mentioned - the people who are least able to protect themselves in relation to human rights .
It is not by chance that the Declaration of Human Rights coincided in France with the affirmation of national sovereignty .
My Group did not have any reason to table any more amendments .
Neither represent any conceivable threat to the Italian State .
Should the EPP amendments to this report be adopted we will oppose the whole report .
In place of the word &apos; exceeded &apos; it says &apos; reached &apos; , which is the opposite .
In this case , although it is indisputable that Member States using vegetable fats instead of cocoa butter should be entitled to market their products , the question is whether these can be legitimately marketed under the name &apos; chocolate &apos; .
Will the new text at least allow the consumer to easily distinguish between true and imitation chocolate ?
Accordingly , although I would have liked to go further with restrictions on incineration and co @-@ incineration processes , I am nevertheless delighted with what has been achieved , given that this directive :
Myller report ( A5 @-@ 0063 / 2000 )
While I strongly support China &apos;s admission to the WTO , we should give China a dose of its own medicine .
Many Roma in the candidate Member States live in extremely abject conditions .
As the Portuguese Presidency , that is the Portuguese Prime Minister , acted as a channel for the position that 14 countries of the European Union expressed as regards their bilateral relations with Austria , I would like to be very clear about the following point : we do not have any criticism to make about how Austria has behaved at international level , and in particular about how Austria has fulfilled its duties and obligations within the European Union .
We will persevere with such measures .
It is vital for the Commission that the Parliament contributes to the growing momentum surrounding these proposals by delivering its opinions on the package as soon as possible , and by participating fully in the work of drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy .
We take the view that these two separate submissions are unnecessary and we have tabled a single proposed amendment which I shall read to you .
I regret that I cannot accept your new amendment which replaces Article 17 and 17a by a single new article comprising the entire comitology procedure .
In 1997 , the Ministerial Conference in The Hague resulted in The Hague Ministerial declaration on a European Code of Conduct to prevent and combat trafficking in women for the purpose of sexual exploitation .
Different individuals will have different perceptions of all this .
Of course , the Greek Governments bear some responsibility , but at some point all this needs to be analysed .
But my actual question concerns the fact that the President of the European Commission , Mr Prodi , has sent a letter to the European Parliament criticising the Parliamentary Ombudsman , Jacob Söderman , for having taken part in a public debate and wanting various documents to be widely accessible , as well as having presented his own point of view that there should be more public access to documents in the EU .
We know from the WTO that environmental laws are regularly sidelined as the result of such disputes .
When I was a young child , a library was opened in a village where I was born and brought up ; when the head teacher of the village school opened the library , he said that there were over 4 000 books in the library , and I thought with all the wisdom of a six @-@ year old child : well , that is all the books in the world .
I am glad that this point is made in the report .
That means it is lagging behind the United States which , indeed , no one would deny .
With many companies in the same position , or almost the same position , there is going to be a bubble effect in the industry , and when the crash comes I hope the taxpayer will not be footing the bill .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , this is only the fourth point of order I have raised in nearly eleven years as an MEP , so I hope you will listen .
It is a gift to large @-@ scale European industry .
To that end , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs calls on the Council to put the Charter on the ICG agenda .
Yet the Commission , ever faithful to its nature and its habits , cannot stop taking every opportunity to overwhelm the states and their citizens with new directives and pernickety little rules , which often bear little relation to real local conditions .
I would , however , add a few caveats .
How many of them have been forced to devote more time to their professional life than they would have wished ?
As I understand it , Portugal does not intend , during its presidency , to take any initiatives on this issue .
Mr Van den Bos has also pointed this out .
Mr President , as a member of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and also as a Member of the European Parliament from the Basque Country , a land which has supplied a fair number of emigrants to Latin American countries , I want to express my solidarity with all those who fight for human rights to be upheld - not only in Peru , but throughout the world . And I want to denounce the situation that exists in Peru , a situation which is due not just to the complacency and connivance of the United States , as has been mentioned here , but also to that of plenty of other countries , including European ones , and the hypocrisy which reigns over international politics .
The campaign has started and anyone who disagrees with him needs to keep their mouths shut .
She says : &apos; How can you expect me to condemn human rights abuses in Algeria , China and elsewhere when the United Nations themselves are responsible for the situation in Iraq ? &apos;
But let us be clear - the key to the lifting of sanctions lies with the Iraqis .
B5 @-@ 0243 / 2000 by Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen and Mr Bowis , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) ;
I would stress that this is the second time that the adoption of this motion has been deferred and I hope that events do not reach crisis level before we are able to attempt to influence the situation to bring about peace .
- ( DA ) We are in favour of the humanitarian angle from which the report has been drawn up .
The ECB must , at the very least , be financially independent .
Yet it is a revealing slip of the pen .
We hope that this amendment will be adopted .
Chickpeas and lentils are two essential products in Spanish gastronomic culture and in our diet , the Mediterranean diet , which is now so highly thought of by scientists , which includes dried pulses in our traditional recipes .
One is the shock news of BMW &apos;s decision to break up the Rover @-@ Land Rover Group with the threat of massive redundancies right the way across the UK and the other breaking news this morning is the Conservative Party &apos;s stunning victory in the Ayr by @-@ election driving the defending Labour Party into a miserable third place with a swing of almost 10 % .
So there are lessons to be learned : set against the staff the Commission had at its disposal to deal with the Irish problem - three or four people - Ireland had 30 000 civil servants , and the Irish Civil Service won every time !
Statement by the President
Two examples of that would be hair @-@ dryers in a hair salon or equipment in a gym centre .
The Commission &apos; s services have worked on a proposal to introduce these tests in BSE monitoring throughout the Community since September last year .
We can understand that American politicians have little room for manoeuvre .
It was my impression at this meeting , that in common with ourselves , Mr Slater is of the opinion that the hushkits are an issue of secondary importance which stands in the way of far more important issues , and that we must put this matter to bed as swiftly as possible .
Only under these circumstances could we accept a delay in our regulation for third countries .
Economic cooperation must include multilateral / bilateral approaches facilitating the promotion of trade among Mediterranean countries and south @-@ south trade .
In this respect , we should point out the difficulties involved in launching the MEDA programmes , the excesses of centralisation , the heterogeneous nature of aid criteria , the lack of joint reflection on the possibility of a common Mediterranean agricultural policy and , thirdly , and as a consequence the tiny amount of direct investment in the south : just 2 % of the total of the European Union &apos; s direct foreign investments .
Secondly , in my opinion , there is a lack of generosity .
Information campaigns must be undertaken in close cooperation with the countries of origin and of transit , publicising the real opportunities for legal emigration , in an attempt to reduce or eliminate the problem at its source .
My colleague , Anna Terrón , has said that this report is naïve .
I have the very real impression that when the round of finance ministers hears the words &apos; review of the interinstitutional agreement &apos; , it immediately thinks of wasted money and sees red .
I wish them both luck in the task facing them .
Farmers and cooperatives expect the European Commission to reduce the amount of red tape in the agricultural economy and adopt budgetary guidelines based on calculation , reliability and progressive structures .
I should like in particular to thank the two rapporteurs on behalf of the Commission .
Children as persons with their own , inviolable rights deserve our special protection , irrespective of the country in which they live .
The development of child sex tourism flies in the face of the very idea of a human community united on the basis of ideals such as respect and dignity , and public welfare and remembrance .
I want to pick up the point made by my colleague Mr Wuermeling that we must take particular care about development risks in the environment within which we now find ourselves .
Mr President , I too should like to thank Mr Turmes on behalf of my Group for the excellent and detailed work contained in his report .
I am sure that this was an oversight in the drafting of the text .
I remember that too .
No , the time for investigations and debate is past . Now , we must act .
But with &apos; Echelon &apos; , we find that Boeing belongs to a specific nation , Rayton belongs to a specific nation , and they are having people spy on Airbus or Thomson because those companies do not belong to the same nation .
But the Office assures me that proceedings will speedily lead to conclusions , subject to respecting the rights of the parties to be heard .
It seems to me that that is all we need to do , provided , of course , that the directive is properly applied .
It is imperative that new priorities are given new financial resources .
The only reason we are not voting against this text is that we refuse to be associated with the extreme right and their despicable ranting .
Turmes report ( A5 @-@ 0078 / 2000 )
Science itself seems outpaced by the onward rush of sorcerer &apos; s apprentices with no longer any taboos , moral boundaries or ethics .
The Group leaders have heard your points .

In fact , the Netherlands was the first country to set up such a contact point back in 1996 , on the initiative of the Internet providers .
Our children should be protected against this disrespectful exploitation , which reduces them to mere toys and leaves them damaged for the rest of their lives .
I therefore appeal that the target which the Committee has set itself , i.e. of establishing the age of 18 as standard at European level , be implemented as soon as possible .
We should really spell this out a little more clearly .
We must also deal with the actual money to be allocated , which must be in proportion to the stated objectives .
I think that electronic money will gain in importance , not just in commerce but also for consumers , particularly as the safety precautions on the Internet are regarded as inadequate and many are therefore hesitant to choose this option .
It is now more than 20 years , for example , since the discovery of the presence of female sex hormones in jars of baby food led directly to the hormone directives being issued in 1981 and 1985 and revised in 1988 .
The Council does not appear to see that , after the dioxin crisis , every day since the start of the year there have been cases of mad cows just about everywhere in Europe .
All other amendments tabled by this committee receive our support , including the amendment tabled by the PSE Group .
He and I sometimes cross swords on the issue of other nutritious additives , but in this case we are looking very much at the essence of the burden of proof before this list is yet further extended .
Next , there is one other aspect which has not been taken into account , to wit , the potential interaction between the many additives found in food .
Unfortunately , I was forced to include another postponement in my report , this time in relation to the Economic and Social Committee .
What I find extraordinary is that EUR 2 billion are being managed by this vestige - the last remainder of the European Coal and Steel Community , which , of course , was very important historically but is not important any more .
These are not just empty words as far as the Commission is concerned , which is why I have transferred all the confidential audit reports needed to the Committee on Budgetary Control , or rather to the rapporteur , during the course of the discharge procedure and which is why the Commission has also replied in detail to questionnaires , even though this differed from past reporting practice .
Using the pressure of postponement to advance discharge is constructive pressure because it gives the Commission the chance to clear up shortcomings caused by slowness , pettifogging or unwillingness so that Parliament will be able to grant discharge for 1998 as quickly as possible , hopefully before the summer recess .
This too we see as an important chance for Parliament to restore confidence and make it clear that it takes its own administration and the shortcomings in its own administration seriously .
I have a few comments on Mr Kuhne &apos; s and Mrs Stauner &apos; s reports .
Well , Mr Kuhne , I can assure you that this is not the case .
The Commission &apos; s delegations have failed .
Mrs Stauner &apos; s motion for a resolution , which was before us initially was , in this respect , unbalanced . It over @-@ simplified the issue and its sole aim appeared to be to malign the new Commission .
All four of them must look carefully at their past , come clean and show this new Commission where reform is needed .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work on the proposal for the directive amending Directive 95 / 2 / EC .
As is often the case , this allocation is inadequate to handle the actual requirements .
There are major advantages in a form of coordination based upon benchmarking , but we should of course be careful that the whole process does not take a bureaucratic turn or lead to over @-@ zealous management .
To call it the Employment Summit , however , would be to depart from its real purpose .
It is debatable just how much of ECOFIN &apos; s die @-@ hard approach was totally justified , but perhaps we are now in a position to leave this behind us .
First of all , Mr Blair . He makes enough noise but is destroying the British industry by setting the exchange rate for the pound far too high .
Some progress was made on this issue too .
Mr President , first of all I would like to emphasise that I consider the fact that this summit has been held to be extremely positive .
While it is nice to recall the EU &apos; s important decision to grant duty @-@ free access for essentially all products , it would have been even more significant to have gone beyond the famous &quot; essentially all &quot; to include those products of real importance to the poorest countries , such as agricultural goods .
Such a step is significant .
If we look at total official development assistance , globally it has in fact decreased .
Could you explain whether you will use this American model as a gauge , because I think this is an excellent example of how things could be done and how they could be done properly ?
For example , you can distinguish very well between the humanitarian assistance which ECHO has given in Serbia and the assistance we have given through the Energy through Democracy programme .
This severely restricts the ability of families with dialysis @-@ dependent members to travel .
( PT ) Mr President , the Commission is perfectly aware , as it demonstrated exhaustively in the two communications it transmitted to the European Parliament on this matter , the first in November 1997 and the second in December 1998 , of the need for coordinated and multidisciplinary action at European level , for both preventing and combating trafficking in women .
Of course benchmarking means that no more than 60 days should lapse and , as I said , more and more payments are being settled within this period .
There had been no meeting of the Association Council between Turkey and the Union for three years and nor had there been any meeting of this kind after the deliberations and the criteria laid down in Helsinki .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , whoever wants to join the EU must meet the Copenhagen criteria and abolish the death penalty .
What Ecevit said to us was that there were several Kurdish dialects and that he could even imagine Kurdish being used as an official language in Turkey under certain conditions .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur , David Bowe , for his hard work .
I believe there are four areas where we must act to reassure the public .
We must address those very real issues .
It is true that there is no specific Community legislation for the contained use of genetically modified plants and animals .
What everybody wants - whether they are farmers , citizens or consumers in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the Union - is to feel that they have equal confidence , wherever they are , in the safety of the product that they are consuming .
That is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass .
Let us make no mistake as to what is at issue here .
Proposed Amendment No 48 refers to information on the use of antibiotics or stimulants and to fattening methods .
Madam President , I think Mr Ribeiro e Castro is quite right to consider the Dimitrakopoulos @-@ Leinen report inadmissible because it conflicts with and even infringes a number of rights enshrined in our institutions .
The second major point is the Union &apos; s legal personality . It has been formulated here as if it were only related to foreign policy but it also has enormous significance for internal policy .
It plays a secondary role , as do all those who are not part of a national government .
This is a key issue for the citizens of Europe .
I would be keen to hear the Council &apos; s and Commission &apos; s opinion on this .
In fact he believes that the wording of Amendment No 11 is such as to suggest a different voting order from the one you recommend .
So we can only regret that those amendments that went much further , that indeed allowed us to anticipate the implications of GMOs for nature , were not accepted .
We must not put our people or our animals at unnecessary risk .
The only thing in the Lisbon conclusions one could agree with is that &apos; people are Europe &apos; s main asset &apos; , except for the fact that they are not disposed to be &apos; liquidated &apos; in the international money markets and to sacrifice themselves so that the monopolies can inflate their profits .
Two thirds of the vote is the majority required for our Parliament to censure the Commission .
That is the challenge we have to meet at a moment when many of our fellow @-@ citizens are beginning to feel doubts and see few political prospects .
This document contains other incongruities too , especially in relation to the budget , which fortunately have no chance of success in the Council and even less chance of being ratified by national parliaments that have any self @-@ respect .
The decisions were also taken at the right time .
We all witnessed the fight against hunger ten years ago .
Thank you very much Minister .
We are sure that in future meetings of the General Affairs Council this issue will be followed with close attention and by effective steps towards its realisation .
I would include this among the priorities I mentioned before , because investments will also be affected if this level of organised crime is maintained .
An Association Council meeting was held yesterday between the European Union and Turkey in which this issue was mentioned again . The Turkish authorities were told of the EU &apos; s concern about this type of issue and of its hope that the Turkish authorities will end what is currently interpreted as a non @-@ compliance with certain basic criteria of respect for human and democratic rights and the protection of minorities .
The Council has been consistently supporting the efforts made by UNMIK and KFOR to prevent further expulsions and to allow the safe return of all those who abandoned their homes .
That is where the problem lies and that is what we should all realise , as European citizens and people interested in developments in the Balkans .
To be totally frank and at the risk of being considered behind the times , I do believe that there are limits to what can be achieved by pro @-@ active political action in this area .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.00 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
My firm opinion is that all the different pension schemes should be covered by the same directive in order not to protect certain types of schemes from competition .
The set pension fund strategy essentially aims to drain savings away toward the financial markets .
The governments have squandered the funds and made off with the workers &apos; salaries .
It would , in my view , be incorrect - and the European Union would impose artificial restrictions on itself - if the Commission were to restrict the directive to be proposed to pension schemes which only cover biometric risks and if it were to exclude other pension provisions which , although they are full pension provisions because they cannot be collected before pensionable age , should nonetheless still be excluded from the directive , according to a number of delegates .
I want to focus on a couple of the principal points that she makes .
I like this metaphor because it is true that European citizens have the feeling that this internal market is already in place . They take it for granted and do not give it any further thought .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m .
In order for the accounting methods of the different Member States to be homogenous , as the rapporteur has pointed out , they must use the same criteria .
Mr President , we all want to see the end of the &apos; banana war &apos; , but the immense complexity of the problem deceives no one .
We are divided from our German friends .
We must now come to an arrangement as quickly as possible that complies with the rulings of the WTO , with the promises made to the ACP countries and which is in the interests of our producers and consumers .
The Commission firmly believes that your wish to replace the tariff system with a permanent tariff quota system will only lead to renewed attacks in the WTO .
This is about calling on the administration to present an action plan by 15 May describing exactly how improvements can be made .
But the political question remains - is this the moment and is this the issue for an apparent public stand off between Parliament and the Prodi Commission ?
To my mind , the fact that so many amendments were tabled is a sign that there had been a failure to reach sufficient agreement beforehand , and the fact that not even the compromise amendments were adopted is a sign that we were not yet ready to vote on this in plenary .
Should a system with a single European constituency be introduced , the number of Members should not be increased .
The debate which has begun between Member States is reflected in the points of view expressed within the European Parliament , as is the tension over the scope of the IGC .
Mr President , during these last few days , Parliament has been watching an extraordinarily powerful documentary on the effects of the sanctions on Iraq , and I would like to thank Patricia McKenna for this .
In this regard , we agree with the draft resolution .
That is what we should condemn .
The youngest is only sixteen years old .
Now that the country has acquired candidate country status , we see opportunities for democracy and freedom in our country .
You may well feel that it is strange to sit in a near half @-@ empty chamber , apart from the visitors , and discuss such an important subject , but I think it is a subject which we must continue to take up , and I would ask the Member States to also respond to it here , to respond swiftly and in no uncertain terms to this so @-@ called friendly state which repeatedly violates the most basic human rights .
Land reform is one of the most important issues throughout southern Africa , so it is therefore not surprising to see that it is again being exploited by Mugabe to his advantage , just prior to the elections , exactly as he has done in previous elections .
As we speak there are 125 million children in the world who do not go to school .
After a very long period of supremacy by the party in government up to that point - a period lasting over 50 years - the political scene has been revitalised .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
In the frame of this European Year , most of the amendments aim to establish closer cooperation with the Member States at all levels of policy , not only at national level but also at regional and even local policy level .
.
We must be logical and adopt the right use of power and the right course to do our job as well and as consistently as possible .
The United States , which is famous for having a more individualist outlook with less solidarity , spends nearly 9 000 million dollars a year on distributing foods to schoolchildren , i.e. 100 times more than the European Union .
Mr President , for years I have been calling for the school milk scheme to be changed .
It is important to define unambiguously the relevant markets referred to in Article 3 of the Block Exemption regulation .
( Applause )
Moreover , let me tell you quite explicitly that I have taken careful note of the problems which exist .
In these proceedings it is vital that the interested parties are fully informed by the Commission , but the practice fails to honour that ideal .
This is probably the first time I have heard delegates referred to as soldiers , but we know what role we are playing here .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the airline industry has become a growing as well as a thriving industry within the Union .
Different airports are already working on this by issuing flight bans to the noisiest aircraft or by banning certain night flights .
Mr Lannoye , I understand that you are moving that the vote be adjourned .
In effect , timber is not among the products listed in Annex I of the Treaty . There is no legal framework and timber cannot therefore be governed by a specific market policy , even temporarily .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is now some three months since Hurricane Lothar caused devastating damage to forests in Europe , and in particular France and Baden @-@ Württemberg .
Matters proceeded as was established .
However , since the beginning of April , we have witnessed a situation involving a hunger strike begun by a journalist , Mr Ben Brik , which is causing a serious crisis of conscience and a violation of the association agreement by the Tunisian Government . It has not only forbidden Ben Brik from writing as correspondent for the French newspaper La Croix , but it has also taken away his passport and prevented him from using the telephone .
The necessary redeployment is the result mainly of comparable cuts in the TACIS programme for the countries of the former Soviet Union .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
That is why we do not yet have any additional mode of transport , why no fewer cars are being driven and why we are not seeing a switch to rail transport .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , first let me very firmly reject Mrs Schroedter &apos; s across @-@ the @-@ board criticism of the TENs .
The participation of private capital will necessarily result in a quest for profit , to the detriment both of users and of those who work in the sector .
Thank you , Commissioner de Palacio .
We support the development of a European aviation space encompassing all aspects of aviation , ranging from delays to environmental harm .
This report should also accommodate the downside of a worldwide aviation market .
In addition , the government should invest more in measures which improve the quality of life of those living near airports .
In summary therefore , a total of 25 promotions to senior appointments have been made since this Commission took office . Six of the officials are Italian nationals , five are German , five are British , three Belgian , two Irish , one Dutch , one French , one Austrian and one Spanish .
I also welcome the fact that , based on your information , it appears that there are no major imbalances . I feel this should be acknowledged .
Having such rules would obviously be the best means of ensuring transparency , consistency and practical guidance which would be in the interests of all parties , especially when , as Members have reminded us in the course of the debate , Member States and institutions are increasingly keen to encourage more exchange between national and EU administrations and between the public and private sectors .
It is , of course , global .
Mr President , with the adoption , without amendments , of the common position of the Council , the European Parliament is rising to the challenges of the current changes , to the demands of the new economy , at last setting rules in place governing the use of the Internet for trade and the provision of services .
So I would ask for it to be made clear that the directive does not apply to the fixed book price schemes introduced via legislation or arrangement in some Member States .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I want to sincerely thank all those who helped me draft this report , and especially the committee members for adopting it unanimously .
Mr President , I strongly support Mrs Schierhuber &apos; s report on food aid .
The central thrust of my report is to help the people in war @-@ torn areas , in ravaged parts of the world , to settle back to normality , to have proper foundations and sanitation , proper infrastructure , and to stop them needing to travel as asylum seekers and refugees .
The Commission started preparations for the renewal of this regulation in Spring 1999 .
At the end of the 1980s , a plan was drafted in the European Commission whereby the then European Community would consolidate as a federation and the other countries of Europe would join the Single Market via the European Economic Area arrangements .
This , however , is not enough .
Moldova is a country where the community , or society , has abdicated responsibility in a number of areas .
And in order to do so , Parliament must agree to remove the veil of doctrine which blurs the vision of the great majority of its Members when it comes to incontrovertible evidence of the need to re @-@ establish internal border controls within the Community .
For this reason , I would like to congratulate him on his splendid work .
Let us remember that if the European Commission decided to support them , any new bodies which might be set up by the international community would be guaranteed funding from the first pillar budget , without any need to even consider consulting the European Parliament .
The terrorists intended to strike a blow at one of the most precious assets of democracy , freedom of expression .
I was simply making a protest about the electronics here . I was unable to receive interpretation , and I am sure that certain other Members were having difficulty with interpretation earlier .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , when our farmers read in the press that we in the European Parliament are debating agricultural prices for the 2000 / 2001 financial year , many will certainly cherish the hope that we might just be considering a few price increases .
Does this fit in with the Commission &apos; s plans ?
We will commission a study of this kind .
The importance of flax production being subsidised in such areas of the European Union cannot be overemphasised .
If you say that you cannot accept them , we will react tomorrow and then we will have to negotiate this sound proposal from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development at another level .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Fischler .
On the contrary , we should at least maintain and , where possible , increase these contributions , if only as a token gesture , although we share the concern with regard to the available resources .
There is so much there which so few have enjoyed .
This is unethical .
We should not be bounced into a decision because the Council deems it to be necessary .
Our main priority has to be to explain to European citizens what we are doing , why we are doing it and how we are doing it .
This paragraph does Parliament no credit .
Having said that , the Ferber report has tried to balance the needs of Parliament coming into a new millennium - new needs , enlargement on the horizon - and to make it function effectively .
The European Union acquired a new remit following the war in Kosovo and the resolutions on the Stability Pact in the Balkans .
The next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 0116 / 2000 ) by Mr Bösch , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the 1998 annual report by the European Commission on protecting the Communities &apos; financial interests and the fight against fraud .
Consequently , it is not just within the Commission that we need to wield an instrument to fight fraud , which we call OLAF .
If it can always be seen who has obtained what , fraud will be revealed by journalists and a critical public - perfectly free of charge and with far greater preventative effect .
Mr President , I have to depart a little bit from what I intended to say .
Article 280 of the Amsterdam Treaty also makes this clear .
This legislation governing the issue of civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles and accidents in Europe will ensure that the rights of the 370 million consumers in Europe will be enhanced in the case of accidents taking place within any of the territories of the European Union .
There are , however , a few sticking points .
I would remind those present that , with our additional safety measures , we in the UK are only exporting to the Community de @-@ boned carcasses which have gone through maximum checks and security .
That is the main lesson to be learnt from the TSE business .
Mr Whitehead said quite clearly that safety must be a priority , but he would , of course , like the precautionary principle to be applied in equal measure in other Member States and that is the main point here .
I wish to begin by thanking you for the excellent cooperation between your assistants and my services .
Exemptions are only possible under a collective labour agreement or following consultation involving both sides of industry .
I assure you that it does change with the next speaker .
Lastly , I would like to ask the Commissioner and the Commission , to monitor closely the application of the directive , so that in nine years time they do not ask for three more .
We are not proud of the result in terms of the content .
The role is to make sure that the formulation of the different programmes , including those in DG RELEX , is consistent with the policy and principles that we have defined .
She was charged with providing secret information to foreigners and is believed to have been sentenced to eight years &apos; imprisonment at a secret trial .
The study will also take into account the need to draw up an olive oil quality strategy in order to add more value to the product .
As well as a significant and lasting increase in the levels of employment , one of the key priorities of the employment strategy is to improve the quality of jobs .
There is not a single country involved in the process which takes the view that we should depart from this objective of full membership .
The time @-@ limits for the Commission to take a decision on aid projects notified by a Member State are laid down in Council Regulation 659 / 1999 .
It also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data .
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank all the Members who supported the rapporteur in his work in presenting these two reports which are , I believe , absolutely crucial to the future of the railways .
I would urge you to look into the positive experiences which certain countries have had in changing the labour organisation of the rail system , in order to bring about a more efficient rail system and to set up exchange programmes , so that we can learn from experiences in countries which have struggled in the past , and which are often still struggling where other elements of the rail dossier are concerned , such as liberalisation or fair pricing .
I would urge you to support the amendments to this effect .
This means that it should not be regulated by means of the so @-@ called &apos; specific cases &apos; , subject to committee decisions , but that , on the contrary , we should consider the possibility that automatic derogations should apply depending on the incompatibility of these technical specifications with existing lines .
As a result , a lot of things work well within our countries . However , the deficiencies become apparent as soon as it is a question of crossing a border .
The next item is the oral question ( B5 @-@ 0223 / 2000 ) by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , to the Commission , on the installation of the MOX demonstration facility at the British Nuclear Fuels site at Sellafield .
I welcome the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association WENRA which was formed just over a year ago in February 1999 .
It is , generally speaking , more comfortable to leave that out , but this is a matter of extreme concern to the Irish Government , the Irish people and happily , also to the Danish Government .
Documents were taken away , the telephones were cut off and threats of legal action remain .
It would almost be like the United Nations issuing a currency .
That is a structural reform we must drive through .
Lastly , I would like to point out that something has been raised which may seem contradictory between those who argue for greater coordination of economic policies and those who argue for greater subsidiarity in the way these policies are applied .
At the beginning of the 1990s , Greece was considered the sick man of Europe , economically speaking .
Every self @-@ respecting economist knows that Greece , despite the impressive achievements of the past couple of years , does not yet have inflation and government debt sufficiently under control or in order .
Perhaps Mrs Buitenweg can give us her opinion , as rapporteur ?
After the directive enters into force , the Member States have a total of nine years before they are obliged to have transposed the directive into national legislation .
The objective is a threefold one : to gradually create the conditions for the uninterrupted movement of trains on the 15 national networks - the free movement objective ; to eliminate current high costs and delays in order to improve the competitiveness and reliability of the railways vis @-@ à @-@ vis their competitors - the sustainable mobility objective ; and to create the conditions for a single European market in railway rolling stock by harmonising the elements that make up the railways - the economic and technological objective .
I would like to talk about some of the points which have been mentioned today , given the concern about the Greek model .
This leads me to reiterate the hope that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will propose subjecting all legislation on competition policy to the codecision procedure , thereby enabling us legally to work on a more equal footing .
Instead , they must put forward a broad and resolute plan that will make a decisive contribution to ending a situation of this kind and help to put the development of such important parts of the world into perspective .
Resolution of the debt issue must be accompanied by actions promoting local development .
We therefore strongly urge all Member States and the Commission to support the international financial institutions &apos; HIPC initiative for highly indebted poor countries .
Following the EU Member States &apos; agreement in the Azores on 6 and 7 May , the Commission this week has a mission in Zimbabwe to look at necessary arrangements for an EU observer team and to coordinate with other election observation initiatives by SADC , the Commonwealth and the US .
Mr Mugabe has lost control of the country , presiding over lawlessness and corruption .
My question is therefore as follows : in the context of negotiations with a view to Turkey &apos; s accession to the European Union , has the issue of this blockade been raised , and could lifting this blockade be counted a precondition to Turkey &apos; s accession ?
They come from the specific EDF budget , which is why I say that it would be rather difficult to transfer EDF appropriations to aid for Kosovo , because they are not part of the Community budget .
However , subsequent regulatory development and the initiatives being proposed are incomplete and unbalanced .
A5 @-@ 0122 / 2000 by Mr Alyssandrakis , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , on the communication from the Commission to the European Parliament , the Council , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions : Next Steps in Radio Spectrum Policy - Results of the Public Consultation on the Green Paper ( COM ( 1999 ) 538 - C5 @-@ 0113 / 2000 - 2000 / 2073 ( COS ) ) .
Furthermore , we ask that , as soon as possible , flat rates be established for access to the Internet , to the network of networks , and we even argue that they should be free , since they should be offered , like health and education , as an essential public service to the citizens .
The main political issue in the entire discussion concerned the development of a coherent approach to space and the promotion of collaboration between the European Union and the ESA on the basis of specific targets and within a clear framework .
Mr President , I have to say with great regret that I disagree with my colleague , Mrs Plooij @-@ Van Gorsel , on one point , namely this : if there is any end worth pursuing in human life it is knowledge for knowledge &apos; s own sake .
According to the figures made available by the Commission , Europe is definitely lagging behind the United States .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Busquin for deciding and having the courage to create a European research area , bearing in mind that , in the field of knowledge , we have always fought hard for the principle of solidarity .
It obviously comprises the traditional themes , which is quite normal because , although the world moves on , these themes are still on the agenda . Admittedly , there are new emphases but , at the end of the day , they are the same recurring themes .
Unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , we must assume that the new era is bringing with it not only electronic commerce , as defined in the economy , but also electronic commerce in women and children .
Such an event would demand common action , without wavering or compromise .
I would ask Parliament to express its view , and I do so with all due respect for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the internal Market , which has held a full debate on this issue , because I believe that there are two basic elements here .
Madam President , you can consult any other internal body and , in particular ...
We have reached an impasse . I fully understand that you want Mr Le Pen to lose his mandate .
By way of preparing for the report , the Committee on Women &apos; s Rights and Equal Opportunities organised a public hearing which involved experts and the presence of a victim who came to give her story .
At the end of the day , the fight against the trafficking in human beings , as well as being essential to the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice , is an unavoidable ethical duty .
We shall now proceed to the votes .
You have indicated that we will start with the Buitenweg report at 3.00 p.m. and that we will vote at 6.00 p.m .
We are now suffering from an example of this centralisation at the hands of certain Green Members , who prevented a number of important votes on the Friday of the April Strasbourg part @-@ session , because the quorum of one third of the Members present was not established .
- ( EL ) The European Parliament is being called upon today to give its opinion on the adoption by Greece of the single currency , now that the Commission and the European Central Bank have given the go @-@ ahead .
We need a modern public telecommunications service which embraces technical and scientific progress .
However , we believe that , in the context of this debate , the absolute priority must be to provide education .
The second amendment , which is important , is the amendment on incitement to racial discrimination which is as important as the act of racism itself , and I hope the Commission will take it on board .
My Group agrees that since the employer authority has most of the information , it must prove there has been no breach of equal treatment once the complainant has demonstrated a case .
I also agree with your proposal to define the role of the European Monitoring Centre - as contained in Amendment No 59 - although I should point out that our experience at the Commission tells us that the submission of reports by Member States every two years is a particularly demanding task and will not enable us to correctly assess the impact of the policies developed .
It is not difficult to imagine why they then withdraw to their estates and districts where they end up getting together with other socially excluded or ethnic groups in order to have some fun .
It requires us to call into question the workings of all our institutions , including longstanding well @-@ respected ones , and our own practices .
Unlike previous speakers who have cited such cases , I oppose any erosion of national sovereignty in the area of criminal justice .
We are right to condemn Liberia and Burkina Faso for their involvement in the arms trade and the recycling of diamonds .
I know Sri Lanka , I have been there .
The leaders and activists of the opposition parties face constant persecution , in the form of arbitrary arrest and sometimes torture .
Moreover , EU citizens should be dissuaded by their governments from travelling to Burma for their holidays .
I do hope that this match finishes in a sportsmanlike way and I hope that the Belgians will not just win here but also a number of matches during Euro 2000 .
In our opinion , human society should be based on solidarity , human dignity and equality .
The next item is the continuation of the debate on trafficking in women .
Some countries - Italy and Belgium - assisted by NGOs , have already introduced some early measures .
On behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs , we are also requesting that this Initiative of the Republic of Finland should be withdrawn .
This is why , ladies and gentlemen , we are taking every necessary precaution at all Parliament &apos; s places of work .
Whoever votes against , rejects the Finnish proposal and thus gives the Commission the responsibility of presenting a relevant proposal , as represented by the subsequent amendments tabled .
Regulations - that is , either a total ban on fishing or at least clear restrictions on fishing - have been in force for both types of fish on the part of NAFO ever since the 1990s .
In the old days people went out and took risks with their lives and bad equipment ; today they have the capacity to know where the fish are , to get them , and to exploit them and they should have to pay a fee for that .
But , if need be , we will be here to amend it once again .
That concludes the debate .
Explanations of vote must refer to the subject of the debate .
This is a far @-@ reaching debate , engaging all European Union Member States , not one that can be brushed aside .
The entire region is in a state of disarray , which requires the greatest care and concern from the entire European Parliament .
Mr Kronberger was returning from his parliamentary work , he turned left and caused an accident which injured two people .
I would argue that the balance achieved between these two elements of the text adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy makes up for the hard work of the last few months , and , in connection with this , I would like to thank the rapporteur , who joined us in taking a flexible approach to the matter and liasing openly with both the health associations and the producers of tobacco and tobacco products .
This is clearly not , however , a sensible measure .
This is not about one case in isolation but about the responsibility of all of us together .
Consequently , measures to reduce tobacco production will do nothing to reduce consumption ; they will merely boost imports .
I have asthma attack after asthma attack .
We have an opportunity today to send two signals - first , that we care very much about health , but also that we care very much about jobs , employment and deregulation .
It cannot , however , accept Amendments Nos 9 , 17 , 20 , 21 , 34 , 36 , 37 , 40 , 42 or 46 .
But , however it has occurred , the damage to animal life and the environment is equally disastrous and , very often , it of course cuts across national borders .
The need for appropriate coordination with current international conventions and agreements relating to Europe &apos; s seas has also been made clear .
Thank you , Commissioner Liikanen .

Mr President , it is of utmost importance to the citizen for prices to become much more transparent and the cost of roaming to drop , and for the citizen to gain an insight into how this mechanism works .
EU @-@ technology in mobile @-@ phone systems is well advanced .
Where I differ with the rapporteur , however , is with his concerns on spectrum auctions .
When the Commission discussed this issue last time it was decided to make a recommendation to Member States to liberalise the last mile so that both full access and shared access can be guaranteed in the local loop .
Mr President , I voted against the application to withdraw parliamentary immunity .
Subject : Political intervention in Georgia &apos;s problems Georgia , the newly independent state , is encountering serious difficulties in consolidating democracy and raising its citizens &apos; standards of living .
Mr President , of course the Gyllenhammer report is both known and of use to the Commission ; that is our aim within the framework of the social agenda .
I should like to thank the Commission for its answer .
Can the Commission supply information about the negotiations for the inclusion of an article or a protocol in the Treaty ?
Does the Commission not consider that the introduction of a new technology such as digital technology is a commercial risk requiring Community support and that , therefore , radio broadcasting should be included in the MEDIA PLUS programme ?
We have this historical liability but , colleagues , this is not something that can possibly be funded from current research .
At the moment , Europe is having to expand its research and technological development capacities , particularly but not exclusively in the field of the new technologies we have discussed today , but also with a view to closing the gap between Europe and its competitors , the greatest of which are the United States and Japan .
Why not ?
The Swedish Government knew that this derogation was to expire after six months , but all too little has been done to overcome the alcohol abuse which exists .
That is a process that has been undertaken within the United Kingdom .
Quite simply , time is needed to prepare the new alcohol policy and incorporate new features which may reduce the possible risks involved in abolishing import restrictions .
At Russian prices , as we have heard , this means more than 200 litres of the best European beer .
( The sitting was closed at 11.40 p.m. )
He has outlined the matter quite clearly .
One of the ways in which this is expressed is by lobbying for the President &apos; s function to be strengthened and through parliament &apos; s proposals to the intergovernmental conference .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome the fact that we are already able to discuss this issue here today and I should like to start by saying that I consider this , to all intents and purposes , to be the first reading of the Lalumière report , because Mrs Lalumière has invested a great deal of expertise and work in this project .
What the Commission is trying to do is to ensure an effective and coherent Community input into the overall coordinated effort of the Union in this area .
At this initial stage , Mr President , Parliament should be more involved in the development of this policy .
There can be no artificial divide between humanitarian aid and military action .
Pillar II can provide the common positions on things like arms exports , and we could be working towards a European armaments agency which brings together OCCAR and the Western European Armaments Organisation .
Although this was clearly not our desire , the fall of the Berlin wall has obviously not helped with security and defence in Europe .
My own opinion of the legal basis notwithstanding , I really have the greatest respect for the proposals submitted and , above all , for the work carried out by Mr Maaten , who had to process an unbelievably large number of proposals , both in committee and here in Parliament for plenary , in an unbelievably short space of time .
All human beings are involved with each other .
These figures speak for themselves and are terrifying .
Let us remember that the Commission proposed that it would finance this operation by using , at the end of each year , unspent appropriations from heading 3 .
But this should not blind us to the fact that we really moved forward with women &apos; s rights in New York and made significant progress in the areas already mentioned .
Mr Varaut , you are very badly informed . You have made a fool of yourself .
We do not , therefore , intend to interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country at all , and it will be more useful if today &apos; s debate serves to bring about renewed commitment on both sides to the values and undertakings entailed in our partnership .
Others could have referred , for example , to the position of Tunisia on the sharia law .
When Tunisia keeps insisting that we are also talking about fighting extremism and terrorism and preventing extremist views , attitudes and organisations , then I agree with it wholeheartedly .
They are either in place or will be implemented soon .
I regret the fact that there was such little consultation with the Union &apos; s Member States and the European Parliament which are , in the main , supporters not of the fine cause that is the World Trade Organisation , of which we too are part , but of that of the frantic development of global free @-@ trade , to the detriment of our people &apos; s essential interests .
Is the Council aware of this study ?
Does the Council have any strategy for this sensitive region ?
There should be no doubt on this .
They are development measures which are within the spirit of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean partnership .
I am extremely disappointed that the Council , in this way , would want to wash its hands of what is a very serious matter .
The other is the recent re @-@ emergence in Guatemala of political kidnappings , such as that of the university professor Mayra Angelina Gutiérrez , political killings , such as that of the Community leader , José Amancio Mendoza , or threats against journalists ( the case of Gerardi or the Nobel Prize winner , Rigoberta Menchú ) which are of concern .
On the other hand , as Mr Salafranca has pointed out very clearly , I also absolutely share his disagreement not only with the budgetary restrictions , but also with the difficult fact that obstacles are placed in the way of countries such as those in Central America in whose agreements certain clauses have been included , while we do not act in this way in other regions .
I know that some people are critical of this .
Mr Schmitt &apos; s report goes in the right direction and calls on the Commission to take specific steps by proposing legislation .
We have to recognise that finding a balanced solution between simplifying the procedures on the one hand and guaranteeing legal certainty and respect for the rights of asylum seekers on the other hand is not an easy task .
The necessary conditions are broadly present .
I can still remember the earlier debates : late payments are a breach of contract and this directive stipulates that the purchaser must pay the vendor the full sum owed within 30 days of receipt of the goods .
Mr President , I had asked the Commission whether it intended to submit a proposal on conditions for the setting up , and mutual recognition of , debt @-@ collecting agencies in Europe .
Its aim is to create and commit assets and capabilities which will allow us , as planned , to achieve the headline goal .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , it is no cliché to say that , on the eve of the European Council in Feira , this is a decisive moment for the European Union .
The third issue is the Charter of Fundamental Rights . Its content is not in question .
Some Member States are struggling just as hard with granting autonomy to these various cultural and political entities as with relinquishing competences to create a federal Europe .
In the remote regions of the Union we are still wondering , after the Volvo @-@ Scania episode , whether the Internal Market even exists , or is it so , in terms of competition legality , that only companies in the midst of the market may take advantage of the economics of corporate growth , and the sparsely populated remote regions are the markets for these privileged few .
These military dictators remain terrified of a small and gentle woman who has no malice , no uniforms or tanks to protect her .
Through its actions , the Swedish Government has helped obscure this fact in the course of the debate of recent years .
The UK Government position , which is supported by the EPLP , is that it is better to allow this type of negotiation to be undertaken by the works councils .
But there was strong political pressure from the United States , Japan and the European Union , and strong ideological pressure from feminist NGOs generously financed by the Western countries .
However , I would like to strengthen one demand , and that is the demand that in its next report the Commission should devote a special section to reporting on the measures which it has adopted in response to criticisms voiced by Parliament in previous years .
Mr President , I am very grateful to my colleague and friend Mrs Attwooll for her remarks about Amendment No 5 , which is in the name of my colleagues , Nogueira Román and Ortuondo Larrea .
Progress has already been observed , in 1998 , in particular with the setting up in 1997 of territorial pacts for employment involving regional and local partners and both sides of industry .
The transformation of society for which we are looking to the opposition there is virtually impossible under these circumstances .
The money concerned cannot be spent until Belgrade makes a U @-@ turn , but that will only happen if the opposition can express itself .
And in the present situation the Commission has adopted and financed a whole raft of measures which I do not wish to describe in detail now , but which always aimed to enable independent media either to continue to appear , in the case of the print media , or to broadcast , in the case of audio @-@ visual media , or else to open up alternative channels for the media .
Despite the harshness of the repression , the internal decay of the authoritarian regime and the growing mobilisation of civil society eventually forced a transition which opened the way to progress and representative democracy .
While we are voting in favour of the resolution in question , I would like to point out two issues relating to its text .
It must not be used as a pretext for intensifying and strengthening the electronic filing systems created under Europol and Schengen , which target not only refugees but also the fundamental individual freedoms of the citizens of the EU themselves .
Persecution is not just political or caused by the States .
We are talking about the Cohesion Fund and the 1998 audit , on which there is a regulation and criteria which have already been approved for 2000 @-@ 2006 and we do not believe that this is the moment to change the criteria with regard to eligibility and the distribution of those funds .
It seems to me that there is therefore every advantage in immediately integrating into the system three sectors which are not included in the Commission proposal . These are oil , flax and hemp and tobacco .
Data on payments or revenue in respect of the EAGGF , Guarantee section , can only be used at the request of the Commission for closing accounts .
Mr President , I must thank the Commissioner for being present in this almost deserted chamber on a Thursday evening . This House will end up as barren as the programme which you are presenting us with for nuts .
Twenty @-@ one years later I have to tell you that yesterday evening in the forecourt in front of the Tower building , where the motorcyclists were collecting , there were sixteen flags flying .
What is the Centre waiting for to evaluate these strategies ?
We all know that using drugs leads to crime , not only because drugs per se are illegal , but because the high cost of drugs set by the huge financial rings which supply them , inevitably forces all users into crime .
Thank you , Mr President , for allowing me , as rapporteur , to say that the debate we have engaged in this morning is the first opportunity since 1993 , when the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction was opened , to make a statement on the fundamental issue of changing its regulations .
Among other things , the amendments call for a certain degree of harmonisation in European administrative law so that all citizens of the Union receive equal treatment .
In the early days I lived in a border area where the right of freedom of movement of goods and services was not being observed and I found I could get a lot of satisfaction by raising questions directly with the Commission .
Fortunately , they were not sentenced to death , and that may be due to the intervention of Parliament which monitored the proceedings to ensure that the defendants received a fair trial in Iran .
( Parliament rejected the request from the Group of the Party of European Socialists )
In September the Commission will submit its proposals for indicators that will allow us to measure how well we are performing in meeting the goals set at Lisbon .
I am referring to the Statute of MEPs , on which the Portuguese Presidency has continued the work started by the Finnish Presidency , and the Statute of the political parties .
We must tackle the issue of China .
It is perhaps inevitable as we are discussing the ending of the Portuguese Presidency that , with the recent speeches in Berlin , the memory is going to focus more on the second half of the IGC than the first , but I would like at this stage to record my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency for their assiduousness in consulting the Parliament both here in the plenary and in the Constitutional Affairs Committee .
Here Europe needs to act ; here we need more Europe .
What lies behind the incident at Dover , however , is that we have to recognise the inability that Europe has shown to date to fully understand the phenomenon of an ageing population . What this means is that Europe must have its own immigration policy and also the ability to work together on this immigration policy with the home countries of those who wish to come and work in Europe .
Mr President , I came to this opinion on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee with many misgivings .
At the moment , the information is circulating without any guarantee .
Mr President , I should first of all like to pay tribute to the rapporteur , who has put forward a very concise and well @-@ presented report and one that we are happy to support .
Mrs Plooij @-@ Van Gorsel , the simplest way of dealing with the problem you raise is to refer the matter to the quaestors directly .
Mr President , thank you very much for your generosity , and thanks also to my fellow Member for his understanding and kindness .
If a clear majority emerges , then this majority feeling should be expressed in all the aspects of a report , without resorting to playing on words or abusing procedures .
To close , I would like to ask two of those questions .
The third focus of the French Presidency will be to bring Europe closer to the citizens .
We must ensure adequate protection of human health and the environment while at the same time allowing society to benefit from the development of modern biotechnology .
This reform must be ambitious . It cannot be confined to technical amendments just to keep the European machine ticking over .
Mr Barón Crespo mentioned many other things , particularly closer cooperation , development of the social model and enlargement .
Firstly , cultural diversity and implementation of the principle of subsidiarity .
In Berlin , he said we should have enlargement plus constitution at the same time .
Mr President , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , President of the Commission , Ministers , ladies and gentlemen , the requests , proposals and projects presented during these past weeks by Mr Fischer , Mr Bayrou , Mr Monti and Mr Védrine and by President Chirac in Berlin , and Mr Chirac &apos; s speeches here today are all evidence of the fact that , despite setbacks and despite our differences , we have entered a new stage of European construction .
First of all , I wish to say how delighted I am to be here with you and to be speaking on behalf of the French Government , since I was a Member of the European Parliament , before it was located in this superb hemicycle - between 1994 and 1997 .
What is more the European Union mission being by far the largest observer mission deployed in the country and operational right across the nation , also contributed significantly to the coordination of the overall electoral monitoring effort in Zimbabwe .
There is no doubt in Zimbabwe that it has been a case of &quot; Power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . &quot;
Migratory movements are actually due to numerous factors : demographic differences between the North and the South , the continual increase in inequalities of income and wealth between the richest and poorest countries , the instability of certain political situations and the often false image that immigrants have of what a future in Europe might hold for them .
By the same token , we welcome the French initiative to submit a set of guidelines on the conditions for the reception of asylum @-@ seekers .
We do not wish to fall into this trap .
The second element is the provision of legal residence for foreign nationals and , from this point of view , I do not think that a policy of zero immigration is right for Europe .
Does the budget tie in sufficiently with discussions with a social dimension within the European Union , such as those pertaining to consumer affairs , the environment and animal welfare ?
On two occasions we have asked them for trialogues and we have been refused .
We spend EUR 40 million a year on the democratic forces in Serbia and they are asking for two hundred and something more .
Is the Council also aware that China has recently warned Hong Kong and PRC business organisations not to trade with Taiwanese firms whom the PRC deems to be pro @-@ independence ?
Mr President , at the meeting at Feira it was decided to increase flexibility .
The Council has voiced its concerns on several occasions in relation to the illegal diamond trade that is fuelling conflicts in several countries in Africa , for example in Angola , the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone .
The draft presented here can therefore be considered positively by both the Council and Parliament .
Thank you , Commissioner .
However , the fact that the prices of some other forms of energy have spiralled is passed over in modest silence .
Hydroelectric power in the Nordic countries is an environmentally friendly and natural energy source that can often be produced at a competitive price , as is the case at present , thanks to a good water supply .
And we shall only get it if we adopt a clear stance here in Parliament .
They are all in need of considerable modernisation in order to offer identical conditions of competition . The reason for this is that in order to achieve genuine and equitable competition , the right conditions need to be created , they are not simply acquired and excesses must be avoided .
We have now gained some experience in liberalisation thanks to the English and Dutch models .
I am going to tell you why , because I am one of those people who believe that the perfect is the enemy of the good , and that it is better to make progress than to reach an impasse .
The result is that a lot of knowledge is confined to certain areas , in certain universities and in certain companies .
It is vital that Parliament intervenes , but a decisive intervention on the part of the Commission and the Council is also essential when we consider that the possibility of setting up a European civil protection service was even discussed at the Feira Council .
As has already been mentioned , the stage we are now at is that the euro has already been introduced , but the public will only have the bank notes in their hands on 1 January 2002 .
The Group of the Greens totally disagrees with the policy of raising interest rates , which has been applied since the end of 1999 .
Lastly , I wish to raise a third question , which I will at least touch upon .
This morning on the CNN news channel they presented some results of research regarding various intervention policies by the ECB , and the ECB came across as a good intervention @-@ focused bank .
The public needs to be made to feel secure about this .
They have said no in view of the fact that the discussion is not yet concluded and with the forthcoming referenda in mind .
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
Unfortunately , however , Madam President , the Council has not approved of the process whereby these relations have come closer .
The German version is the authoritative version as far as our consultation is concerned , as German is the rapporteur &apos; s language .
This is why , unable as I am to accept either the status quo or the forward march of liberalisation , however progressive and well @-@ planned , I have voted against the Jarzembowski report .
That demonstrates and says a lot about the lack of political will in this area .
Then why accept the Echelon system , which makes us dependent and poorer as the result of lost contracts ?
We think that lawyers / advocates should , to a certain extent , be exempt from the reporting obligation , but the proposals from both the Commission and Parliament are not sufficiently balanced or precise in this respect for us to be able to support them .
It will still be possible , even with the &apos; safe harbour &apos; agreement in place , to find ways of getting round it and selling clients &apos; data to third parties without having to obtain the client &apos; s consent .
Of course , we will have to debate them in the future , when we discuss the budgets for the coming years .
Therefore , the only sensible thing to do is to implement as extensive a ban as is possible in this case .
Several Member States have already imposed a ban on phthalates in toys for children under the age of three .
If this ban is adopted - and we can support it , above all if there is a supposed risk to children - we will also support Amendments Nos 11 , 13 and 24 because the Commission should amend this directive in the event that the Scientific Committee approves the use of methods of measurements for practical purposes .
I should now like to address the matter of the Committee on the Environment , for which I have the honour of acting as rapporteur .
The last 16 years , since the first outbreak of mad cow disease , have demonstrated the importance of production for consumer confidence .
Whenever the regulation might cease to apply , Parliament is called upon to act quickly to prevent a legal vacuum arising .
On this there is agreement between beef producers , the meat processing industry , retailers and consumer organisations .
Before I talk about the amendments tabled for tomorrow &apos; s vote , I would like to make a couple of brief comments about the Council common position approved by the Council on 6 June .
By virtue of the Community patent regulation , patents delivered by the European Patent Office in Munich may become Community patents .
Mr President , I would like to follow up Mrs Kauppi &apos; s question , in relation to the strategy on the level of invention .
Our approach is to guarantee minimum common levels of law enforcement at European level , which does not prevent Member States introducing more stringent or national legislation .
The funds in question actually belong to the Turkish Parliament Foundation and this is financed by the members of parliament in Turkey .
It is true , Mr Nogueira Román , and there is a text with which I must comply , stating that the Cohesion Fund is not subject to additionality requirements .
So I shall be checking with the Greek government that everything is in place at the level of this new Community support framework .
Directive 96 / 61 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control , the IPPC Directive , states that Member States must take all necessary measures that are required in order to restore industrial land that is no longer in use .
That surely serves no purpose at all .
The Commission is therefore able to approve Amendment 19 ( 4 ) in principle , provided that it does not lead to the EMAS rules &apos; being watered down for small and medium @-@ sized companies .
Amendment 3 ( 1 ) refers to the fact that the Member States should make a special effort to inform those who are affected by the extensions to the time limits within which the limit values for benzene are to be complied with .
In that case we will have failed those Member States most in need of assistance and guidance , and the consequence will be no change in the status quo and no improvement in those Member States &apos; implementation .
Mr President , the content of the regulation being discussed here is based on the situation that existed at the end of the 1980s , but since then things have changed greatly .
During production and afterwards , an adequate promotion and marketing budget is generally lacking .
I also believe that this industry will be the spearhead of this century , in the same way as coal , steel and the infrastructure of railways were the impetus for the development of the revolution in the 19th century .
These mechanisms must seek to overcome the obstacles of the national markets and profit fully from an enlarged area of distribution .
So do not be too surprised if this Parliament backs the rapporteur and tries to push the Council to live up to the fine words they were so ready to utter .
Naturally , Parliament will be informed of the results of that conference .
For example , they have replied to unanswered letters , made payments that are due and reversed previous unfavourable decisions .
My group congratulates the Ombudsman on the work he accomplished in 1999 .
And , goodness me , these instructions certainly are necessary !

Hopefully the Commissioner today can bring forward a timetable for when those delays will cease .
Eurocontrol has proven to be inadequate as a mechanism for managing air traffic .
Mr President , I am acting as the representative of the air traffic controllers protesting against the European Commission proposal which , in the name of the attractive slogan &quot; single European sky &quot; , will clear the way for the privatisation of air traffic control .
Secondly , these measures do nothing to protect the reproductive health of men and women .
Lastly , I wish to sound a warning about point 9 of this report , because measures for protecting new mothers , such as very long maternity leave , may have unwanted effects , as it may become disadvantageous for employers to employ women , and they may consequently prefer to take on men .
I must accept these criticisms since they are true and are based on real facts .
. ( EL ) There are serious reservations regarding the proposal to amend Regulation EC No 1251 / 1999 on flax and hemp grown for fibre because of the unfair allocation of quotas between the Member States .
Mrs Rühle &apos; s report on the various EDFs clearly confronts the Commission with its responsibilities ; it demands more clarity for all future aid distributed by the Community for the benefit of developing countries .
I was unable to vote in favour of the compromise resolution , mainly because the paragraph on taxation is a little too sparse and casts a biased judgement on what was really decided in Feira .
We now know that the Dutch justice system is launching an inquiry .
The Commission is currently preparing a proposal to the Council on the application of Article 366a of the Lomé Convention because , in its the view , the fundamental principles of the Convention - democracy , the rule of law and respect for human rights - are no longer guaranteed in Fiji .
We have raised this issue repeatedly during the bilateral dialogue with China on the subject of human rights .
Madam President , the Moluccas require our attention once again .
I have been a frequent visitor to the law school of the University of Texas and to other law schools in the United States .
It is still too easy for hooligans to move around with complete impunity within the countries of the European Union .
We called for the embargo on food and medicines to be lifted , because it hits the Iraqi people and not Saddam Hussein .
This emergency humanitarian aid provided by the NGOs could not have occurred without the Commission &apos; s financial support and I therefore wish to praise all those who made it possible .
Mr President , I will tell you immediately that the ELDR group refused to sign the joint resolution for a very simple reason : we find it a little over @-@ emotional , while not forceful enough , and does not offer the possibility of a more political and more balanced choice in the name of Parliament .
This is certainly a positive measure .
In practice the problem is a minor one , however , as the European toy industry has , in the main , stopped using phthalates .
The other dubious solution is the headlong rush to strengthen the eleven members of the euro zone , which is supposed to lead gradually to a single European economic government .
That just goes to show !
Short sea shipping is therefore not a competitor of road transport , the train or transport using inland waterways , it is one of the modes in the transport chain .
Mr President , in this group we welcome the Peijs report and we welcome the Commission &apos;s stance to which it is responding .
That is what the rapporteur has been striving for .
It is , in fact , not so much the content of the present Treaty or present declarations which is at issue , in fact he is more concerned to adapt these declarations , presumably in such a way as to form a legal basis from them , so that a programme can be based on them .
Therefore , when we have the remaining versions we will proceed with the approval of the Minutes .
Perhaps , for example , through efficient investigations promptly carried out , by sharing the information obtained in this way and by ensuring that these investigations are carried out by staff knowledgeable about the environment .
On an international level we have seen many many disasters in the past , just to take Bhopal as an example .
The first difficulty that I see in truly applying this proposal is in categorising environmental crimes , given the diversity within the Union .
The worst environmental crimes are those perpetrated by companies , for which it is just part of their business .
Ladies and gentlemen , once again it is my sad duty to open our plenary sitting against the background of the violence in the Spanish Basque Country which has intensified dramatically over the summer .
I would ask you and other Members to bear in mind , when considering this issue and when it comes for debate that , although Gibraltar is part of the European Union , the residents of Gibraltar do not themselves have direct representation in this Parliament .
Of course he is a German politician , but the German Government is empowered and in a position to speak for Germany .
In this regard , I must add that the commercial balance between these two blocks favours the European Union to the tune of EUR 21 billion .
Eliminating tension and promoting balanced development in the Mediterranean third countries leads to greater security , prosperity and prospects for the European Union .
But where the budget is concerned , the European Union &apos;s own budget , you are the executive .
The numerous officials in the Commission who deal with external relations , taking on competencies of prime importance , are technical specialists but in general they lack the prior diplomatic training , which is necessary to fulfil their duties .
The issue of diplomacy is not merely a question of training diplomats and the status of delegations . The issue is of fundamental importance and there is a powerful taboo in this Parliament which we are never prepared to confront : that we have fifteen national diplomatic services , which have been strengthened over years of integration by gradually taking over the competencies of all the national ministries and which have become the real powers , the main power blocking any possible reform of foreign affairs and diplomacy , because it is their power that would ultimately be under threat .
Yes , the Commission needs to recruit a different sort of personnel .
Last and by no means least , it is very important that they are provided with adequate physical protection in what is an , often , very dangerous world .
We need more time to present a properly thought through and fundamentally revised programme .
Unfortunately , humanitarian aid cannot play this role and must not serve only to bail out a liberal policy which at the same time murders the populations of the countries in receipt of aid .
Yesterday , as you know , this House paid its respects to the victims of terrorism in Spain and observed a minute &apos; s silence in their memory .
Finally , Europe has developed a cooperation policy with all the countries in the Middle East in a bid to create the right conditions for harmonious economic and social development and , at the same time , strengthen regional integration , which is crucial if peace is to gain a permanent foothold .
I hope that the document and its implementation will help to consolidate political developments in the region .
There has been peaceful progress on the Lebanese @-@ Israeli border since the Lebanese Government gained authority within the region , and we all must certainly welcome the fact that southern Lebanon is now at peace .
Jerusalem is the key issue and it needs to be looked at in a new light .
That is why the French Presidency is determined to ensure that the IGC is a success and conclude &apos; a nice treaty in Nice &apos; , in order to prevent any delays to enlargement and ensure that we can welcome the first candidate countries to a Union with more efficient institutions .
That is why the Commission participates fully in the decision @-@ making process in the Council , that is why we have a shared right of initiative - not a sole but a shared right of initiative - in these issues .
Report ( A5 0191 / 2000 ) by Mr Imbeni , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament : Assessment and future of Community humanitarian activities ( Article 20 of Regulation ( EC ) 1257 / 96 ) ( COM ( 1999 ) 468 - C5 0044 / 2000 - 2000 / 2016 ( COS ) ) .
In it , she voices her belief that it would have come to riots in Austria had the 14 EU States not imposed sanctions against Austria .
But the Council &apos; s decision seems to be leading to a situation now where the whole development of the security and defence policy in the political sphere can no longer be properly monitored , being , as it were , beyond that .
In my opinion , it is not right to ask us to choose between the Balkans and developing countries .
However we have not followed up the Commission &apos; s proposal for a revision of the financial perspectives , transferring these appropriations to category 7 , and we have kept them in category 4 .
To date , there has been no application for us to release these funds .
Admittedly , mother @-@ child transmission prevention programmes remain essential , but there is still a need for massive implementation of projects to provide access to treatment for chronic infection , because who is going to raise these children after we have saved them from infection ?
Madam President , everyone in this debate has emphasised the importance of preventive measures .
This information mechanism should assist the social dialogue between employers and employees and it could support public authorities by providing information data and analysis of existing information on industrial change .
This is a key point .
In addition , the Council is constantly attentive to the rights of the child wherever issues relating to human rights are dealt with .
It must be considered , however , that if this is made a requirement within the European Union , then this is the requirement within the body to which the candidate countries wish and are going to accede .
I therefore do not see how future enlargement can be carried out at the expense of Mediterranean agriculture under the financial perspectives for 2000 @-@ 2006 .
In an ordinary democracy it is , of course , the rule that all decisions concerning new laws are made publicly in a parliament and that the debates too are held in public .
Some people would do well not to boast and brag because these Greek @-@ Turkish relations constantly result in the Greek Government &apos; s backing down and that in itself is a source of further tension .
However , this should not prevent us from defining it in the digital age , because these principles are very important to us all , and , as infrastructure has developed , so content is going to develop as well .
To fail to act would be like an ostrich burying its head in the sand .
The Commission also agrees with Parliament that the principle of a clear demarcation between editorial content and advertising should be maintained in all forms of media .
I commend it to the House .
These are agreements which benefit both parties and which have been amended over time , being adapted to the demands of the sustainable exploitation of resources and of actions supporting the efforts of the authorities in the third countries to develop their own fishing sector .
Among the most important features of the protocol is the fact that , in view of the small quantities of fish caught during the three years that the last protocol was in force , the authorised tonnage has been reduced from 7 500 tonnes to 5 500 tonnes , which will also lead to a corresponding reduction - namely of 29 % - in compensation payments .
If I had told you ten years ago , before the Gulf War , that in the year 2000 the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council would have a debate with the Speaker of the Israeli Knesset before the European Parliament , you would have said that it would never happen .
Then he said to him &apos; If this can happen between us and our worst ever enemy , there is no reason in the world why it should not happen between you and the Palestinians in your generation because the rivalry is not that deep . &apos; 
The Commission has put forward the first draft of a legislative initiative in this field , which concerns the right to family reunification .
Mr President , Commissioner , the present document , like the report , is a labelling con .
This is not , however , an absolute right of the third @-@ country citizens who reside in the Union &apos; s Member States , and reside there lawfully .
If we are to appeal to our citizens and the basic right of free movement is to be real , then simple , fast codification of this area of Community law is long overdue .
Firstly the Commission has failed to deal with the issue of the 12 to 14 million third @-@ country nationals living legally in the Union who currently suffer discrimination and , outside the Union &apos;s island States can move freely de facto but cannot do so legally , which of course creates situations in which they are exploited and used in illegal ways .
It does , however , ensure that particularly at our respective borders our planning takes account of the environment quality within and across our borders when planning frameworks are being agreed .
These amendments seem to be inspired by the fear of the assessment being duplicated .
The conditions for the delivery of waste by ships at Community ports have been the topic of many a discussion .
I would like once again to thank Parliament for standing firm on the need for a strengthened mechanism for reviewing the fees system , which will undoubtedly allow us to move forward and make a detailed study of the current system which we have implemented and the consequences for the environment .
Madam President , the stir which the Bouwman report has caused shows quite well the chaos European decision @-@ making finds itself in and what kind of complex compromises are being struck as a result .
It uses the environment to infiltrate everywhere ; it uses our water pipes to spread its tentacles into national policy .
Madam President , I voted against the Watson report , as did the whole of the Group of the European People &apos; s Party , not just because the amendments tabled by the group - of which I have the pleasure of being a member - were not adopted , but also because the pensioners are tired of seeing European Union territory increasingly filling up with third @-@ country nationals who do not have the means to live .
I do not understand the problem .
It must be admitted , however , that the participation rate is still low , given that this programme involves 18 Member States .
You can write to the services to correct the verbatim report .
The telecommunications sector has become a symbol of capitalist globalisation , which forces it to bear the cost of this race towards ever more enormous deals .
As to the general effect on employment , I firmly believe that if competition is maintained employment tends to benefit .
We need to have a wide @-@ ranging , democratic debate on this historic project .
If , Commissioner , you meant that some statesmen in our governments like to go on central European tours and announce that enlargement is on its way but then leave the details to the Commission , you should say so plainly and we will back you up when you confront the Council with this .
Lastly , we propose that a temporary committee be set up to study these issues .
The treatment of the human embryo as a consumer article , supposedly justified by the argument that this is in the name of research , fills me with disgust , especially because there are other ways of cloning stem cells .
This is why the European Union &apos; s action in this field must be guided by major fundamental principles alone .
As a result , in the framework @-@ programme , this is clearly completely excluded at the moment .
Therefore assisting reform of domestic water policies in the countries of the Middle East is a priority .
It should also be borne in mind that for the duration of Euro 2000 , the Belgian and Dutch Governments made use of a safeguard clause in Article 2 ( 2 ) of the Schengen Agreement , which lays down that , when public order or national security are threatened - and in my view , the fear generated by these cases of &apos; hooliganism &apos; certainly meets these criteria - a Member State may decide that , for a limited period , national border controls , adapted specially for the situation , can be implemented , even at internal borders within the Schengen area .
The level of cooperation and the forms of collaboration between the Commission and NGOs are of particular concern to all Ministers without portfolio whose programmes are implemented through NGOs and who have , I would say , a special burden to bear in the social field .
The arbitration body is still working on this and has not resolved the issue conclusively as yet .
We were faced with the problem of producing a rigorous definition of what we called good groundwater status .
Mr President , Commissioner , it was a very turbulent night sitting in which Parliament , the Council and the Commission agreed upon a common water policy for all Member States .
All in all , I believe that , apart from the issue of cost , this Directive is a great success and marks a step forward .
They claim it will have crippling effects on the European economy and that too is nonsense .
On the other hand , air travel has an obvious detrimental effect upon the environment due to exhaust emissions and noise pollution .
If the current rate of growth is maintained , the improvements needed to compensate for the anticipated environmental impact of the increase in air traffic will not be made .
More road users will die if Mr de Roo &apos;s amendments are passed .
That is the purpose of my amendments , to which a large majority of the committee agreed .
Or look at Scandinavia .
Secondly , thorough checks , including cross @-@ border checks , by the relevant authorities are necessary .
Sports federations and governments should be able , if they so wish , to take appropriate measures to protect the clubs that develop young talent .
Thus , when buying a drug , sportsmen and women will be able to clearly see the red traffic light indicating the risk of testing positive , or the green light which indicates that there is no risk , or the amber light indicating that there may be a risk and that they should contact their doctor or a specialist for advice .
Only the gods on Mount Olympus can say whether top @-@ level sport is healthy or not - we certainly cannot .
Thank goodness we have President Buffet and the French Presidency which , I think , has taken up and taken a leading role in the matter of unifying and developing and strengthening our sporting structures .
Voluntary organisations and individual volunteers are every bit a part of the sporting world , and it is surely thanks to them that sport is alive in our countries and that mass sport will be able to survive in future .
What finer symbol could there be to demonstrate the union , the collaboration , we have seen between the political and sporting worlds in this arena today ?
I intend to submit a communication to the Commission on proclaiming the year 2004 the European Year of Sport .
Our Parliament could not have endorsed a text which was nothing more than a statement of intent .
As long as the car industry succeeds in doing this , they , themselves , do not have to look into reducing pollution caused by cars , or incur any additional costs as a result .
There are two points of view , with no real great difference between them .
Then there is the problem of gas emissions .
In our opinion , such powers are covered by the subsidiarity principle and ought to be exercised at national or lower levels of political decision @-@ making .
It is only because of Mr Nikitin , and the independent media , which face increased repression , that we heard about the disaster at all , four days after the event.Thanks to international support , it was at least possible to avoid the very worst and I hope that it will also be possible to find a solution .
B5 0726 / 2000 by Mrs Maes and Mr Rod , on behalf of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , on the situation in Burundi ;
I hope they will be given every encouragement to do so .
Mr President , I would like to make it clear that the fact that Iran has been replaced by Burma in the debate on human rights does not mean that my group is not deeply concerned about the human rights situation in Iran .
The reality that is currently devastating the country is quite different , Mr President .
Otherwise , it is not acceptable for it to become a part of this Union .
I appeal once again to the Czech Government to act voluntarily now in just the same way as they would have to act if they already belonged to the European Union and were a member of our great European family .
B5 @-@ 0746 / 2000 by Mrs Ainardi and others , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on the fires in the Mediterranean regions ;
The fundamental ethnic antagonism in Fiji must be resolved .
The latter are generally united with one people , one common history , one language and more or less one culture .
Obviously , education for the integration of immigrants is not the same as training for new qualifications , training for a first job or retraining , or many other types .
This new sort of literacy has to be taught to many adults starting at the beginning .
Hopefully the change in attitudes will also be reflected before long in the Union &apos; s budget .
Despite identifying certain shortcomings in the system , Mr Gutiérrez @-@ Cortines &apos; report fails to go far enough in analysing the causes or suggesting remedies , which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote .
If we succeed in ensuring that , at least in this Parliament , no one can stoop to making racist remarks , then our words and our actions will carry much more weight outside Parliament .
That is to say , we need a virtuous policy , but at the same time we are now facing a particularly complex situation in that there are a series of professions who are in a very difficult position and which , as forms of Community @-@ scale protests are developing in Europe , has lead to blockades and disorder and disparate reactions from our governments .
Energy supply is more elastic than demand .
It is also necessary to continue making progress on transport policies and we must avoid , as a result of a crisis such as this , suddenly changing our transport policy and energy policy which has been established over recent years .
More basic changes are needed when it comes to the rules governing the registers .
This still does not seem sufficient to us , and we hope that , at least in the legislative and supervisory field , we can have further competences .
Many of these accidents - many of which can be avoided - come about because of the poor use of scaffolding or ladders .
You cannot have red lights everywhere .
300 000 of those accidents are serious enough to cause the employees to be absent from work more than three days .
Amendments Nos 24 and 25 must be rejected because training is already adequately covered , especially following Amendments Nos 16 , 19 and 22 .
It would therefore appear that the Commission has a keener sense of fair trading than the European Parliament , despite the fact that , logically @-@ speaking , the opposite should apply . It is the European Parliament which should be more sensitive to the social impact of competition policy .
Although we have cause to congratulate ourselves on the financial contribution agreed in the course of the conciliation - and I should like to thank the rapporteur on behalf of my group - the budget in question is still modest , given the considerable needs and still greater expectations of the populations concerned .
We have to develop the sort of aid that by its nature prevents conflicts , and does not fuel them .
There was a rapid reaction from the Member States too .
That is why we are also proposing that , at the end of the first year in which the scheme has been implemented , the Commission should present the European Parliament with a precise interim report providing , in particular , an update on the situation regarding each COM concerned .
It requires creativity to find sound solutions for farmers and industry within the strict boundaries of the World Trade Organisation .
I just wanted to give you advance notice .
ADRs , therefore , cannot be a replacement for legal remedy .
This is important , and I do not believe that the same weight would have been given to this issue if this work had not been done .
A Europe without borders is to the benefit of consumers .
Mr President , forgive me for being more of a bore than I usually am , but the valid arguments and especially the passion of the criticisms that have been made deserved a frank answer from the Commission .
I would like to end , Mr President , by sparing a thought for those Europeans most affected by fear , in other words , the victims of terrorism and their families .
Political dialogue cannot be achieved when , with one hand , or at a given moment , people call for dialogue and with the other , they turn a pistol or a bomb on those with whom they are supposedly in talks .
In the East , right @-@ wing groups no longer regard themselves as a minority , but believe they hold centre stage in society , and they have cult status among young people .
Mr President , &apos; They died because they looked different , thought differently and lived a different kind of life . &apos; So read the title of an article in a daily newspaper on right @-@ wing extremist violence in Germany .
Parliament has no trouble appeasing its conscience on this matter , making solemn declarations and financing useless initiatives and monitoring centres .
The Council is bound , nonetheless , to comply with the terms of the Treaty . The legal framework does not , in fact , allow it to consult Parliament on strategy papers currently being studied within the offices of the Council .
During the debate late last night there were at least ten speakers who all raised points very critical of the Commission .
On these issues , the European Union gives Europe &apos; s democracies a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .
Member States must therefore devote some effort to reducing the taxes and deductions that weigh down on employment .
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday , 15 December 2000 .
Looking at the instances individually , we wonder why they are not given the highest priority .
Credit institutions
The Commission can go along with the spirit of these amendments , as is apparent in its explanatory statement .
An attempt was made there to improve the quality of legislation , to try to cut down on superfluous legislation and to limit the costs associated with implementing legislation .
But there is room for the Commission to coordinate and improve evaluation systems as provided for in the Treaty and I was glad to see that the Commission was careful to emphasise that this is to be based on voluntary cooperation between the Member States .
So again , I welcome the fact that this report has come before the House , because its aim is both to improve school education and the quality evaluation thereof .
It strengthens the sense of belonging to the European Union by identifying the roots we all share .
It is to be welcomed that the Culture 2000 programme has allocated one third of its budget to cultural , archaeological , underwater and architectural heritage and to museums , libraries and archives , thereby strengthening national action .
Needless to say , there are also areas of concern with regard to the 1997 discharge .
Surely this is a reasonable demand ?
I am dealing with four reports relating to the dairy sector , the cereals sector and swine fever involving total spending of approximately EUR 16 billion , which is a considerable proportion of the budget .
The Fund is , in fact , an international organisation with its own governing body , rules , audit procedures and so on . Furthermore , the European Union is just one of five donors involved in its financing .
Mr Staes &apos; report on European Union aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina rightly condemns the serious financial mismanagement in the Office of the High Representative ( OHR ) during a dramatic period , what is more , and once again , at the expense of monies belonging to the citizens of Europe .
They allow for better monitoring of transit processes and the handling of securities undertaken for the purpose of safeguarding these processes .

I would also like to particularly support Amendment No 3 from the Socialist Group .
The very word BSE ought to inspire us to reflect on what kind of young enterprises we could establish in order better to guarantee food safety , carry out blood tests , develop treatments and so on . Urgent action is called for here .
Moreover , I also regret the fact that the frontier effect test has not even been included in the social agenda and that the Treaty of Nice has not made any decisions with regard to Regulation 1408 / 71 , which only complicates matters .
Mr President , I voted for the Sanders @-@ ten Holte report .
Indeed , I am sure that , if the Palestinian citizens were in better health and their economy were improved , there would be less war than I am sorry to say there is at the moment . &quot;
But if we now examine the situation , we could ask ourselves whether there are any young people left out there who are mad enough to become farmers in the European Union .
Secondly , my contribution should of course be considered as an appeal to the Social Council and the Commission , but mainly the Social Council , to do something about this dossier at long last , particularly in the knowledge that this is the start of the necessary deregulation of the movement of workers across Europe .
We have also worked to create a clear link between implementation of the directives and Community cofunding which has proven to be very effective as well as ensuring a close relationship with the LIFE financial instrument , because when they see that the money is threatened if they do not comply with the regulations this will definitely put pressure on the Member States .
We owe it to those future generations to pursue this issue .
In doing so it , in turn , must rely on information supplied to it by the Member States .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European organisation CEJA for its help and cooperation in enabling me to produce this report .
In the mid @-@ 1980s , the CAP began changing in order to improve measures for direct control of production with the aim of preventing surpluses and guaranteeing the stability of prices and incomes .
Allow me to say a few brief words on the social aspects . Time and again I hear farmers using various arguments to put off leaving their farms to their children or successors .
Mr President , honourable Members , I should like to start by thanking you , Mr Parish , for your earnest report on the situation and perspectives of young farmers in the European Union .
I would still like to ask the Commissioner , based on a real cost @-@ price analysis for companies in Europe and elsewhere , also taking into consideration the genetically modified aspect , to again cast a critical eye over whether these regulations outside the scope of active improvement could not , in fact , be applied more forcefully .
Consequently , it can be difficult to issue recommendations and still more difficult to issue a directive which would , as it were , be applicable everywhere and clarify all these various aspects .
Secondly , what is intended in this White Paper - in which we shall have the opportunity to discuss all these issues in great depth , and in which problems of charging and the competitiveness of the various modes of transport , etc . , will also appear - is precisely to make progress in sorting out bottlenecks , which does not mean that in some cases we shall not have to think about enhancing certain road infrastructures .
Situations change and so does the pattern of how we distribute through different partners .
It is fully aware of the crucial role of development cooperation in this context .
The European Parliament is today offering this report to which I refer as food for thought for everyone on the eve of an historic reform of the common fisheries policy , so that we can all be clear about where we are and where we have to get to .
The new year is a time of hope and expectation , especially for our fishermen .
Lastly , as Mr Gallagher has pointed out , we would like to see an exclusion zone of 24 miles for coastal fishing .
Mr President , European Union fisheries policy is a vast subject .
Both reports start from the same premise .
In addition to these factors , the political situation , as has already been mentioned , still shows a worrying degree of instability on all counts .
A particularly regrettable aspect of this activity is that anti @-@ personnel landmines have reportedly been laid along the border by the Burmese .
In addition , it was agreed to make all information concerning this incident available to the United Nations Environment Programme .
We hear , however , that the deployed weapons set off chemical processes on impact , processes which result in the creation of uranium oxide , for example , and which may pose problems .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in 1950 , when I was 20 years old , a campaign exploded throughout the entire world : in Europe , in our universities , in schools - they attempted without success as yet to penetrate the churches - and it was the campaign against Ridgway , the &quot; Plague General . &quot;
I thank the High Representative for promising us complete information and transparency .
Mr President , on a point of order . Perhaps we could just settle that point of order now .
This new mechanism will certainly meet a need , so much so that demand could soon exceed supply .
Therefore do you not think it is a very positive and sensible suggestion for the European Union to have a department that does precisely that ?
Dialogue is the way forward .
Having been told that I am the representative of the Italian Pensioners &apos; Party , he complained to me : &quot; I go out to sea to fish , I work whenever it is possible and I would like to work many days so that I can have a pension as well .
- ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten &apos; s report on the situation of frontier workers in the European Union .
It seems incredible but it is true , that in Ireland , where agriculture has long been one of the economic bases of the country , farmers are now beginning to wonder whether their sons or daughters will be able to carry on the family tradition .
Mr President , I voted for this report for I - and the Pensioners &apos; Party - consider that , before taking important decisions , the European Parliament - and not only Parliament but all the government bodies - should consult the groups , peoples and citizens concerned .
.
Access by the special representative remains , of course , a key preoccupation .
I think we have to be aware of the situation in the United States .
There is an urgent need for a robust statement on these practices in Geneva , as I see it , and I also call upon the European Union to table a resolution in this vein .
Here we are of the same mind : we regard enlargement as a moral , historic and political duty and one that must not be delayed , whatever the decision we take on Nice .
It is also totally unacceptable that applicant countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary should have been directly discriminated against in that they will receive fewer places in the European Parliament than EU countries with comparable populations .
On the other hand , we hope that Sweden , as the country holding the presidency , will be able to achieve the success required in the work of enlargement .
On a final note , the proposal to integrate environmental aspects into other policy areas , such as taxation of energy , is to be welcomed with open arms .
I hope we can resolve the differences on factual matters which exist between the Commission , the Council and Parliament so that we can make some progress on the issue of enlargement .
I want to address a second point .
With regard to the standard of Turkish prisons , the EU has repeatedly demanded a prison system in Turkey which conforms to international standards .
The living conditions of the Iraqi people , together with the endeavour to achieve lasting security and stability in the area , are the most important issues for the Council with regard to its policy towards Iraq .
Are there any proposals for compensation to fishermen ?
Hence , the Community adopted Council Regulation 3922 / 91 .
In general , taxation should focus on a car &apos; s use and not its purchase price .
Of course , if we take care to ensure that any measures taken receive widespread support , then they will be even more effective and if , at the same time , we draw on the experiences of the Member States in these areas , then we shall be sure to strike a happy medium .
I agree with Mr Stenmarck when he says - and this is made plain by the previous discussion - that we should never accept safety levels that are lower than those which it is possible to bring about .
Perhaps the pressure on the transporters and the shippers is not yet so great as to bring about this breakthrough .
( DE ) Mr President , Vice @-@ President of the Commission , Mr Costa , ladies and gentlemen , I want to give high praise to the rapporteur for his success in achieving a broad consensus with his report , after we have spent years in this House hotly debating the right way to charge for transport infrastructure costs .
In our efforts to secure sustainable mobility , we must concentrate specifically on those forms of transport which do society and the environment the least damage .
To prevent that discussion also means preventing the integration of the various modes of transport and is therefore no more than lobbying , or a policy of lobbying for the status quo .
We need to combat ignorance and outmoded clichés about gender roles .
Because the issues involved are social protection , the value of family work , qualifications and skills , working conditions , working hours and much more besides .
So the aim must be the adoption of national electoral regulations which provide for the creation of parity lists .
Excellent examples have been cited in this Chamber , which prove that wherever quotas have been applied in conjunction with all the policies which I have just mentioned , they have had positive results .
Now the basis of the activity is changing and the focus is on new approaches .
Wood regrows , it rots and finds its way back into the natural cycle from which it came .
When human rights appeals come from those suffering from the lack of human rights or from associations working genuinely to relieve the burden of oppression , at least in the areas they are responsible for , we show our solidarity .
When the price of fuel is prohibitive , at five to six times the refinery sale price because more than 80 % of the price is made up of taxes , you might well think that the road user is already paying more than enough for the right to use the public road network in proportion to the use he makes of his car . That is without mentioning all the other types of road tax ; it is too long a list and the litany of amounts involved is too depressing .
For one , the Commission and rapporteur largely limit sustainability in the forestry sector to replacement planting alongside cutting .
Although I welcome the establishment of the courts I have a number of reservations .
These are just so many deliberate , calculated sallies in Russia &apos; s muddled geopolitical game , and just as many reasons for us to use our votes to express our condemnation of Russia &apos; s machinations involving its former vassal state and to take practical action to assist the political stabilisation of this region and its economic take @-@ off , and , of course , to appoint , as the resolution proposes , a Special Envoy for the Caucasus : since a gust of wind in the southern Caucasus may indeed blow Europe away .
We should rightly express our concern at what has happened and that the situation was allowed to deteriorate so far .
The hopes raised in Algeria and throughout the world by President Bouteflika &apos; s civil concord initiative must not give way to the disenchanted view that there is really nothing that can be done in this country to eradicate violence and establish the rule of law .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
But you will have seen that two days ago President Kostunica , who only recently was making solemn speeches in Parliament , refused to receive Justice Del Ponte because she was allegedly not of equal rank in accordance with the rules of protocol .
The situation today for the implementation of this programme is that these people have now been working in Managua since early autumn .
Accordingly , and this concerns thousands of people every year throughout the Union , a holder of a long @-@ stay visa and who has not yet received a residence permit , is in the least favourable position by comparison with other third @-@ country nationals as far as freedom of movement in the Schengen area is concerned .
We must treat people fairly and with dignity and remove the stigma of visa stays .
I should like to draw your and Parliament &apos; s attention to a man @-@ made disaster with which we shall be confronted in the course of the next few days .
I am convinced of two points in this respect , and these convictions are shared by the Commission as a whole .
The Voivodships in Poland have only been in existence for two years .
I even , as you identified earlier , mentioned the new context of cohesion policy associated with globalisation , which constitutes the risk which Jacques Delors and others clearly identified fifteen years ago , and which impelled them to propose this cohesion policy .
We would have liked the meeting at Feira to refer to the MEDA programme , since it is the main instrument for implementing this policy and will be allocated a financial package of EUR 5.37 billion for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 , excluding funds from the European Investment Bank .
It is inhuman and ineffective to advocate the free movement of goods and capital but not of people .
In particular , we would point out that it is the developed capitalist countries which are responsible for the current state of the underdeveloped countries .
I sincerely hope that the European Union will achieve its goal of strengthening economic , political and cultural ties with the countries of the Mediterranean Basin .
Nevertheless , in substance a good deal of progress had been made towards agreement on this instrument .
The European Union has intervened with the Palestinian Authority in connection with the death sentences recently carried out . The Union has also intervened in Israel to condemn the extra @-@ judicial executions of Palestinians , corroborated by military sources .
We must support both sides in their journey towards a solution to the conflict , based on the peaceful resolution of differences , on tolerance , on respect for human rights and the consolidation of peace .
According to spokespeople from both camps , these have now been concluded , and not without hope for the future .
What we found was an explosive atmosphere generated by fanatical people who are incapable of reaching compromises and for whom principles rule the day . They are there on both sides , I might add , although there appear to be more of them amongst the fundamentalist settlers , many of whom are still fairly new to the country .
And that was my hope .
There has been , indeed , an increased flow of refugees crossing the border in the affected areas .
Mr President , I am convinced that generosity , realism , and bold and imaginative proposals are the way forward . Above all , good will is the key to a solution to the Colombian problem which the European Union is able to endorse , as the Council and Commission representatives have stated here today .
Mr President , I wish to ask for clarification on two points .
If enlargement means we get a transport system that is a little fairer and also friendlier to the environment , it will meet with greater acceptance .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , there is talk in this Chamber of who the winners in this conciliation are .
We are setting up a European rail network which does not yet exist , to replace 15 national juxtaposed networks .
That is why I do not want to restrict it to trade alone .
Until now , the European Union has produced its own energy efficient standards , often mandatory and the European Parliament has taken seriously its responsibility as a co @-@ legislator to see that such standards are sufficiently stringent .
Why did this report require so much care , including a time- and energy @-@ consuming Conciliation Procedure , even though many may perhaps say the honourable Members are acting as though the world is being turned upside down , when it is basically just a matter of detail ?
Therefore , in order to make it effective , another resolution has already been prepared on the mutual recognition of final decisions . I have referred to it in this motion for a resolution as well in order to provide a mosaic , a complete raft of actions intended precisely to make this judicial cooperation more effective .
As I say , we plan to vote in committee on Monday 5 February and debate the report in Parliament &apos; s sitting of Monday 12 in Strasbourg , in order that the vote can be held on 13 February and thereby meet the deadlines that we have been set .
Fats must be sterilised by pressure cooking . End of story !
According to Commissioner Byrne , a patent application is pending .
In order to do this , I call upon the Commission , as I have done on countless occasions , to provide clarification , that is to make all data available to allow correct information to contribute to reducing this collective psychosis of which , it appears , even we have been victims in part .
I have to say that in this connection , the Commission has been far more consistent over the past few years than the Council , just to quote an example .
My distinguished predecessor Ms Bonino had something to say on the subject of enforcement .
Moreover , the statement made by the Commission on the state of progress in the fight against BSE clearly demonstrates that , where prevention is possible , it is always far more effective than intervention after the event ; as the saying goes , prevention is better than cure .
I grew up in a pretty humble background , in a poor area with impoverished expectations and poor prospects .
We shall not look at any specific dates or format just now , but do let us discuss this together , so that we can select the best possible option for inclusion in the Culture 2000 programme .
That is why a more common trade policy is not expedient .
The legitimacy of such a body to override national judicial rulings would be questionable , and the judicial discretion of Member States &apos; legal authorities should be preserved .
If we add , in the crossfire of relations , parties which run governments , parties which are in opposition , and if we add all the desires of this House , on Thursday we are going to hold a debate , at a rather unfortunate time , on the 15 Member States . Please have no doubt about that .
The Cairo Conference and the Beijing Women &apos;s Conference both stated the same thing .
Mr President , the sinking of the oil tanker Erika off the French coast approximately one year ago has rightly exercised our minds a great deal .
Apart from these two points , we are able to support the proposals in general .
The Council reached agreement at the end of December so that the directive can come into force as from 2002 .
The truth is that the Erika accident would probably never have happened if all the regulations in force at the time had been properly complied with and if , furthermore , that compliance had been monitored correctly .
Improved competitiveness in the railways is vital to relieve road and air congestion .
The standardisation of technical features will result in improved competitiveness on the railways without there being any negative effects on the status of other forms of transport .
In particular , I welcome the flexible approach towards establishing a closed area and the pragmatic use of derogations .
It is not easy for fishermen to take on board a closure of their area for such an extensive period .
We would have preferred to have been informed of this earlier by the Council . They have brought it to us at the very last moment .
For almost a whole generation , a constant earth tremor has been shaking our institutions , and it has swept away the landmarks familiar to the public in our countries and sown doubt over the wisdom of our decisions and of the direction in which we are headed .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , on behalf of my group , I wish to welcome the Commission &apos; s work programme for 2001 .
It saddens me when I hear that my colleague , Mr Barón Crespo , wants to point out here that we must be mainly satisfied to listen to national parliaments .
I know , Mr President , that the Commission is critical - both directly and indirectly - of Parliament &apos;s weaknesses .
First , the initial stage should involve both public debate - I agree with the comments made on this by Mr Swoboda and Mr Brok - and it should involve the planned Laeken declaration .
That is not , of course , what we are doing at present .
First and foremost , we must establish what the most serious shortcomings of the Treaty of Nice are , so that the post @-@ Nice agenda has the right content .
What I should like to know is what role an elected parliament , which must answer for itself , including to its citizens at home , has in relation to associations which have no such responsibility .
The second point : a desire for Europe to be involved in their peace negotiations .
Indeed the Treaty on the European Union , specifically Article 136 , bestows this task on the European Union .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
I shall vote in favour of all the proposals to that end .
We recently saw over 5 000 jobs lost in a single month as the result of takeovers .
As it happens , outside my parliamentary career , I have written books and I use public libraries and research centres .
It will be a matter for local judgment guided by subsidiarity .
Copies are very frequently used for atypical purposes such as exchanges , loans and gifts , and there are many other causes for the uncontrolled proliferation of further copies , which has serious consequences for authors and publishers .
Most of those amendments were , in fact , compromise amendments , also on crucial issues .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the new directive is a huge improvement over the old one , on that we are all agreed .
Today we are discussing the emergency package as a result of BSE and this neither anticipates nor replaces the mid @-@ term review of Agenda 2000 .
If we generally abandon the brake on production in the cereals sector , then we no longer meet the requirements for a bluebox measure .
As far as imports are concerned , it is true to say that we annually import - chiefly from South America at present - around 30 million tonnes of soya and other high @-@ protein feeds .
Is that what you meant ?
The Commission is actively supporting this through different initiatives .
In Sweden , as in any other Member State , or democratic society , caution must be exercised in making a declaration about anyone who has been acquitted of a particular charge that could imply defamation of that person .
This in turn is audited by the personnel of the Food and Veterinary Office who have already visited a number of the Member States to this end since December 2000 , and intend to visit the rest early in 2001 .
The lack of transparency and the improvisation with which my country &apos; s government is acting with regard to the crisis are , in my opinion , the reason for the massive drop in consumption in Spain , for which the cattle farming sector is paying . This is especially the case for my region , Galicia , where cows are an element of social cohesion and , more importantly , are - as a well @-@ known and admired writer says - a totem .
I do not think that we can talk about all of them now , in the time that we have , but I will mention the use of antibiotic @-@ resistant marker genes , the need to respect the Cartagena commitment ( the international agreement ) , the civil responsibility clause , preventing this cultivation from being extended to other plants , the public register of plantations and the localisation of genetically modified organisms and the very serious subject of exports with initial consent and agreement .
We must do what we have to do for the people of Europe and that is to support this piece of legislation tomorrow .
Some important minerals are not covered by the Commission proposal , despite their being used in many EU countries .
Those who have approached me have all pointed out that a number of experts have placed many question marks over those investigations showing that vitamins C , E and A in particular may be dangerous in too high doses , and that alternative investigations seem specifically to show that high doses of these vitamins have had positive effects free from side effects .
Ladies and gentlemen , the internal market does not work .
The forthcoming proposal will be based on additional research into the technical performance and economic viability of equipment that is more advanced with regard to reducing emissions .
To achieve this requires a boarding aid , a lift or a ramp , because a low @-@ floor bus on its own is not enough .
And the common goal in this case is higher employment .
A thorough assessment and evaluation of what these have achieved is to take place : reintegration into working life , activities to promote equality of opportunities , elimination of exclusion , and targeted measures to create a suitable environment for setting up small and medium @-@ sized businesses .
Mr President , regretfully we have learnt that exactly one month after an earthquake devastated El Salvador a similar tremor struck this Central American country again yesterday .
However , there is a wide body of opinion which believes that a democratic state starts and ends with a multi @-@ party system and regular elections .
However , awarding Turkey candidate country status means that Europe now has certain obligations .
Mr President , first I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Swoboda , for an excellent report , and the same goes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , and Common Security and Defence Policy for their realistic presentation of the matter .
If you look at the countries of Eastern and Central Europe and the tremendous pace of reform they have embarked upon and the enormous success they have had , this has only come about because they had membership in their sights .
We still have an employment rate of over 8 % and I would like to draw your attention to a situation which was given short shrift in the debate in the Commission : the fact that we have a youth unemployment rate which is twice as high .
As more people take up employment , the focus on working conditions increases .
This is the right ambition to have and must now be followed up effectively in Stockholm .
The fact is that the Member States accepted monetary union reluctantly , but are not about to sacrifice even more policy freedom in order to achieve the real convergence required .
There is a &apos; dream of the left &apos; and a &apos; dream of the right &apos; , which both seem to be covered by the Lisbon concept .
There is no need to declare this before the vote ; if you agree , we shall proceed in this way .
Discussions with the Commission and the American authorities have shown enthusiasm for the idea , and I hope it is one that the European Parliament , European Commission and US Administration can cooperate on .
Furthermore , we are by no means convinced that GMOs can contribute to agricultural productivity and development ; we are barely even convinced that they can help reduce certain pesticides , as is already being stated in American studies on a large number of areas cultivated with GMOs .
All in all , I am very satisfied with the outcome , and I feel that it will give Europe legislation that strikes a better balance than the much vaunted American legislation .
Basically , a food supplement should be considered to be something that enhances one &apos; s diet and testing should concentrate on the quality of ingredients and manufacture , rather than on what the supplements contain .
This particularly concerns the restructuring of agriculture , raising the profile of the rural environment and environmental protection .
What our group does want to do is pursue the discussion on the potential role of the European Central Bank , also with regard to scrutiny of prudential rules and banking supervision .
the report ( A5 @-@ 0020 / 2001 ) by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the impact of liberalisation and the process of economic reform on the European Union &apos;s economic growth .
The rapporteur mentioned in passing this morning that there were European countries with models of interest .
But do not forget how vital this is to expansion , as the content of the Bullmann report will then be even more crucial .
In other words , the Commission had taken the initiative , Parliament had supported the proposal in a clear vote and the European Council at the highest level , in Tampere one year later , gave legitimacy to this policy direction . Yet , in 2001 , the Council has still not adopted a common position to enable us to continue the procedure .
Mrs Ria , I regret , therefore , your zigzag course . When we look at your proposals , we find they do not tally with what you have said .
I happen to know that the Belgian Presidency is very much prepared to reach political agreement on the content of this dossier and on the timing .
Mr Danielsson said nothing about this .
As the honourable Member rightly points out , the Fourth Motor Insurance Directive does not solve disputes already underway , partly because of the prescribed implementation period .
Mr Nogueira has the floor .
Both are to be presented by the Commission in the next few weeks .
I am very aware that the country holding the presidency does not control the agenda entirely itself . However , initiatives can be taken in the matter of work in progress .
Although Macau is not as rich as Hong Kong , its development in many areas in the last ten years has been extraordinary .
I can report that EU @-@ Macao relations remain extremely good .
The observations and recommendations on democratic transparency in matters as delicate as services , investment , intellectual property and conflict resolution are made out of respect for Parliament , the Mexican people and the Constitution of that country , and are also aimed at preventing any damaging effects on Mexican society .
The NAFTA agreement has played an important role in this .
I should like to reiterate a number of issues that this House and the Council must take clearly into account when making future decisions .
I also agree that these texts have been brought out at just the right time .
I am therefore surprised - I shall not say shocked , which is a very strong word - that Mr Berthu has only found one paragraph on illegal immigration in a Commission communication which seeks to address the issue of legal immigration and that he has not , for example , discovered that the Commission has presented two proposals for framework decisions .
It could be a great help to Europe in safeguarding its cultural identity and democracy if research were carried out on the technical aspects of intellectual property rights .
Needless to say , the Communist Party of Greece will be voting against the report .
I should point out here that the European Commission tried to back up its unacceptable proposal by presenting it when international prices were at their lowest for a decade , in December 1999 .
So there remains Amendment No 2 , which is essentially intended to correct a mistake in the Spanish text .
The debate is closed .
There isn &apos;t a wolf ! &quot;
Since we are in favour of a common asylum policy at EU level , we support the idea of introducing common regulations to combat trafficking in human beings , provided that this does not in any way punish humanitarian initiatives .
( PPE @-@ DE ) , in writing .
In actual fact , the hardline neoliberal programme is being affirmed once again in two major areas .
I believe the government &apos; s new plan is good .
For our part , the European Union has just received the plan and is studying it . It is worth pointing out that this is Belgrade &apos; s first attempt to reach a negotiated settlement through dialogue amongst the various ethnic groups in the territory of the former Yugoslavia .
Religious freedoms in the People &apos;s Republic of China - B5 @-@ 0100 / 01 by Mr Dupuis , Mrs Bonino , Mr Pannella , Mr Turco , Mr Dell &apos;Alba , Mr Cappato and Mr Della Vedova , on behalf of the TDI Group , on freedom of religion in the People &apos;s Republic of China and in the occupied territories ;
Over the last year , we have been able to see , on TV screens throughout the world , the harsh offensive launched by the Chinese régime against the meditation movement Falun Gong since the latter was banned in July 1999 .
The Guinean Government must allow the victims to settle in areas that are further from the fighting and the borders .
We are also urging China quickly and without reservations to ratify the United Nations &apos; International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which we consider to be key factors for improving individual rights .
I am not sure if we should have a collection to pay for his plane ticket , but I believe that , unless the Commission changes its policy , Parliament shall soon be calling for his resignation .
I believe that this is also an important issue since the European Union must strengthen its cooperation and work towards a strategic partnership with India .
While other countries are battling unemployment , Ireland has made exemplary progress in this regard with the creation of new jobs .
I fail to see why Ireland &apos;s transgressions could not have been handled more tactfully , more diplomatically , with more understanding - both by you , Commissioner , and indeed by our somewhat maverick , though genial , finance minister .
In conclusion , the holding of this debate on this occasion is very welcome .
This is absolute political stupidity to say the least .
I can assure you that none of the leaks that have appeared in the press come from my department in the Commission .
I have just learned of the matter through Parliament and I will make sure that I reply when I get back .
It will , however , be a significant advance that can be made without imposing undue pressures on the budget .
Because we cannot be content to copy or imitate blindly any of the national administrations : either we succeed in the ground @-@ breaking experiment of combining the different traditions and cultures to create a single tradition and a single culture , or we will have failed in our task .
This was also the case in 1990 , when your current group President was the President of Parliament .
We are now concerned with the budget amendment before us .
Intervention buying alone would have a budgetary cost of EUR 3 billion .
I regret that the proposal did not come from Mr Fischler and I hope that we will be able to follow that up later when we discuss his 7 @-@ point plan .
For all these reasons , far @-@ reaching measures will be required which will have to be effective in the very long term and on several different levels if it is going to be possible to restore confidence .
Let me explain once again what the supplementary budget will be used for : a proportion , i.e. 33 million , will go towards funding additional BSE tests , a significant share will be used for the buying @-@ in of beef in public stocks , and the majority will be allocated to cover the &apos; purchase for destruction &apos; scheme for cattle .
He also mentioned vaccination as a further possibility .
The Member State in question will be required to do so , and the Commission will have a direct interest in ensuring that was done .
The approach to regulating the market should be geared to the future state of markets in which the conditions will be much more competitive and diversified , with the rapid spread of innovative services , and focused on the implementation of competition law , to replace the ex ante rules applied on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis .
Instead , they will simply prepare drafts , which the Commission will examine within one month and either approve or reject , as appropriate .
The European Greens have a clear attitude towards liberalisation .
That is why I believe that we need to widen the public debate on the action plan that you are outlining , by involving civil societies to a much greater extent in order to reach agreement .
This legislation will ensure a level playing field for operators across the single market .
If it is retained , I think it will be very difficult for us to vote in favour of the report , which would be unfortunate since the report has some very positive aspects for women and is greatly needed given the situation in which the majority of these women find themselves .
As 8 March approaches , we need to get the point across that a person &apos;s achievements count for more than his or her sex .
The Socialist Group has always argued that development policy should be an essential element of the external action of the European Union and its Member States . And this is for two fundamental reasons : firstly , because the underdevelopment in which at least 800 million people live strikes us as intrinsically perverse , socially unjust and economically inefficient .
The underlying idea is that anyone who has no chance of basic education or health care in his own country , has no chance of personal development and therefore of getting a decent start .
How can this be ?
A5 @-@ 0047 / 2001 by Mr Varela Suanzes @-@ Carpegna , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down control measures applicable to fishing for certain stocks of highly migratory fish &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 619 - C5 @-@ 0585 / 2000 - 2000 / 0253 ( CNS ) &#93; ;
The Commission has offered to fund half the cost and that is sufficient .
Members of ICAT , including the EU , have agreed to prohibit the importation of big @-@ eye and blue fin tuna from Equatorial Guinea .
They are perceived to be exacerbating the humanitarian condition of the Iraqi people .
These continued bombings have enabled Saddam to get rid of any international inspection of disarmament measures .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have the impression that the bombing of military targets in Iraq has once again shown the continued extent to which the European Union and in particular , the Council of Ministers have no voice in the matter of foreign and security policy .
They are simply to restrict Saddam Hussein &apos; s ability to kill and terrorise his own people .
I should also like to congratulate the Commission and Mr Patten for keeping faith with his predecessor , Mr Marín . They have shown great loyalty and responsibility - I would term it political responsibility - in being true to the outline of the initiative launched by him .
However our legal advisers tell me that the exact articles for the legal base could only be determined at the end of the negotiations .
Unfortunately , however , it appears that a stricter attitude may be needed , since illegal immigrants living in several European countries originate from Romania .
It is high time that we abandon a form of agricultural production which simply aims for the highest possible yield and does not take sufficient account of quality and the interests of consumers .
Gallagher report ( A5 @-@ 0044 / 2001 )
That is now the time when we deal with points of order .
I think that we should respond to three requirements which advocate including this issue on the agenda for this part @-@ session .
Mr Barón Crespo wrote to me to request that an exhaustive document be drawn up listing all the requests to waive parliamentary immunity and detailing the reactions given to them .
Despite many differences , I can say that Basque nationalists have tried to follow the Irish model .
The main issues surrounding the transport of radioactive materials , such as transparency , safety and , more importantly , ways of reducing these transports , have been curtailed in the report that was presented to you .
It is actually a far more innocent exercise involving the temporary transportation of files between members of the Commission out of concern to lend a hand from time to time . I must specify that I shall not be stockpiling these files .
Now , two observations .
The third point I would like to make is as follows : you met Mr Bob Soellig in the United States . I gather from the press that the mood of the meeting was very good , which is not surprising given that you are old friends , so in that sense I hope we can look forward to a rosier future in transatlantic relations .
Thirdly , and this answers Mr Herzog and Mrs Fiebiger , we are fully aware of the effects upon government policy of negotiations on services and we therefore agree absolutely with your recommendation as to the special nature of public service provision .
It responds to the needs of all sides , while remaining within the bounds of the possibilities and balances offered by the common agricultural policy .
In most sugar @-@ producing Member States , the entire national quota is in the hands of only two companies .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Is it reasonable that copies of the Official Journal of the EC which are more than three months old should have to be paid for ?
Yet the same Council gave the Commission a mandate to propose to the next Council in May 2001 a mechanism affording protection against unfair competition from Korean shipyards .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
People who escape poverty , misery or war cannot be blamed for their actions .
Furthermore , with regard to this one , I have certain particular concerns which have been expressed here : the increased responsibility for control on the part of private individuals , and the serious and real problem of refugees .
Mr President , the European Commission has done a good job .
That is how matters stand , however .
They should not be mutually exclusive .
The proposals with which we are dealing today and those with which we dealt previously are largely about closing this area of freedom , democracy and justice , which might be said already to be in the process of becoming isolated .
Less than a month after the tragedy of the East Sea that ran aground on the French coast , with 908 people crammed into the holds of an old tub , including three babies born during the crossing , we run the risk of perpetuating the image of a Europe that is suspicious of foreigners and wants , above all , to strengthen its borders , while alleging that the intention is to combat the trafficking in human beings .
It would operate in a similar way to the way in which the Lisbon Drug Monitoring Centre operates , albeit in a different sector , which monitors changes in drug distribution from their origin . The objective is therefore to be able to study criminal phenomena right from their origins , monitoring the enormous capacity for evolution and veritable metamorphosis of crime to adapt to new forms of prevention , apart from anything else , and thus find new channels for expression .
Before proceeding to the vote on the draft legislative resolution , I give the floor to Mrs Terrón i Cusí for a point of order .
I do not support this report which far from being sweet , leaves a rather bitter taste .
It needs to be strengthened because refugees face more than just state persecution and because very often it is not just individuals who are targeted but whole families .
The European Parliament is sending out a clear message , which offers a coherent vision of the future of the WTO .
On more than one occasion , concluding a discussion was delayed due to the pressure brought to bear by some Heads of State and Government , which was considerable pressure , but pointless and , above all , harmful .
. ( FR ) I shall gladly accept your invitation , as , believe me , before I made any decisions with regard to this matter , I visited some small clubs and training centres .
These broad principles must be put into practice when applying the new rules of world football .
By way of conclusion , I must confess that it makes me feel somewhat uneasy that we keep having to consider initiatives from Member States here .
I would particularly like to thank Mr Bösch for his report and I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation across party lines in this highly important area .
All the parliamentary groups are united in wishing to recover the money and improve administrative checks . We do feel we are making progress in the fight against fraud .
It takes as its starting point the Commission &apos;s Annual Report on protecting the Communities &apos; financial interests and the fight against fraud , which the Commission presented on 13 November 2000 and which also contains statistics on cases of irregularities and fraud reported by the Member States , as they are obliged to do .
The citizens need to be informed and the Commission must make a particular point of doing so in areas where subsidiarity applies . That will enable the citizens to defend their own rights and insist that their governments take the necessary action .
As this directive applies to all documents in the environment area , in many cases the files might be in storage off @-@ site and perhaps not computerised .
For the four Member States I mentioned , where these premiums were made available , the total expenditure amounted to EUR 326.6 million , of which 235.4 million went to the United Kingdom .
It is not the business of the Commission to regulate prices - price control is a thing of the past .
Are both sides equally to blame ?
I do not believe it would be wise for the Commission to provide the applicant States with money for their own public @-@ relations activities .
There are , of course , other projects that I do not have time to mention , which have , in general , also been undertaken with concession contracts .
The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 0068 / 2001 ) from Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , concerning the common position of the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council regulation on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants &#91; COM ( 2000 ) - C5 @-@ 0562 / 2000 - 1998 / 0225 ( COD ) &#93; .
Mr President , all large combustion plants together account for 63 % of the sulphur dioxide and 21 % of the nitrogen oxide emissions in the European Union .
It is technically feasible but will require the installation of costly end @-@ of @-@ pipe controls .
In this connection , I would also remind you that - to begin with , at least - the Commission refused to sign the Gothenburg Protocol because it thought it was so inadequate and not ambitious enough .
For that reason , Mrs Jackson &apos; s question is more than justified .
But there was never an opportunity to have a serious discussion between the Council and Parliament about the best means of achieving what should have been shared objectives .
The next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 0054 / 01 ) by Mr Wijkman , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , on the communication from the Commission to the Council &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 247 - C5 @-@ 0567 / 2000 / 2265 ( COS ) &#93; , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Action Plan to Improve Energy Efficiency in the European Community .
Energy efficiency is not just about installing more efficient technology .
Thank you , Mrs Stihler .
We must translate the challenges of the public debate into concrete proposals for the revision of the Treaties .
Finally , without anticipating the future too much , my own group feels sufficiently strongly about this participation that if Parliament was inappropriately excluded or diminished in its institutional role we would consider recommending that it should not give any opinion on an Intergovernmental Conference .
Madam President , Commissioner Barnier &apos; s speech has confirmed how close the positions of the Commission and Parliament are .
Lastly , Madam President , neither the Council nor the presidency itself must use the debate as an excuse to do nothing .
Post @-@ Nice is thus not a normal follow @-@ up of Nice , but a harsh necessity to rectify what has gone wrong as soon as possible .
Therefore , I think it is important that this also be included as part of the on @-@ going discussion .
I would also like to state that President Putin of Russia will visit Stockholm in connection with the summit on 23 March for an informal working lunch with the Heads of State and Heads of Government of the EU .
Madam President , Minister , ladies and gentlemen , I said just now that pensions and social protection systems are essentially national responsibilities and that it is for the Member States to bring about the necessary reforms .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioner , representatives of the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , in making an assessment of the observable results during the first year of implementation of the Lisbon agreements , we reach very limited conclusions .
Swedish universities are in crisis .
I am glad to see the Scots getting one hundred percent .
Access to information is the very least our citizens deserve and we in the European Parliament must act so that this access is promoted and not denied .
. I congratulate my Socialist colleague Mr Bosch for his report which pushes for stronger measures to step up the fight against fraud and makes the zero tolerance principle a reality .
Mr President , at least the European Union surpassed itself at the Lisbon Summit .
All three concepts are interconnected .
The Commission is also preparing a communication on conflict prevention which we will present to the Council in April .
Finally , of course , accountability .
Mr President , when it comes to conflict prevention and crisis management , the leaders of most Member States and the European Union itself have not chalked up any successes , nor are they able to give many guarantees for the future .
Without such tools of anticipation , which Mrs Lindh spoke of earlier , though she did not actually talk about tools , we manage crises , but we do not see them coming .
There can therefore be no question at all of the Commission &apos;s right of initiative being affected by any such advice .
It is not the European Parliament that is slowing things down .
The disease is out of control in Britain and has now spread to continental Europe .
The United States and Canada have just closed their borders , placing our farmers in a very difficult situation . This scourge affects pig farmers and cattle producers , who have already been greatly weakened by BSE and other diseases .
Intensive farming is another issue that was raised .
Debates can be followed live not only on TV , but via the Internet too .
What are the criteria for the morality of candidates who will have to occupy this post ?
Certainly , the Commission would like to see the pension fund directive become a reality as soon as possible .
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 0082 / 2001 ) by Mr von Wogau , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , on the state of the European economy , report preparatory to the Commission recommendation on the broad economic policy guidelines &#91; 2001 / 2008 ( INI ) &#93; .
We must therefore continue to ensure that priority European objectives - promoting small and medium @-@ sized businesses , cutting red tape , reducing overly high tax rates - are implemented consistently .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Based upon my experiences there , I would like to make a few points in the context of the Fava report and the Commission communication , both of which I warmly welcome .
Ukraine has not found the transition to a market economy an easy process .
This is a huge problem , which is why we need a new concept .
We worked very closely together and I hope he feels that our committee added value to his own efforts .
At present the most important international forum , which has the powers and scope to begin discussions on these questions , is the ICANN Governmental Advisory Committee ( GAC ) , which is an intergovernmental organisation .
At the Assembly in Brussels we took the first steps towards realigning the Assembly to fit the Cotonou Agreement .
Does the European Commission find it acceptable that a landslide could dislocate the operation of the Itoiz dam and threaten the Ascó nuclear power station ?
Furthermore , when managing their water resources , our neighbours may adopt measures that affect Portuguese interests , but there is nothing that we , on the other hand , can do in terms of our water resources that would directly affect Spanish interests .
This also applies to the situation in the developing countries .
Leaving it to the sector leads to an entanglement of ethics and economic interests .
The third point , which will bring me to my conclusion , is that I believe fundamental decisions , particularly on releasing GMOs , must continue to come under political responsibility .
I agree with you wholeheartedly , Mr Barón Crespo .
We must make full use of Europe &apos;s older workers , increase gender equality across the labour market , and encourage women to become entrepreneurs .
Madam President , you will not believe this but , the day before yesterday , I met a group of young Ukrainians who , when they heard that I often talk about the problems of pensioners , almost begged me , with one voice : &apos; did you know that in the Ukraine pensioners are really , really badly off ?
It demands that Member States encourage private industry to penetrate further into universities and public institutions .
What could be more normal , in the face of a catastrophe which everyone agrees is a humanitarian , health , demographic , economic and social catastrophe , than to want to do everything to save one &apos; s own people .
I come from a different cultural and religious tradition to those who created the Bamiyan Buddha statues in the 2nd century , but I feel that all of us share a common ownership of our heritage and the right to free movement , education and employment regardless of gender .
This criticism cannot be levelled at the European Parliament which has taken action several times over , the last occasion being on 30 November 2000 , when it condemned the regime as forcefully as it could and set alarm bells ringing regarding the tragic humanitarian situation experienced by the entire population .
There was a reminder of resoluteness and there was a reminder of values , because if we want to safeguard the interests of the people of Zimbabwe , we must continue to get our position across to everyone , including the authorities .
There is no need to look any further than the reports by Amnesty International , which detail the extrajudicial executions , the systematic use of torture , the murder of civilians and the destruction of villages all suffered in Cabinda .
Additionally , the proper implementation of European @-@ funded TACIS projects is being frustrated by poor management and by a lack of adequate information and sound financial accountability .
Mr President , the EU is committed to combating the destabilising accumulations of small arms in many parts of the world .
Commissioner , as far as this matter is concerned , you could make many people a lot happier this afternoon .
I think that should really always be settled at the start of the period .
As our President , Nicole Fontaine , stressed at the time that the matter of the assistants had made significant and concrete headway and that the transitory measures which had been adopted reflected the will and determination of the European Parliament to move towards greater transparency and fairness in this area ..
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned .
However , if you want to give Serb and Yugoslav democratic powers a chance , allow them to bravely take on their responsibility and see things through to the end .
It was supposed to have made it possible for a firm or a company complying with its own home rules to have a passport to trade anywhere across the European Union .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
Whether it be this issue or the environment or the application of the precautionary principle , we must have the democratic freedom to be able to insist on some minimum standards acceptable to the majority of our citizens .
Such a ban would prevent producers in non @-@ EU countries from obtaining market advantages by being able to continue making use of animal experiments .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in Germany there is an old proverb which says that you have to suffer to be beautiful .
I am absolutely certain that genuinely sustainable development cannot be implemented without dialogue and cooperation with industry .
Landfilling is a ticking time @-@ bomb due to the release of hazardous PVC additives and the potential for dioxin formation during landfill fires .
In the European Union alone , 21,000 small and medium @-@ sized companies are affected .
Because of its long lifespan PVC certainly presents advantages in some products , but these are reduced by the stabilisers used .
If we can make progress in improving the returns for pensioners in private schemes across the European Union , we should do so .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
That is why we are concerned .
My second point relates to energy .
Commission reform and making administration more efficient are key objectives .
Furthermore , parties organised at European level will only widen the chasm between the citizen and European politics .
My group particularly welcomes the reference to the assistance statute and the funding for political parties .
To achieve this , we therefore need access to finance , particularly for micro @-@ companies .
Financial aid for meeting these objectives is available from several EU programmes , and this should be made more visible to the public , so that it is clear to them what their money is being spent on at EU level .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
Why have we not yet arranged for a secure archive to be set up to which Members may come to read confidential documents under proper conditions ?
Then the ECSC will still have amounts outstanding on credits it granted , but the money it borrowed itself should have been paid off .
It is unjustifiable in the twenty @-@ first century that we are using such prehistoric practices .
The implications for agriculture or for the Structural Funds have not yet been determined , but will become clear in time .
The decisions concerned were made by the previous Commission between 1991 and 1994 .
There were other problems with IRELA , flax and Fléchard , too , and all we have to do in this House is look at our previous reports .
As far as my group is concerned , you herewith comply with the conditions contained in Paragraph 8 , I d ) of the Blak resolution , and I can inform you , on behalf of my group , that we will be granting you discharge .
In the discharge , Denmark was subject to a critical comment which is a scathing criticism of the way in which the Danish Ministry of Food , Agriculture and Fisheries handles export aid payments .
I want to warn against that because we in the Committee on Budgetary Control used to see ourselves as working with the Commission for the improvement of the management of our resources .
Over the following weeks , however , the number of cases rose exponentially with daily totals sometimes 50 or more in number .
In the Netherlands , twelve cases in a limited area have now led to the slaughter of almost 100 000 animals .
And how can we cut our numbers of farmers and livestock ?
However , I am left with some questions about the effectiveness of the controls up to the point of the outbreak of the first disease .
It is quite inexplicable that animals in zoos and at pasture in nature reserves are not allowed to be vaccinated .
Finally , what is the SVC &apos;s opinion of the various methods of disposal used in the UK where a million animals have now been culled ?
Every company , consumer and authority must adapt to this new situation , and the communication being presented today consists of a report on the situation with regard to the preparations for the introduction of coins and notes , but also , as well as assessing the general situation , additional work is being carried out : on the one hand , to establish to what extent the content of the Commission recommendation of last 11 October has been complied with by the Member States and , secondly , to establish a series of good practices , the application of which may contribute to aiding the correct development of operations relating to the introduction of notes and coins .
So my question is : How do you intend to provide information in these countries ?
The same , of course , applies to parallel imports , since the agreement leaves this open to WTO members to decide what can or cannot be done .
If so , this would be a change for the worse for Swedish citizens .
But I want to go further .
The issue of access should also be extended to education .
Mr President , have you seen how we all agree on this issue ?
The probability of contracting this disease increases from year to year .
As we all know , Article 152 gives public health greater importance than ever before , so that health has to be taken into consideration in all European Union policy areas .
I repeat my appreciation for all the constructive work that the rapporteur and the committee have put in .
Well then , in my opinion , the articles of the Treaty should be sufficient to prevent a State company operating a monopoly from taking over a company on the liberalised market . This would be abuse of a dominant position , State aid .
This means that the Member States no longer have any reason to hesitate .
I congratulate him on this agreement .
I am not asking you to kick him out of the Commission , just to take this portfolio away from him and appoint someone else who will pay genuine attention to these issues and who will , at last , do something about the question of Chechnya .
It is not yet too late as the Swedish Presidency still has a few months left to run .
I am not seeking an answer in terms of domestic policy but a theoretical opinion from an EU perspective .
It seems to us essential that the conclusions that you adopted regarding better coordination between the Luxembourg process , the social agenda , the Lisbon process and the broad guidelines of economic policy should enable this spring Council to rediscover , or discover , its true role , that of defining policy on the basis of the preparatory work carried out by the Commission , which enables everybody to play their part , the Commission in its role as instigator , and the European Council in its role as policy maker .
This is a subject which requires a great deal of thought for , all too often , we confuse the two things : we believe , that is , that globalisation , the fact that we are opening up our economies , will automatically lead to a less equitable , wider disparity in the distribution of wealth .
( With successive votes Parliament adopted the decisions and the resolution )
I do not share his view on this .
As for the liberalisation of air space , we are still wrangling over how to deal with Gibraltar airport , meaning that umpteen thousand tourists will again be left sitting in airports this summer due to delayed flights .
I am grateful that a few Member States are now pressing in the Council for uniform border controls on the external borders of the European Union .
I shall , therefore , not be referring to the scoreboard &apos; s content , but I do wish to begin by referring to an issue raised by Mr Posselt ; that of drafting an annual budget on progress made in consolidating the area of freedom , security and justice .
In order to improve efficiency , is the Council thinking of assessing the use of resources from this fund ?
I share the view of the Commission and the presidency that the current deficiencies in the field of asylum and refugees are linked to the problem that we have no common policy .
Where this is concerned I want to make a clear distinction between human trafficking which exploits vulnerable people and what we call humanitarian acts .
The Regulation is therefore of crucial economic significance for the least developed countries .
What does the future hold for these countries , if they cannot achieve a level of development which will enable them to make choices that are truly independent ?
Question Time ( Council )
So I shall simply take this opportunity to say to Mr Dupuis , in connection with the previous question , you should show some respect , you really should .
I would simply like to remind the honourable Member that the decision on Agenda 2000 in March 1999 also includes what is known as a mid @-@ term review of the Common Agricultural Policy that is to be implemented in 2002 and 2003 .
History has shown the danger of such a development .
The next item is the report ( A5 @-@ 0093 / 2001 ) by Mrs Marieke Sanders @-@ ten Holte , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 340 - C5 @-@ 0294 / 2000 - 2000 / 0145 ( COD ) &#93; amending Regulation No 2027 / 97 on air carrier liability in the event of accidents .
We are debating the liability in this respect and the provision of information to the consumer .
In this connection , simply granting terminals for combined transport exemption from notification is not a reasonable measure to take .
This proposal for a Regulation concerning state aid for the inland transport sector implements Article 73 of the Treaty , according to which aids for the coordination of transport are compatible with Community law .
It has taken several readings and a conciliation procedure , but all &apos; s well that ends well .
New professions are being used , or rather abused and involved in all cases .
If it affects Internet banking , as they suggest , then there must be other ways that they can verify the credentials of people who are applying for accounts .
The Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs would have liked a more comprehensive and ambitious programme from the Commission .
We are counting on constructive dialogue with , and the support of , the European Parliament to make this operation a success .
This question was examined and settled by my services , after the Council had engaged the Commission to do so in December and within the framework of the Nice Summit .
Preserving what has been acquired , preventing what is undesirable and remaining receptive to what is new - that is the basis for a constitution for a federation of nation states and that is what I should like to talk about .
This morning you have made a substantial contribution to this debate .
If you do not have access to this letter , we shall , of course , put the matter right .
And you are of the same political group as the President of Parliament and the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
But the third came with the thumbprint of Government on it , unlike this request , so it is an inadequate precedent , even if it is a modest step in that direction .
As Mr Howitt mentioned , thematic cooperation must include education and the fight against poverty .
We have heard a lot today and we will rightly hear a lot more about one of the biggest challenges , Aids : two days ago , Kofi Annan was appealing to the world to play a bigger part in this .
It is a case concerning a traffic violation , as the second to last paragraph on page 10 of my report says , &quot; the charge against Mrs Jeggle relates to the offence of dangerous driving since it is alleged that when driving her car on 4 May 1999 she acted recklessly and in gross violation of road traffic regulations by overtaking another vehicle at a point that did not afford sufficient visibility to do so . &quot;
When to this we add the fact that the Treaty of Amsterdam guarantees the right - in its broadest possible sense - to have access to documents of the Union institutions , we could say that the existing basic framework is quite demanding .
I am all the more pleased , because the liberal group has been closely involved in the negotiation process : firstly by tabling a number of amendments , also in the later stages , in order to keep the pressure on ; secondly by supplying no less than three draftsmen of opinions and thirdly , as already mentioned , by the commitment of the liberal Committee Chairman , Mr Watson , in the final and deciding stage .
This proposal constitutes a clear improvement when it comes to transparency and , in addition , to democratic administration within the EU .
I share the opinion of our rapporteur , Mr Cashman , who is to be congratulated . He says that this is something that will develop by itself .
Transparency is an advantage , not only for democracy but also for the authorities to which it extends .
We do not always observe them all , but these values include a high level of tolerance , a high level of respect for others and a great commitment to protecting minorities .
It is precisely this assistance , as rapporteur Swoboda pointed out with good reason , which benefits the stabilisation and association process in the entire region of the western Balkans .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
That is the finding in a report by the Otto @-@ Hug @-@ Institut at Munich University .
Nuclear power is no solution .
The functional link of this body should be solely with the European institutions and under no circumstances with a national institution .
The proposal is based upon a highly developed method of analysis applied by certain laboratories .
Dagmar Roth @-@ Behrendt intended to move one of the two amendments tonight .
However , as I come from a small region with small farms that have huge problems , and where there have been some , but very few , cases of BSE , I would like to highlight three issues that I think are fundamental .
Similarly , the capacity to record the name and address of the animal owner would assist in combating trafficking in pet animals , and clarification of the anti @-@ rabies vaccine is included in the report as well as the OIE International Animal Health Code again for the purposes of effectiveness of the proposal .
There is unanimous agreement on the safety of the technical provisions relating to the management of the rabies risk , even if a few points of disagreement remain and may need some further clarification .
( The sitting was closed at 11.10 p.m. )
For this reason , we consider that certain parts of the report we are debating today are particularly apposite .
It has put additional wind into the sails of the opponents of EMU in the countries outside the euro zone .
We in the Commission do believe it is important for Parliament to have access to as much information as possible .
Privacy is a different concept ; it means that communications really are secure , which is why I should like to stress again that privacy should be the real objective , i.e. really guaranteeing that communications are secure .
It is intended as a first step towards establishing an accounting regime across Europe which meets the requirement of a modern global market place and which , in particular , will provide those who read company accounts with the kind of information they will want and should be entitled to know .
Amendment 2 would make it more difficult to establish a clear epidemiological picture of the incidence of BSE in contradiction to Parliament &apos;s resolution of last November .
I believe he is also right to say that the institutions need &apos; space to think &apos; and therefore some informal documents should be excluded from his proposal in order to allow the free exchange of ideas .
This would clearly be a definitive operation .
In the final analysis , our message should be that this 3 % should not be used up - which might well be the case - and that our objective is still to achieve a surplus .
Madam President , I have a point of order concerning the death penalty in the United States .
An extraordinarily important and pioneering provision .
There is at least one commitment in this direction for the future .
In this way , the addiction of future generations of young people has been taken seriously , and a framework created to reduce the enormous harm caused by this product .
I saw her last week in Berlin and I am sure she is making a rapid recovery and would wish all to know that her heart remains in our proceedings in these matters of food hygiene and food safety .
It was possible after all to further improve the text of the recommendation .

We must therefore also aim for optimum use of government investment in the use of technology .
We need the directives , we need ambitious objectives , we need measures , we need action programmes , with their own funding , of course , and if we do all that in education , then we shall not need so many Commission and Parliament information campaigns any more because we shall have reached the citizen where he is .
I also often feel the lack of links to the concept of lifelong learning in a number of the reports .
We feel that the open coordination method proposed in Lisbon will help to promote the numerous new ideas needed in Europe in order to improve education and flexibly promote best practices .
We must also train our teachers .
Public acceptance of the euro and of European economic policy , Mr von Wogau , will not simply depend on the coining of a new term such as &apos; home market &apos; or the like .
Would public finances thus be unsustainable , because they are short @-@ lived ?
That is essential too .
For this reason , the Commission &apos; s proposed target is surely a reasonable starting point .
Only if manufacturers themselves are saddled with the extra costs for re @-@ use and recycling will they gain the financial incentive to design their electrical and electronic products in such a way as to ensure that they can be re @-@ used more easily and in a more environmentally @-@ friendly manner .
I assume that I can count on the support of this Chamber for that too .
We are tackling the specific problem of electrical and electronic waste for the following reasons .
The original Commission proposal was barely in line .
The Commission clearly has certain grounds for assuming , Commissioner , that these may belong to the category of priority hazardous substances .
( Parliament accepted the oral amendment )
Under the Amsterdam Treaty , the European Parliament does have the power of co @-@ decision in the field of consumer protection and public health matters .
This offers educational opportunities and encourages people to take on active role in society across Europe .
Mauro report ( A5 @-@ 0152 / 2001 )
Kinghorn primary school in Fife thought that the research issue was important and that an e @-@ mail network of pupils allowing them to discuss and explore the issues was critical .
This could then include the possibility of using warning labels , as is done in the United States , for example , at least as long as it can be proven that these warning labels serve a purpose .
I personally would like to see alcohol advertising banned at young people &apos;s sporting events , not at adult events but at young people &apos;s sporting events , and I believe very strongly that we should support this recommendation .
We need to make it crystal clear that we shall also be able to take out of the market , not just for us , but world @-@ wide , those products which present a serious risk , not just for domestic consumption , but also in the global market , because such products can easily be recycled , as Mrs González Álvarez says in her new Amendment No 13 .
. ( FR ) Mr President , the financial implications of the emergency plan proposed by the Commission to deal with the upheavals in the beef market as a result of the BSE crisis , have now been referred to the Committee on Budgets .
We are insisting once again on applying the &apos; one size fits all &apos; approach , as if all farms had the same capacity to adapt and to survive .
So I think the long @-@ term solution is to take on board Robert Sturdy &apos;s report .
Salvador de Madariaga said that man is the only tree which picks up its roots and walks .
. ( IT ) To answer your question , just a short while ago , I said that we have to set ourselves a goal of energy taxation which regulates energy consumption itself , not just by ensuring that the share of rail transport does not fall below its 1998 level and thus succeeding , by means of practical decisions , in achieving those goals which you , Mr Modrow , say we have failed to achieve , but also by setting ourselves the goal of alternative fuels , including biofuels , accounting for at least 7 % of total fuel consumption by 2010 .
Labelling schemes which are objective , which are transparent and which are non @-@ discriminatory can promote exactly the sort of higher labour standards that the honourable Member supports and that I support as well .
The problem of the exchange rate has given rise to much discussion and debate , given that the exchange rate cannot be modified , being irrevocable , and given that the problem in Ireland would be resolved by a modification of the exchange rate .
This is intended to create an incentive to fish with larger @-@ mesh , more selective nets .
Progress has been made in this sector since 1996 , now that primary expenditure in the wider public sector has been legalised and rationalised and is better controlled , but I have to say that there are problems with the information received by the European Union , due mainly to the lack of detailed information , particularly from certain funds .
Conservation of stocks and sustainable management were the deciding factors in setting the quotas .
What we want , and it should not be necessary to have to say this once again , is sustainable development and the preservation of fish stocks .
There is perhaps a legitimate fear that , via triangular operations , more goods - such as sugar for example - could enter the European Union than these countries produce .
I emphatically support the rapporteur &apos; s call for a study of the actual implications of the initiative .
During this time the European Parliament has been working on a proposal made to us by the Commission , called the Erika I package , containing two or three important reports .
That is a step forward , as is banning single @-@ hulled tankers and refusing access to ships from states sailing under a so @-@ called &apos; flag of convenience &apos; .
What the Commission regrets most of all is that we have been so close to reaching one : only a tiny bit more was needed .
All drivers have a right to be employed in accordance with the conditions that usually apply in the Member States .
We have witnessed a number of personal attacks on the leader of a political grouping , attacks based on information given in newspaper articles , none of which has been proved to be true .
We have noted the steps taken by the Palestinian authority to adopt an austerity budget .
We have been saying for too long that we must stop the cycle of violence .
There have been many debates but few resolutions , and Parliament is realising that resolutions and declarations have to have value and meaning .
Mr Sharon must acknowledge his political responsibility .
It is an ambitious goal .
Yet we have to admit that the Bush Administration &apos; s first decisions have a more serious impact than anything we have ever seen so far .
That is all the more regrettable since our trade disputes could have been effectively prevented by the &quot; early warning &quot; system within the TABD and the Legislators Dialogue .
With regard to the Technical Group of Independent Members , I would like to make it quite clear to the House that these two blocks of amendments were tabled by the seven radical members of the group .
As a British member I was very concerned when the proposed directive was first discussed in the Environment Committee that it would inflict severe financial and bureaucratic damage on the flourishing British and Irish charity shop industry - largely unknown elsewhere in the EU - which raises so much money for good causes , and is also extremely sound environmentally by recycling and reusing large quantities of second @-@ hand goods , which it then makes available cheaply to the consumer in its retail outlets .
A certain complacency has arisen in this field , similar to that found in transport by sea .
Isn &apos;t BSE a good thing !
( IT ) Mr President , as usual , Mr Poettering had a wry smile on his lips when he came into the Hemicycle .
But the point with the monitoring system , with Article 16 and with the system of a judge to oversee how sentences are executed in Turkey is , how is all this going to be implemented ?
It would be possible to induce certain people to stop what they are doing if Turkey showed willing on the three points listed by Daniel Cohn @-@ Bendit .
The agreement makes it quite clear that Macedonia has European prospects .
If we want to avoid civil war , someone has to gainsay this philosophy of armed struggle , but not , of course , the government of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , because if it undertakes to disarm the KLA , there will definitely be civil war .
I must say that democracy does not consist of those parties that have a majority gaining material advantages over the opposition and , furthermore , of assuming the right to deny the opposition these advantages for ideological reasons of their own .
Moreover , innovative projects on the ground can be funded by the European Social Fund and by the new EQUAL initiative .
Mr President , on behalf of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I would also thank the rapporteur , Mr Cercas , for his work on the Commission &apos; s communication , which I consider to be really sound and very informative .
This should already have been done under the Stability Pact since , like employment , social protection is conditioned by macroeconomic policy decisions and by the increased dependence of the elderly and the unforeseeable increase in changes in the labour market , with periods of training alternating with periods of activity and inactivity .
Can we be absolutely sure about what will happen in the future ?
I would ask you please to reply to my question and I hope the reply will be in the affirmative . Will the Council review this decision in the near future , having first consulted the Colombian authorities and Colombian society ?
Clearly , debates must go ahead , regardless of who the protesters may be and of the legitimacy or otherwise of their cause . The Council is not going to be responsible for security in all three premises used by Parliament .
Measures for 2002 must be taken in the light of the current discussion concerning a recovery plan for hake .
According to the Commission &apos; s proposal , the Council will have to submit formal points of view regarding certain details of the agreement in principle with the United States .
The conditions were not right for a thorough reform and so we have chosen to bring forward the introduction of some important rules allowing this sector to face the new challenges posed by the World Trade Organisation , the liberalisation of the markets and the reform of the common agricultural policy .
After highly constructive talks with the Member States , these improvements were set out in Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 648 / 2000 .
Mr Hoon has even said that there is no concept of a European rapid reaction force as such .
That sounds solid enough .
To those honourable Members who have been seriously concerned about the margin of category 5 , I can say by way of reassurance that that this afternoon &apos; s vote on the schedule of part @-@ sessions for next year at any rate turned out very favourably financially .
It is my deep conviction that , in a not too distant future , it will become one of the official languages of the European Union .
But the process must continue and the system must remain open .
Madam President , I do not wish to repeat all that I have just said .
I should also , however , like to thank the Commission , in particular Commissioner Barnier and the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , for responding to the initiative taken by the four aforementioned groups in this Parliament and tabling this proposal .
I should like to ask Messrs Poettering and Barón Crespo to reconsider their words .
I agree , however , with some of the critics who say that the proposal in front of us will not provide a lasting statute for the development of campaigning political parties , which are an essential factor should our vibrant transnational European parliamentary democracy flourish .
In its proposal the Commission tried to adhere to two principles .
This is one of the ideas which our proposals contain .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the initiatives adopted within the framework of the creation of a European area of freedom , security and justice have made this major political objective of the Union one of the most dynamic vectors for the broadening and deepening of European integration .
All in all , we are not nearly as nasty as people say we are .
I am convinced , as Mr Maaten said in the report he described for us when he spoke on behalf of the Liberal Group , that Europe is also and most of all constructed through the European political parties .
The European Parliamentary Labour Party supports the proposal to lay down clear and transparent guidelines for the operation of European political parties and to regulate their finances .
It should be remembered that justice is a right bestowed and organised by national governments .
For more than a hundred years , social democracy has fought for a redistributive welfare state based on solidarity . Now it is at the forefront of the campaign to dismantle it .
As and when possible , they must provide the vital oxygen for this pilot light of the Algerian freedom of press , not least during the negotiations involving the country &apos; s authorities .
Since 1996 , the Commission has committed EUR 300 million from its MEDA budget lines and under the financial protocols to support economic and social reform in Algeria .
There must be conditionality across the board : not only in our assistance to Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina but also to Serbia or Yugoslavia . We made this quite clear in the case of Croatia .
Without wanting to let the Cameroon leaders off the hook , I would , by the by , like to draw your attention to one of the fundamental problems of Cameroon and , in fact , of large parts of Africa , namely the dramatic slump in the price of raw materials .
In fact , we should also be aware that this phenomenon not only occurs in Italy , of course .
That is a situation which simply cannot be tolerated .
Thousands of people have been evacuated , often having lost everything .
( DE ) Mr President , first may I say that I am delighted at this decision although , in this case , I am the one to suffer from this decision .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen .
The Nice European Council stipulated that this directive should be revised , and I quote , &apos; by 2002 &apos; , which would require setting the procedure in motion immediately .
If we implement the directive suddenly , we risk putting all gas operations solely in the hands of huge multinational groups , and thereby seeing the conditions of public service deteriorate .
The specific programmes are the instruments for implementation .
You are aware that we have the Marie Curie programme , which is a success , but we would like to double the resources in the proposals allocated to assisting the mobility of young researchers , and also to create grants to attract researchers to Europe , so that Europe once again becomes an attractive option for the best researchers in the world including third countries .
I wonder if he would listen in particular to those people who are working in the field of public health and their concerns that what has been a very good programme on public health care , health promotion and illness prevention seems to be disappearing .
The truth , however , is that the governments , which control the agenda at an Intergovernmental Conference , took a different decision and the agenda was , therefore , not the one the European Parliament wanted .
What is of interest is what the fundamental rules contain , not what we decide to call them .
There has been no significant extension of majority decision @-@ making in the Council .
I and my group , too , are deeply worried about the future of the European Union , because many of the questions affecting people &apos; s everyday concerns and needs have still not been resolved or are addressed only half @-@ heartedly .
For the governments to absent themselves would leave us with a grandiose talking shop , it would be insufferable for this Parliament to be fobbed off in this way .
Hence Parliament &apos;s demand for a convention of the Council , not just a forum .
Some new inspiration , some groundswell , must reinvigorate the old method of intergovernmental negotiation .
Power on the one hand , democracy on the other .
The small extension now being made in Article 113 , Services and Intellectual Property , is counteracted by six exceptions and three proposals to the Council itself not to go beyond the spheres assigned to it .
Another aspect of this visit that worries me is the relationship with the United States , which has a dominant position in that region and responsibilities far greater than Europe &apos; s .
We need yardsticks that are valid for all the EU and we can conceive of them only for the EU .
It is found here in items 21 and 22 of this report . It concerns the removal of environmentally harmful subsidies , especially on coal .
Let us ensure that we can put these issues into practice .
The second is the promotion of citizen participation .
I can support many objectives , but these can only be obtained once the objectives of the fifth Environment Action Programme have been met .
In that way , various parties can join forces and can turn the sixth environment action programme into a success .
Some significant improvements have been made from the common position to the final directive , some have entered the directive , such as the introduction of monitoring or the strengthening of provisions on the quality of the environmental report .
The Court of Auditors , however , is not a legislative body ; we are all very fond of the Court of Auditors , but we are not here to act as messenger boys , we are here to legislate .
Another extremely important point concerns delays in payments .
( SV ) Mr President , it is an unexpected but welcome honour to be able to speak to you here this evening .
The proposed directive therefore eliminates the exceptions which appeared in the original directive , since they were conceived of in different circumstances and allowed the use of adult safety belts in the absence of a child restraint system .
We sometimes think that we are in the vanguard , but the truth is far from that and a great deal still needs to change .
I hope that this proposed amendment will be widely supported by this House .
I work actively to ensure that women and men have equal opportunities in every area of society .
First , the European Union has proposed a combination of political tools to add value in line with the policy of equal opportunities , such as its legislation , the Fifth Programme , employment strategy , the guidelines , the mainstreaming policies , the social funds , and so on .
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union wants to make the creation of an integrated labour market a priority and that is a good thing .
The analysis which he has carried out is very painstaking , and it really does enable us to ask ourselves about the relevance and , the effectiveness of this European Employment Service , both in terms of its strategy and objectives and in relation to the resources which have been used in order to achieve the objective of worker mobility and access to the European employment market .
Among the members elected to the Chamber of Deputies is Mr Fatuzzo .
Several political personalities have had an opportunity to make their contribution , but we must involve the greatest possible range of actors , together with all the citizens of Europe .
This is fully in line with the fact that citizens do not want increased distance from the decision @-@ makers and increasing European political centralisation .
As a member of the European Parliament , I hope that the United States Government and the European Union can strike a proper agreement that will ensure a sustained reduction in the level of Greenhouse Gases .
In the newly elected Italian Parliament , the number of women has fallen : thus we are going backwards .
Parliament has completed its agenda .
It is time for reflection and analysis .
Your comments have been noted .
A revised draft of the Framework Decision with the Council &apos;s radical amendments is already available - but not to the European Parliament .
It is thus not only beneficial to launch dissuasion campaigns against the trafficking in human beings in all those countries of origin , poverty must also be addressed .
The proposed measures , which we shall support , aim to preserve the integrity of those who need us most , namely children .
Even today , in many cases of child pornography crimes , the inadequate minimum penalties available mean that a suspended sentence is imposed .
This should allow a clear signal to be given by both the European Parliament and the Council that we see animal welfare as a priority matter .
The definitions of the animals &apos; fitness for transport , but also vehicle standards , densities , travelling times and rest periods , etc. must all be brought into line with current scientific knowledge to a far greater extent .
The Food Safety Authority will need to address this matter .
If we want to have good animal welfare and a good environment , it will not come free of charge .
That is why this report is so important and above all why it is so important that the European Union adopts a vigorous initiative so that developing countries may really be included in the wealth society .
Since 1 January 1993 , however , measures became necessary , such as the harmonisation of requirements for sales and the uniformity of the control procedure for extra @-@ community exportation .
Approval of the Minutes of the previous sitting
The Environment Committee has also decided that the authority should be financed from the general budget alone .
The emphasis is placed on food production of higher quality .
No specific explanation has been given on this crucial point .
We must have clear European standards and European measuring methods .
We owe it to the public to provide objective reasons why they should again have confidence .
Amendments Nos 70 and 75 on whistle @-@ blowers are acceptable in principle , but we will consider a more appropriate text .
Naturally , the same rules which apply to domestic production are also to apply to export , re @-@ export and import .
Directives do not prevent natural cannibalism in animals .
Due to her and your efforts , I am in a position today to agree to the spirit and principles of the vast majority of your amendments , subject to some editorial changes .
The Council has also decided that it wants the target for the maximum number of exceedances to be 25 rather than 20 days .
So you are talking about a European Food Authority ? Well , where else to locate the European Food Authority but Parma ? &apos;
Mr President , the GUE / NGL Group could not support Mrs Karamanou &apos; s report on child pornography .
I owe that to the European Parliament and its Members who voted in favour of that report ten years ago . &apos; 
The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading ( A5 0187 / 2001 ) by Mr Davies , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive relating to ozone in ambient air &#91; 13114 / 1 / 2000 - C5 0090 / 2001 - 1999 / 0068 ( COD ) &#93; .
Thank you very much , Commissioner Wallström .
Furthermore in spite of all the rhetoric about trade policy supporting sustainable development , when you look at who attends the 133 meetings , it is usually simply the representatives from the trade and finance ministries alone .
At this point , I should simply like to recall the issue of the proliferation of weapons , because we do actually have political contacts and relations with one or two of the ASEM members , or we have developed mutually dependent relationships with them , and through this it is possible to exert considerable influence to prevent the dangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and carrier weapons . In this way we can make a contribution to world peace .
It contains three giants : Japan , China and India , which are going to be increasingly important on the international stage .
The Commission shares to a very large extent the evaluation and concerns expressed in the report , in particular those regarding the importance of further strengthening our dialogue with Asian @-@ ASEM partners on political , as well as on economic and social issues .
What I would like to see , however , are reports on the financial aspects .
The creation of delegations with a regional scope is not an acceptable alternative to the closure of delegations in countries such as Cape Verde or Costa Rica .
Proposal for a Council regulation on GSP for 2002 - 2004
I should like to come back once more to the system of incentives in the GSP , in the generalised system of preferences , which has of course been extended to social policy and the environment .
If I remember correctly , the hunger strikes in Turkish prisons have so far cost 23 lives .
If , however , things go badly , it would be extraordinary if the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , who is also part of the Swedish Government , had no interest in or responsibility for this matter .
We must be aware , and you know this , that USD 1 500 billion pass through the stock exchange every day and half of these transactions are made on the European stock markets .
I would just like to clarify what Mr Sacrédeus no doubt already knows .
In other words , EUR 10 million per year .
Electronic signatures , referred to in Amendment No 18 , can be one way of ensuring that invoices transferred electronically are genuine and that their content has not been interfered with but it is not the only way .
Finally , I wish again to support the amendments that extend the application of this scheme to both the European Parliament and the political groups .
It is so important for the future of the European economy as a whole that we get this package right .
The Right insists , and always in defence of companies , that these universal service obligations should be as limited as possible .
She rightly says that it is true that the additional statistics may mean limited excess costs .
The debate is closed .
Of course , the decisions will be taken under the Belgian presidency .
My group says a definitive no to this trend .
What should it decide ?
Last Thursday , the Irish unequivocally rejected the Treaty of Nice .
I only have one minute to congratulate the Irish people on their lucidity and courage and to thank them for saying &apos; no &apos; to the Treaty of Nice , and also to note that this means the treaty is now null and void .
The Commission has submitted a good document , but why did the Swedish Presidency remove this Commission proposal to stop subsidising fossil fuels from the draft conclusions even before the Heads of Government arrived in Gothenburg ?
However , in order not to damage the European project any further and not to weaken faith in the Union , we must also move forward on ratification of the Treaty of Nice and enlargement .
So it is in that spirit that we have made this change .
However much the leaders of the EU try to play down the results of the Irish referendum , they cannot alter the fact that the Irish people have spoken out against the barbaric and inhumane policy being imposed by the interests of big business on our continent .
the elimination of subsidies for the production and consumption of fossil fuels by 2010 ;
They could sign these directly democratic requests - these referendums and proposals for national legislation - electronically as well .
But there is also a third important element : that of ensuring fair competition between the various modes of transport .
In this case , we will close the loopholes not only by involving the pseudo self @-@ employed , but also the self @-@ employed as far as driving times are concerned .
The principle was clearly established in 1993 that directives are to avoid imposing administrative , financial and legal restrictions which would affect these kind of undertakings .
For this reason , to maintain and defend the proposed directive under discussion still makes total sense .
I should like to close by thanking the Commission for acting so quickly , and to thank all my fellow members whose comments and ideas helped considerably in improving the report and , by extension , the regulation .
The Council is the Community co @-@ legislator and the other arm of the budgetary authority alongside Parliament .
It has brought forward two comprehensive packages of measures in a relatively short period of time and has clearly demonstrated a proper appreciation of the urgency of the matter .
They have on occasion shown eye @-@ witness accounts to be totally unreliable .
Even if the debate has shown that one group is perhaps not completely satisfied on one or two points , we must admit that all three reports were adopted either unanimously or by a large majority in committee and we should maintain this majority in tomorrow &apos;s vote .
Oil catastrophes have concretely shown that relying on good luck costs society dear .
As it stands , the proposal could become over @-@ regulated , difficult to manage and have no added safety benefit .
Two , the OECD countries need to take measures to assume a fair share of the global financial burden of reducing poverty and disease .
This is a highly significant point . This is one of the reasons why we have insisted all along - it has not always been easy because public attention has been almost exclusively focused on HIV / AIDS - that malaria , TB and HIV / AIDS have to be looked at in the same manner .
Protection of minorities through safeguards against discrimination , access to education in minority languages and preservation of minority cultures have always been an important element of EU conditionality in our relations with Croatia .
To be honest , I cannot understand it .
. Mr President , I am very pleased with the generous remarks that have been made and apologise for not being here on time .
The Commission published a communication back then , on which I should now like to congratulate it .
Here the emphasis on biofuels and renewable energies is most welcome .
Without transparency there can be no democracy , not even in Europe .
We also believe that , slowly but surely , the implications for consumers should be made clearer .
It is for this reason that Amendment No 11 cannot be accepted .
There is a reasonable amount of burden @-@ sharing between the donors .
I should therefore like to urge you , Mr President , to make representations to the French Ministry of the Interior on the need for a permanent , practicable regulation for the drivers .
3 - The current revision must not threaten the livelihood of farmers operating under existing regulations .
With regard to the structural measures , we can take satisfaction from the fact that the Commission is proposing to raise Structural Fund assistance rates and the public subsidy limit for the outermost regions , even though the aim is really to enable these regions to regain funding levels close to those in force in the previous programming period .
VOTE
Many pollution accidents could have been avoided if there had been better safety .
Only a fraction of the money spent during the war , only a part of the resources and equipment that were used , would be enough to repair infrastructures , to rebuild roads , railway and telephone lines and to rebuild the buildings and business that were destroyed .
This could lead to a situation in which this measure , which we feel is reasonable , is not taken up by small farms because they say , no , we want the full payment , even if it is only a very small amount .
The decision to apply this system must be taken at the trial stage at national level when the Member States are given the opportunity to apply the small producer regulation on a regional basis .
We have suggested this in our proposal for a resolution , which the Group of the European People &apos; s Party will give their unreserved support .
That also explains why a country with such an institutional background , finds it terribly difficult , despite the peace agreements , to resource the authorities , values , the standards and the democratic capacity really to put its past behind it and to regard the peace agreements as a new beginning .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists asks you to support their resolution and also asks the Commission to adopt their declaration so that the government of Chad can learn of our concern and the sections of Chadian society that have been edged out of the electoral process can realise that they can count on our solidarity .
The Commission should also take the authorities in Cairo to task about this .
Religious minorities - first the Hindus and now all non @-@ Afghans - are forced to wear a yellow patch to identify themselves , resurrecting fatal memories of the totalitarian Nazi regime in my country .
Secondly , a military solution to the Afghan imbroglio is not possible .
The war has been going on for twenty @-@ five years ; and again we are about to vote on a resolution .
Civil emergency protection
More must be invested in these vaccines and in developing discriminatory diagnostic techniques , so that it will soon be possible to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals and then make economic use of vaccinated animals .
But these complex issues cannot be addressed in this directive .
I accept the amendments tabled by Mrs Maes , but personally I will not be taking part in the vote on Chad because I think it does not go far enough .
The flight was once again cancelled .
The citizen experiences this , in fact , as unnecessary interference from Brussels . My group has voted against it twice .
But the Commission is still concerned by the long delays in application which may lead to 10 years elapsing before the directive is able to produce its full harmonising effects .
From the end of 2002 it will help improve the situation of visiting motorists , namely those unfortunate European citizens who are victims of a road accident while they are outside their home country .
In my view , the information desk should be a facility and an effective guide and must act as a conduit to channel disputes to the alternative settlement of disputes procedure , for example .
Commissioner , once again , the report submitted by the European Commission on the operation of the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables , with a view to a future reform , is a disappointment .
The Commission cannot issue a calendar of any steps ahead .
As Mr Sterckx has said , I was the rapporteur for Parliament &apos;s response to the Commission &apos;s proposals on air transport and the environment last year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let us agree on one first thing : airports are a source of wealth and development .
During the Swedish presidency , the European Union &apos; s active presence in the Middle East has also , of course , been emphasised .
The European Council also noted that , in its plan of measures for better legislation - to be submitted to the European Council meeting in Laeken - the Commission will introduce mechanisms whereby all important political proposals will contain an assessment of how sustainability will be affected .
Many people demonstrated peacefully in Nice and in Göteborg .
What 50 000 people do is , in actual fact , more important than what 300 perpetrators of violence get up to .
If Swedish opinion polls are to be believed , there is an incredible amount of support regarding this issue .
Mr President , stones are neither left nor right wing , they are simply anti @-@ democratic .
I would argue that sustainable development and employment are part and parcel of the social dimension of the European Union .
I regret that the summit came to the conclusion that it should set aside the Irish referendum result and proceed with business as usual .
The American experience suggests the opposite , they have gone down exactly the opposite path , and no one could say that America &apos;s stock market is less dynamic than Europe &apos;s .
Mr Lehne makes a powerful point about the damage that can be done by golden shares , about the unfairness of the absence of a level playing field .
There was not a trace of mutual give and take !
Small gallery owners will be particularly hard hit , as they are far less able to withstand this pressure on prices .
We call on governments at other levels but also on firms to follow this example set by central governments .
I can understand the argument of Mr Duisenberg who says : we want to adhere to a decision we have taken . We want to be trustworthy in that respect .
Europe had no foreign policy and no strategies of its own for orienting globalisation and world finance , and this , together with the lack of economic strategy and the indifference displayed by institutional bodies towards the citizens , who had been neither consulted nor informed about the matter , meant that the launching of the euro resembled the building of a cathedral in the desert .
For this reason we too will not be voting for three of the proposals made by the rapporteur in her report .
In five countries the old automatic teller machines will have been converted by 1 January . That applies to the Netherlands , Germany , Belgium , Ireland and Luxembourg .
We have had and we will have in the future more epic debates on the question of knowing whether supplementary pensions must include mandatory cover for biometric risks .
The Commission is offering insurers the choice of opting for occupational pension schemes .
Does the Commissioner agree that this will lead to the revolution we have been pressing for , with a shift away from a concentration on initial education and training towards continuing training and lifelong learning ?
It includes seminars on capacity building sessions of the ACP Ministerial Trade Committee for negotiations of new , WTO @-@ compatible , trading arrangements with the EU .
This group of countries also stressed that the use of compulsory licensing was a crucial instrument for putting in place these public health policies and giving wider access to medicines .
This is our position .
Since this requirement is going to be maintained , is it not possible that some of these holdings will move to the dollar .
Question No 38 by ( H @-@ 0557 / 01 ) :
In the corridors , it appears that Member States know very well that their pensions are not sustainable .
We have not had a revision of these directives for nearly 20 years , so we are engaging in a bit of a fine @-@ tuning exercise to modernise and update them .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to thank Mrs Rothe for the sterling work she has done and by means of which she has laid the keystone for the first component : legislation in the field of renewable energy sources .
To sum up , I would also say that we must support the provisions laying down facilities governing grid access .
Therefore , the registration procedures have to be simple , easy and cost @-@ effective .
In the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy we had a very intensive and fruitful debate on the subject of radio spectrum policy , and I received some good amendments not only from my fellow Members of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , but also from Members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport .
I personally am a little afraid that we may have worked a bit too quickly and that we are in the process of developing quite a few hierarchies .
I would ask you to name those Member States which do not comply with these principles because we need success across the board for Europe &apos; s economy to be attractive .
You must use all your diplomatic skills to bring the United States , Japan and Australia back to the negotiating table .
What our predecessors constructed in Europe is too precious to us for that .
In Laeken , within the planned assessment of the degree of compliance with the European Commission &apos; s scoreboard for the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice , the Heads of Government are being offered an excellent opportunity to provide a political impulse for this process .
There are numerous questions and I would say to the Belgian Prime Minister : in the language of figure skating , your compulsory programme is outstanding , but you will be judged on your free programme , and in these efforts to win over the public Parliament will be at your side .
This intervention with a view to disarming the ethnic @-@ Albanian rebels is , however , subject to specific security conditions which the parties concerned have not yet fulfilled .
But we certainly do not want to spend money on weapons which extremist groups use to plunge democracies into a state of unrest .
I understand that because of time , the President @-@ in @-@ Office is not answering .
The word &apos; products &apos; has been left out of the Finnish version .
Furthermore , the Commission has pledged to instruct a committee of experts , by March 2002 to report on a number of alleged ambiguities and apparent imbalances which could lead to distortion of the internal market principles .
Instead of campaigning actively for new forms of electricity generation the individual consumer is first asked to buy cleaner energy at a different price from another supplier .
The way this debate is being organised in France , following the communiqué of 11 April this year published jointly by the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic , makes it quite clear that it has been rigged from the start .
This is the policy for monetary stability imposed by the Stability Pact , which the rapporteur is so pleased with , and with which we disagree , even though it does attempt to implement the ECB &apos; s policies , by means of greater economic coordination and greater development of the quarterly dialogue with the European Parliament .
Let me also point to the importance of flanking measures for all small and medium @-@ sized companies .
The report &apos; s key theme is freedom of speech , not just because both traditional and very new dangers threaten it , but because it has a strategic importance in improving the human rights of all - first , second and third generation human rights - and in exposing violations .
In particular , let me draw your attention and thoughts to a highly significant phrase : &quot; the Union should teach by example before it starts to preach . &quot;
In this year &apos; s report on human rights in the world , Mr Wuori chooses to focus on the issue of freedom of expression .
Unfortunately in the preparatory phase in the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs this substantive aspect of the human rights problem in the European Union was scarcely mentioned .
Cases such as that of Joaquín José Martínez lead us to be more optimistic about the influence of the European institutions and , in particular , our Parliament .
Another key factor lies in ratifying international instruments and translating them into everyday life : the right to move around freely , to live with one &apos; s family , to be a citizen .
It is quite right to link this report with the human rights charter .
The Christian minority in Turkey continues to shrink .
I wish to state that I was far from satisfied with the way in which the Secretary of State answered the legitimate questions asked by Caroline Jackson .
In what form will we be trading our emissions ?
We shall examine Questions to the Council .
But there are also fourteen other Member States , and it will therefore be important for the constitutional regions to bring harmony among themselves as well .
First of all : the Council is impressed with the progress made in terms of openness and transparency since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force , particularly with the adoption of Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament , Council and Commission documents .
Mr Milosevic has now been extradited by Serbia and Yugoslavia .
We are cooperating via two channels .
... of the Belliard building .
In any event , in this joint debate on Supplementary and Amending Budgets Nos 3 and 4 , the mandate for the budgetary conciliation and the report on the situation concerning the European Union &apos; s own resources , the PPE @-@ DE Group wishes to state that it is voting unanimously in favour in the first two cases and in favour by a majority in relation to own resources .
I put to her that the Prime Minister of Belgium only , in the last few days , said that he does not want to pursue this path towards a European Union tax because &quot; it is sensitive . &quot;
Amending Budget No 4 / 2001 is concerned with the use of the budget surplus from last year .
I must say straightaway that the Committee on Budgetary Control and this House are very much in sympathy with the principle of the agency that has been proposed to us , and our initial impression is a favourable one , because , in creating this agency , the Commission is responding to a matter of fundamental concern to Parliament , a concern which it expressed in the context of the budgetary procedure for the year 2000 .
We are opposed to putting a percentage figure on it , for we cannot possibly put a figure on it at the moment .
He had a really very tricky subject to deal with .
I am astonished at some of the opposition to the idea of binding legislation because it is essential to secure adequate funding for integrated coastal zone management initiatives across Europe .
Mr President , in my country fisherwomen represent all that is strongest and most courageous .
G8 Summit
We are not the only ones to feel this : the entire Catholic episcopacy of the host region has declared itself to be of the same opinion .
This is all the more important now that a summit issue which has never yet been on the agenda , is also set to become the subject of discussion and consultation , namely the gloomy prospects for growth in the world economy .
I , myself , have a boat over 30 years old in my boat house which would not meet these standards ; I believe it is a classic boat .
I should like to commend the rapporteur for having tackled all the most important problems and thank her for having adopted all my amendments .
I was faced with exactly that situation involving a Dutch development aid organisation .
The rapporteur agrees to the &apos; revenue &apos; side of this Supplementary and Amending Budget , in other words the reimbursement , which we support , of EUR 7.5 billion arising from the 2000 surplus to the Member States .
Furthermore , pollution of marine or terrestrial origin is increasingly contaminating soil and drinking water resources .
Europe must take effective , practical action to uphold the rights of the most incapacitated elderly people too .
I agree with Mr Méndez de Vigo that a European day against the death penalty would be extremely useful .
The death penalty in my view is barbaric , Mr President .
If we accept China &apos;s application to host the Olympic Games today , it would be like gilding the executions , the persecution of all political dissidents , the material and environmental destruction and the deportations which take place in China with the fine colours of the Olympic rings and all the flags . The result would certainly not be a reduction in these incidents ; quite the contrary : it is more likely that the show of indifference on the part of the international community would encourage them .
That is a dreadful thing to happen and we should add to this admirable motion for a resolution a clause calling upon those who are in authority in Uruguay to recognise the evil of disappearances , to recognise their bounden duty to bring children back to their parents and to end this scandal and disgrace .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Commissioner , it is often said that history repeats itself and , with regard to South Africa , this seems to be happening .
Situation of refugees from Burundi in Tanzania
Mr Khanbhai also raised a number of important issues about the management of our assistance and development programmes and about our representation in Africa and in other parts of the world .
That is why we have been so active in working at the United Nations on small arms and we must make use of the Community &apos;s competences , when we can , and with the Member States deal effectively with the illicit diamond and with other illicit trades which have caused so much suffering and impoverishment in Africa in particular , but in other countries as well .
For that matter , they are included in the report in such a way that it is largely up to the reader to interpret the figures and make what he considers to be the correct interpretations .
In theory , we introduced a uniform definition of tonnage which applies throughout the Community in 1994 in Regulation No 3259 .
We cannot be content with this state of affairs .
I thought that the Committee on Constitutional Affairs was making a request for this item to be placed on the agenda of this part @-@ session .
Parliament has a major role to play .
I should like to add that it is now ten months since political prisoners in Turkish prisons went on hunger strike in protest against the government &apos;s plans to keep them in tiny isolation cells .
He is quite right .
The rapporteur refers to taxation .
I would like to remind the members of the Council , as Mrs Weiler has said , that what is happening in Europe and in the rest of the world is that the people are extremely concerned , given the social advances they had achieved in each individual country , that the process of globalisation , the process of European Union construction - and next the enlargement of that Union - should not under any circumstances lead to a reversal of those social advances .
( The President cut the speaker off )
And it is they who are their only resource , the workers representatives and their solidarity , as well as the unions , in these very distressing circumstances .
There is no doubt that this has been a success .
This is something that we note every day in the Committee on Petitions , since it is the main form of non @-@ compliance : 40 % of non @-@ compliances reported by citizens to the Committee on Petitions relate to the environment .
The increasing awareness of the possibility of infringement of environmental law is another instance .
I am pleased to report that the basic objective of our February proposals , of which we are again reminded by Mr Harbour , of directly linking career advancement to proven merit has been accepted in the negotiations to date .
In Italy , there was a Ministry of Public Administration Reform for 20 years , and then they removed the word &apos; reform &apos; because it was becoming rather ridiculous that reforms were taking 20 years and it became the Ministry of Public Administration , full stop .
Ladies and gentlemen , as Minister Michel said when he spoke before the European Parliament &apos; s Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Security and Defence Policy on 28 August 2001 , there has , in recent months , been an escalation of violence in the Middle East .
I spent a good deal of my summer reading about the 1930s and about the relationship between economic impoverishment , economic hardship and political extremism in country after country .
If the European Union wishes to adopt the same policy , that should be made clear , and we should then no longer talk about the European Union &apos; s playing an active role in the Middle East .
The Palestinians simply want the rule of law to prevail and the principles of international law to be respected and put into practice as they have been proclaiming for decades , though so far fruitlessly .
They have one .
We are trying to ensure , as I have said before , that the assistance that we provide for the Palestinian Authority promotes pluralism , promotes clean government , promotes an independent judiciary , promotes the rule of law and promotes democracy .
Ladies and gentlemen , in the candidate countries , enlargement has become a strong incentive to take the measures needed to make the transition to a market economy .
I have the figures for the Federal Republic of Germany : in the last ten years , 900 000 people came to the Federal Republic of Germany from Poland , but 700 000 of them went back again .
It goes without saying that children &apos;s rights and the principle of non @-@ discrimination are the sort of principles to which we , as Europeans , must hold fast .
The Commission overlooks the fact that upholding the Benes Decrees , which justify the expulsion and murder of many thousands of people after the Second World War , is clearly contrary to the accession criteria established by the Community .
Thirty years of difficult negotiations , exemptions and exceptions , a legal basis that only serves to give illegitimate powers to the Commission in Brussels , an attempt to transform a directive into a regulation using an implementation group .
The conditions for European cooperation changed radically when the Wall came down , and the EU has so far been able to live up to these .
Commissioner Verheugen talked about that as well this morning .
As for the former , reference must be made , first of all , to Hungary &apos; s economic situation , which is continuing to improve , despite signs of the slowdown that are being felt everywhere .
Foreign interest exists in this sector and negotiations are in progress .
Let us all make a greater effort to limit these social problems that could , if we are not careful , become serious political problems .

I refer you to the statements on the matter made by the president of the European Council , Mr Michel .
If it is a means , what is the end ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , may I start by drawing your attention to the fact that the conclusions of the Wiersma report on the possible accession of Slovakia to the European Union have the full backing of the PPE group .
Surely the Spanish , or many of them , do not realise that .
Mr Prodi , you quite rightly said in your speech that , when we speak of governance , we are really talking about democracy .
That is , it will become the code , the rule which will enable us to work effectively and get back to the true spirit and meaning of the Treaties , to get back to the core working role of each institution .
Firstly , what consultation before the money is made available has been organised with research foundations , for instance universities , private research foundations and so on ?
The principles are totally unchanged .
It is necessary to approach this with caution .
However , this directive governs solely the initial entry into service of the car before its registration in the fleet of one Member State .
I will check the situation today .
This is precisely where the mistake in President Bush &apos; s calculation lies that is already beginning to concern North American businessmen , as we saw in Bonn : In the short term , Kyoto will cost less than was thought and will bring competitive advantages in the medium term .
Let us suppose that your estimates are right and that CO2 costs about EUR 30 a tonne .
One purpose of this rule is to prevent a Member State from pressurising its agency , i.e. the agency established on its sovereign territory , into setting up local offices .
In the limited speaking time I have , I want to focus on just one aspect and that is the health aspects of flying .
Similarly , the Commission proposals also differ .
I can understand that it might not please everyone because , from a traffic policy point of view , it is far from perfect .
Others also benefit from that measure , since it encourages the restriction of transport or its transfer to rail connections that are better for people and the environment .
I also understand that regions such as the Alpine regions and other particularly sensitive areas of the European Union can and should be given special protection where transport is concerned , road transport above all .
This is not about intervention , it is not about interfering in national cultural policy , no new wave of harmonisation is being started ; on the contrary , it is about bringing sermonising politicians down to earth and saying , could you please stop using subsidiarity as a veto .
But if it is being used to spy on foreign companies in order to tip the competitive balance in favour of domestic industries , that is quite a different matter .
I shall be staying in the House to listen to what you have to say .
These Member States , which are collaborating , were let off the hook totally .
The Netherlands will soon be debating a law on intelligence and security services in parliament . This law legitimises ECHELON @-@ type activities .
You have all carried out important work .
I should also like to thank Parliament as a whole for this very important debate .
Some environmental protection groups harass those involved in oil exploration or exploitation .
It may be that contemporary terrorism is more difficult to fight because it is less ideological and more sensationalist , because it is not based on political ideals but purely on violence , with precisely the aim of destabilising the institutions and terrorising the public .
I congratulate Mr Watson and all concerned in putting together this report .
Thank you , Commissioner Vitorino .
It will not be long before demonstrations and any form of civil disobedience are banned and made criminal offences .
It is now urgent to have consistent and common safety requirements in air transport .
There are nonetheless quite a few aspects of the report and of the enlargement negotiations as a whole that are particularly open to criticism .
The socio @-@ economic failure of Poland will be that of so @-@ called &apos; liberal &apos; formulae imposed by accession .
( FR ) Broadly speaking , we can only agree with the new strategy decided on at the Helsinki European Council of 10 and 11 December 1999 that aims to open negotiations with all Eastern European candidate countries - but not at any cost .
Protecting users of air transport , i.e. passengers , and guaranteeing their safety , health and consumers &apos; rights are becoming more and more important as air transport increases , especially as the new possibilities for travellers to book and buy airline tickets via the Internet offer advantages but also pose risks .
There are certain questions we must ask . Since this espionage system exists , why was it not used to prevent the violence which took place during the international summits , most recently the summits in Gothenburg and Genoa ?
This does not prevent us from demonstrating a very critical position in relation to the rights of European citizens contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
However , partly due to the attention that the movement has succeeded in drawing to these summits , it would be almost impossible to avoid addressing the role of the poorest countries and undertaking more convincing action with regard to the issues of debt , poverty , trade , the fight against disease and the environment .
This is also the basis of success for a fresh WTO round .
For the rest , Mr President , I am also convinced that the debate on globalisation has only just got off the ground and that we will be discussing it for the foreseeable future .
, draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
Despite this , with regard to sub @-@ category 1A of the financial perspectives , which covers the common agricultural policy , the Council has specified amounts which are generally EUR 200 million lower than the amounts which the Commission had proposed in its preliminary draft budget .
Given the well @-@ documented difficulties in meeting certain longstanding and more recent commitments , how can we accept the fact that in 2001 , Member States have been given back almost EUR 10 billion , which remain unused ?
Question No 3 by ( H @-@ 0599 / 01 ) :
It was also a response to the requirements of the Charter for Small Enterprises which was welcomed by the Feira European Council .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I can share the concern of the Member who asked the question , but having said that , I would like to clarify that olive residue oil is a by @-@ product of the olive , which is produced after obtaining the olive oil and , furthermore , from every 100 kilos of olives , 20 litres of olive oil and 1.6 litres of olive residue oil are obtained .
If not , would it like any help from the Parliament , which has been open to the public for so many years already ?
( The sitting was suspended at 7.13 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m. )
We have a situation , for example in Great Britain , in which 44 per cent of all e @-@ traders do not know that they are contravening this directive .
Mr Coelho asked whether it is difficult to control .
But we reiterate our objective of Parliament moving towards full codecision in respect of these matters .
I believe , however , that the attempt should be sustained , just as I believe there will be a very warm welcome for the abolition of mandatory notification and authorisation and the introduction of the exception rule , which seems to me a rather more liberal principle , especially in a sector - that of regulating authorities and competition - which is always running the risk of being a different , new instrument for state interference in market dynamics .
Our approach is to introduce a substantial framework first , leaving the possible introduction of common procedures and sanctions to a later stage .
Pentabromodiphenyl ether is a flame retardant , 95 % of which is used in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam for furniture and in particular upholstery .
This amendment goes beyond the present proposal to restrict the marketing and use of pentaBDE .
Every week we hear across the EU story after story about this issue .
But we have to carefully analyse all aspects of the issue .
This good cooperation is vital to ensure that the Ombudsman can deal with complaints promptly and effectively and thereby fulfils his mission of enhancing relations between the citizens and the Community institutions and bodies .
I appreciate that the Commission in particular , but also the other institutions , have adopted and are applying their own voluntary codes .
Mr President , Mr Söderman , it is more than ten years since we proposed introducing a European Ombudsman .
I should like to turn first to the Bösch report , the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman for the year 2000 . Allow me to say once again how much the Commission appreciates the excellent work undertaken by the European Ombudsman &apos; s office , and how grateful it is for it .
If you tell people about the possibilities then they will become much better known .
We have entered a season of reform , defence and strengthening of the institution of petitions and we believe that season of reform will give us the power to defend the citizens and , at the same time , make the European institutions better known to our ever @-@ growing population .
I agree with changes that add clarity to texts but do not change the substance .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.49 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon . )
Ladies and gentlemen , it is high time we voted .
Profit made directly or indirectly from trade in human organs , cells or tissues , is one of the most despicable manifestations of this system , an expression of the fact that society has not come out of barbarism .
In ten years &apos; time , this inadequate agreement will be deemed a disgrace .
Despite the fact that the judiciary has branded these activities as illegal , the pillaging goes on undeterred .
Mugabe must accept such a solution .
And finally , does New Zealand , the leading world exporter , not have an interest in seeing its potential market share in Europe increase as animals are slaughtered ?
I do not want you to help , I want you to do something so that we end up with a different strategy which we can then also secure through our trade policy .
We have no guarantee regarding these elections , because there is no independent electoral commission .
It is therefore essential that we continue to exert international pressure on the government to do everything possible to create a violence @-@ free period before the elections and to reopen the procedure for voter registration .
The desperation of the people on the Tampa is clear .
No doubt we shall need fresh impetus at an appropriately high political level , probably at the European Council in Laeken .
So far we have been incapable of responding to the long @-@ term needs or shortages .
Commissioner , I hope that if you really want to provide new impetus and a new strategy for mountain farming , you will take these proposals into account .
The debate is closed
The report of Mrs Kinnock is excellent .
The purpose of this meeting is first of all to demonstrate our solidarity with the American people , who have just been struck by a barbaric act of terrorism , to show our compassion for the victims , for the final toll will certainly be appalling , and to demonstrate our support for all those who are working tirelessly to save what further lives they can .
The Council has requested the presidency , the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Commission submit , as soon as possible , a report on concrete measures that may be recommended to speed up the implementation and the strengthening of the operational instruments of both the Common Foreign and Security Policy and in the field of Justice and Home Affairs .
After an outrage of this kind , there may , in other words , be a great temptation to call fervently for violent retaliation which would , however , have immeasurable consequences .
Neither , of course , do we currently have the necessary technological means , but the quest to acquire them would be a challenge worthy of consideration .
The candidate countries unanimously backed the declarations of the General Affairs Council and the declarations made by the Heads of State and Government .
The Commission has brought forward certain measures and there are others which the Commission and the Council could activate more quickly . For example , they could speed up the implementation of the conclusions of the Tampere Summit and the application of the Treaty of Amsterdam , they could speed up the ratification of the international conventions against terrorism - and this also falls within the competence of the Member States - and in particular the convention for the suppression of terrorist funding .
This fight is not a fight against Islam or its followers .
We owe it to all those who are combating terrorism and fundamentalism in the world .
Mr President , on behalf of my party , may I offer my deepest condolences to the people of the United States .
Europol is toothless if it has insufficient personnel at its disposal , and at present a mere 12 Europol staff are pursuing inquiries into terrorism in Europe .
On 11 September , it was not only the freedom but also the dignity of the human being that was attacked in New York and Washington .
In other words , that States have learned the lesson and that they are willing to give incontrovertible proof that they are improving cooperation in the fight against terrorism .
My second conviction is financial in nature . Even if the financial debate is , strictly speaking , premature today , I am not the only one to consider , as I already said here in a personal capacity , that a financial effort that would globally represent any less than 0.45 % of EU GDP would , in my view , call into question the credibility of the future cohesion policy .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , I too will take up your suggestion that this issue should be discussed without taboos .
When we asked the Council these same questions , it indicated that this was not the appropriate time to answer them , but Parliament has the right to ask the Commission and the Council these questions so that we might know their opinion , before producing our report .
I will make proposals in the new 2004 agenda for increased simplification and regionalisation , but , for me , the limit is to not permit the unravelling or the dismantling of this Cohesion policy which is one of the great and one of the strongest Community policies at the heart of European solidarity .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the reports we are discussing confirm some of my concerns regarding the execution of the Structural Funds for the 1993 @-@ 1999 period but , alas , also regarding the new programming period which will end in 2006 .
As you know , on @-@ site payments can be made up to 31 December this year , in accordance with the regulations .
The reality is that we cannot do it even if we would like to .
Of particular importance is the requirement for the introduction of specific national laws which also apply to circumcisions beyond national borders and which make it possible to punish citizens when they return home after travelling abroad to have their daughters circumcised .
The key mechanism is the job evaluation system , by means of which different jobs are ranked according to importance , and according to that job ranking , are allocated their salary scales .
I think it is quite essential if there is to be any point to this revision of the 1976 directive .
Very few countries have statistics in the form which I have referred to .
They did not succeed in forcing him out of that job but it was extraordinary that this should occur in this day and age .
Regulation was too weak and moreover , existing plants were excluded from the directive &apos; s scope .
The directive will actually protect jobs in the Welsh coal and generating industries in the longer term .
I think that we are now perfectly aware of the vital importance of this , and I therefore call on this Chamber to adopt Amendment No 5 on Article 2 of the original proposal for a decision , and ask the Commission and the Council to take this on board . This will bring the proposal for a decision before us in line with others which will soon follow in relation to the war on terrorism , as announced yesterday by Commissioner Vitorino .
As with Schengen , so with the social chapter and so with economic and monetary union - in all three cases Britain consented to a new EU initiative on the clear understanding that it would not be affected , only for its derogation later to be disputed .
As a general rule , we reject or resist the practice of holding asylum seekers in detention centres .
Otherwise , life in the refugee camps will be in even starker contrast to this ideal .
This does not imply that we have different objectives .
Other proposals will have to be taken into consideration .
The blow that this would deal to our countries could contribute to destabilising them even further .
.
As the rapporteur has emphasised , these practices are due to &quot; the growing number of short @-@ term contracts and insecurity of employment . &quot;
I want to say this because I wish to express my solidarity and that of my group with the statements by the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , the Vice @-@ President of the Commission , Mr Patten , the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Michel , the President of the French Republic , Mr Chirac , and in this case I regret that we have not heard him speak - since he always does so authoritatively , bravely and appropriately - in relation to the unfortunate public remarks of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy , Mr Berlusconi , on the supposed superiority of Western civilisation over other civilisations .
He also asked us to extend his respects to you , Madam President , and to the House as a whole , and hoped that in due course he would be able to visit the European Parliament .
I would also point out that the communication refers to the guidelines for trans @-@ European transport networks and so this issue might also be dealt with tomorrow , when we are given the Commission communication .
Many other Members , in addition to myself , will take part in this debate on additional measures which could be envisaged , including at a European level , particularly with regard to monitoring .
Whatever the cause , it would be wise to produce a list of the most dangerous sites and to relocate them away from housing .
Also the government itself , which waited until 1999 to implement the Seveso II directive , which was voted for in 1996 , and was a clearly inadequate directive .
I therefore repeat once again , and I would like to cite the European Commission in its explanatory statement , it is not the intention to establish limiting values which apply to the entire European Union .
I believe that military aviation should have no place in this directive and nor will it find its way into it . In other respects , I believe this debate to have been basically necessary .
In truth , noise and the activities which create noise - there is nothing more horrendous than a machine digging a hole in the street , and not allowing us to live - are mostly subsidiary . They come within the competence of local authorities , and it is therefore very difficult to get different towns to agree , for example , on closing times for bars , because they all want to compete .
What is this compromise about ?
The Commission is not able to accept Amendments 4 , 5 , 9 , 16 and 29 .
Mr. President , over the previous decade the European Coal and Steel Community has borrowed money from the markets and in turn has loaned funds for research activity in the coal and steel sector .
The next item is the statement by the Commission on the White Paper on Reform of European Governance .
A second point in the White Paper that I would like to mention is the &apos; culture of consultation and dialogue &apos; .
Lastly , Mr Prodi , will you organise a public platform for the leaders of the candidate countries that will be joining the EU ?
Will this not mean that we are making the playing field for the various parts of civil society in the European Union still more uneven ?
In the discussion on the relationship with Parliament , the call @-@ back problem lies in this context .
I have always stressed in these debates here with the European Parliament , but also with the Council , that we need common immigration and asylum policies more than ever .
What is at stake here is controlling the immigration of workers and maintaining social , economic and political stability in the European Union .
Let me explain .
In the meantime , however , if anyone wants to read a good document which clearly sets out the real problems associated with immigration and their possible solutions , they have to refer not to the Commission communication which is being examined today , but to the strategy paper on asylum and immigration , the amended version of which was tabled by the Austrian Presidency on 19 November 1998 - yes , I did say 1998 .
I wish his report every success , and we will certainly be supporting it .
We must insist on the need for the major educational programmes which are the foundations of our culture , and of multiculturalism , in particular : there must be schooling and education starting with foreign children , especially , irrespective of their legal position .
We must ensure that the countries that receive refugees really do have the means to do so .
I welcome the work of Member States towards a UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons , reminding Parliament that the definition includes things like shoulder @-@ carried , anti @-@ aircraft missiles .
Now the very concepts of what constitutes a weapon are in doubt , when a civilian aeroplane can become a missile when guided by a murderous ideal .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
To date , each of our Member States has failed to earmark sufficient funding .
I am thinking of the hundreds of thousands of refugees waiting at the border with Pakistan , and also of the people who for months now have been completely without supplies in the northern provinces .
Let us target terrorism : let us remove the causes that conceive , feed and sustain terrorism .
Thank you for your patience .
It does not mean that 10 % or 20 % will be granted .
The Commission raises the question from a general political viewpoint , and I can assure the honourable Member that when speaking to the authorities of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia we have always urged the need for decisions to be taken as quickly as possible .
As regards the legal instruments , as I said earlier in my reply to Mr Alavanos , the Commission will use all the legal instruments at its disposal .
Mr President , first of all the Commissioner is being very facetious with his answers .
It promotes the feeling of victimisation in people who already have the sense that they are victims .
Because , unfortunately , the forum was overpowered by very specific and special issues .
Noticeable , in fact , is the absence of the worldwide NGOs , and the virtual absence of the NGOs involved in immigration in Europe .
And finally , two centuries after the events , Europe has apologised for the slave trade .
What , then , should have been discussed ?
For years now people with disabilities have not been able to get around the towns and cities of the European Union as they should ; they have been trapped for too long in their own houses .
As we want to offer the best service possible , we set great store on compatibility with other systems from the outset .
That is absolutely not the case .
The money and resources needed for developing completely new technologies often do not exist in private companies .
This is a healthy and sensible approach .
In Lisbon and Stockholm , it was decided that Europe should become the world &apos; s most dynamic and competitive knowledge @-@ driven economy .
Until the early 1990s , capital @-@ intensive industries spearheaded productivity growth .
I am speaking as someone concerned with consumer affairs .
I would also call for the judgment to be brought up at the first meeting of the Conference of Presidents to be held directly after such an investigation of the judgment has been carried out . In that context , we shall be able to debate a package of arrangements for independent MEPs and smaller political units which are not large enough to form a group and , in that way , be able to secure the fair treatment of MEPs .
I would point out that the Extraordinary European Council hoped to implement all the measures decided by the European Council at its meeting in Tampere in October 1999 .
My final remark will be a personal challenge to you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , as much as to anyone else . We are all facing a challenge as regards the security of our institutions .
The fact that the majority of the people in the world live in a state of despair , poverty and underdevelopment can never justify terrorism - never . This situation must be fought and eradicated by action , not just formal declarations , if we want our world to be at peace .
For terrorists do not give warnings , something which a Minister for the Interior should realise .
The resolution which came about under the competent guidance of Mr Collins receives our full support .
We must resume our work on light arms trafficking .
In the immediate aftermath , still in shock , the European Union proved equal to the occasion at the Brussels Summit .
Let us finally take account of these positive or disturbing trends and organise a world in which each individual is recognised , respected rather than despised , involved rather than ignored .
As Mrs Béres and Mr Salafranca said , we must build a global alliance and wage a global fight against terrorism .
I indeed hear this gospel , but I have no faith !
For certain people in certain sections of society , there is a danger in any country .
to create a European network for immigration as an observatory and census mechanism .
But to leave this objective in the report completely contradicts what we believe to be an ethical policy on arms .
The international exhaustion of trade mark rights will be of no advantage to the consumer in the European Union as regards food and drink , as is confirmed by the study produced by National Economic Research Associates ( NERA ) at the Commission &apos;s request .
The agenda of the Belgian Presidency therefore allows some time for us to refine effective methods to calculate the disparity between production and potential growth . These methods should be used in future stability programmes .
That is the Socialist policy mix .
There is a clear signal coming from EU citizens that while they continue to support the thrust of EU integration , they want it to happen in a manner which reflects the independence and the integrity of each Member State and its citizens .
Some say , wait and see what happens .
It took us fifteen years to recover from the effects of this policy . I do not wish this policy to be implemented in the European Union .
And it is not true that the Stability and Growth Pact did not allow enough leeway for hard times .
The main objectives of the directive have been achieved , but a thoroughgoing revision of the directive is needed .
Furthermore , sport is one of the fields of activity which most affects and touches on the citizens of the European Union regardless of their age or social origin , and therefore sport cannot and must not be discriminatory and all the citizens of the European Union must be able to see sporting events .
The European Union also expressed its hope to see the governments of Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina and Republika Srpska implement all the recommendations that have been made .
For each of those topics from the High @-@ Level Group &apos; s action plan , a dossier will be drawn up concerning the projects to be carried out jointly .
The response is as follows : the question that was put by the honourable MEP falls outside of the Council &apos; s competence .
In addition , children must be protected .
I sometimes wonder whether the tone adopted by some of the Members has anything to do with my sex , age or something else .
By rejecting Amendment No 7 , this is what they have done .
We consider that public investments can have a very positive value and can help to shift the direction of our economy , as we recognise our ecological responsibilities .
What is completely unacceptable is the policy of the Spanish central government of Mr Aznar , which covers up its real budgetary deficit by financing it with revenue , with the monthly contributions of workers integrated into the state social security system , which compromises even further the uncertain future of pensions , and the workers who are currently contributing do not know whether they will receive those pensions on retirement .
If , in your report , you were to write about the effects of the European budgetary policy on employment , then I would gladly vote in favour of all your amendments , but they did not feature in the framework of my report .
On the issue of mergers , a communication on corrective provisions has been adopted , as has a simplified procedure for certain straightforward types of operation , so that now about 40 per cent of merger cases can be dealt with in this way .
I am not going to put my credit card number on the Internet just like that .
It also allows us to hold a kind of joint debate today .
The first phase is now being carried out .
In conclusion , Mr Ettl has put forward certain wishes .
Of the points agreed , I particularly welcome the fact that stronger action can now be taken at Community level under the rapid alert system where there is a serious risk to consumers , so that dangerous products can be taken off the market .
By then , there will be major problems in combating AIDS and also tuberculosis .
This is why we call on you to vote in favour of the report , and we hope that all of these speeches will for once not go unheeded , because the people of the South need us .
All this threatens the whole credibility of the World Trade Organisation and any chance we have of believing in the developments at Doha , or if we ever have a new round of fair , multilateral trading systems .
Women - and I am not saying anything new - are extremely vulnerable to poverty .
I therefore give him the same answer : I am sorry .
While reaffirming our complete opposition both to terrorist methods and to the reactionary objectives pursued by those responsible for these acts , we refuse to associate ourselves will all of the proposals from the Council of the European Union .
That is why we must always draw a sharp distinction between opposition , in particular , campaigns resulting in socio @-@ economic and administration changes , and irrational violence , which is only aimed at bringing about fear and destruction .
( Speech cut short pursuant to Rule 137 of the Rules of Procedure )
All the choices made by big business illustrate how worried it is about the possible renationalisation of competition policy ( i.e. control by the Member States , not the Commission of the European Union ) , which is why the report proposes an international competition system in the framework of the WTO .
Ultimately , we have now achieved what this House has always asked for .
Human rights
Injustice and the suppression of press freedom have increased , as has the suppression of religious freedom .
We must keep this sense of responsibility alive and remain vigilant to the potential dangers in a geo @-@ political context that remains highly uncertain .
At the European Councils of Lisbon , Nice and Stockholm , Member States made a commitment to promote sustainable economic growth and quality employment which will reduce the risk of poverty and social exclusion as well as strengthening social cohesion in the Union between 2001 and 2010 .
This programme envisages the support of actions and movements already being implemented by civil society at local and regional level .
Mr Dupuis mentioned the issue of our delegations .
This means that there is a danger that a monopoly may be created , which will put the quality of European diagnostics at risk .
However , you have not answered the question put to you by myself , Mr Blokland , and others on whether Article 5.1 now applies in this context or whether Article 5.2 should take priority .
In his excellent report , Mr Fruteau welcomes the progress in relations between the European Union and the OCTs from an institutional , economic and financial point of view , even though there remain many questions on the Commission &apos; s proposals having to respond to the objectives included in declaration 36 with regard to the OCTs annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I would , however , like to publicly demonstrate , once again , our solidarity and deep sympathy for the families of the victims .
But it was Mrs Villiers &apos; own group which held out against an obligation on lawyers to report suspicious transactions and therefore held up the final resolution of this matter for six months after our plenary vote in April .
We consider that each Member State must carry out a complete reassessment of its approach to the security of infrastructure and installations , particularly the most risk @-@ sensitive such as nuclear installations .
Now , I accept that many in our countries are opposed to nuclear energy , and that , in some countries , they may well be in the majority .
This applies to the examples given regarding the security of the Sellafield and Cap de La Hague re @-@ processing plants .
It is scarcely comprehensible that the budget procedure of the European Community should be applied to finance Schengen II without the body legislating for that budget - namely Parliament - being informed about these developments at the time .
The point here is that , as far as the continuing application of the Schengen Agreement is concerned , the Council has only updated the European Parliament once , meaning that Parliament is unaware of issues which impinge directly on the free and unimpeded movement of citizens or how the Union &apos;s borders are controlled .
As has already been said , the importance of providing greater incentives for public participation has already been recognised at international level , with the Aarhus Convention .
Thank you , Mrs Korhola , we have taken note .
These investment managers were usually law firms , private partnerships , which managed the assets of their clients very successfully .
Europe must become more active in international bodies .
Remove this reinterpretation ; in Liège we find ourselves .
A majority of Parliament has campaigned for a long time for local and regional efforts to be incorporated into employment policy , and we have pointed out that the exchange of experiences and methods with those operating at local level and working in a voluntary capacity could be financed via Article 129 .
It is my genuine hope that this House will confirm the wide majority reached in committee and will lose no time in providing the Union and the Member States with this major legislative instrument during the Belgian Presidency .
It is very important that the Member States themselves should devise appropriate sanctions , that this is done by means of agreements between the social partners and that we take account of the Member States &apos; different systems .
Yet , we can no longer defer the enforcement of these rights .
We are very keen that this topic should find its way into all policy areas by a kind of mainstreaming .
Instead of despairing over poor growth forecasts as if these were gloomy weather reports , we should try to shape this policy in accordance with our objectives on social and territorial cohesion , and decide on , for example , the necessary large @-@ scale investments , including public investment , draw up a European job creation policy , and not simply a work placement policy .

It simply means choosing another method , and it is worth emphasising that the action values must go on being maintained .
Although we consider that lower values more in line with the amended proposal would be more appropriate , we have accepted the Council &apos;s common position with a view to achieving a global compromise .
More and better jobs mean greater economic and social cohesion .
Mr President , I voted for the second von Boetticher report .
Only by adopting this approach will the discharge of the budgetary process be worthwhile .
I hope that this dialogue will be fruitful , so that we can reach an agreement which is satisfactory to everyone , but particularly to the European citizens , of course .
Hence my plea to you to negotiate it again with great precision , in order to find room in SAPARD for your demand for more information along the lines of the LEADER programme to be made available for rural areas .
We see it as very important that the information campaign on the euro should be carried on for another half @-@ year , for we find an information deficit here despite great campaigning efforts .
Let me take this opportunity to thank the general rapporteur for working so well with me and my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee .
I urge the Commission to make sure that they become a permanent part of your proposals - this will save some effort on our part to ensure that this interinstitutional work is continued .
So the Council must bear its share of responsibility for this if its action is to be approved .
Please bear in mind that we have an interest in dealing with these things as part of the Community Budget , where , to a large degree , they rightly belong .
I am thus in favour of the amendments which he has tabled in this connection , with only one exception : the increase in payment appropriations is rather extreme in my opinion .
In spite of this , the Council will prevent us from using those funds that are not needed for the fisheries agreements , and that is something I do not understand .
Why ?
We proposed estimates for funds to promote tourism in Europe .
Funds are gradually transferred to it from the Guarantee Reserves as guarantee commitments are made .
I also support the Commission &apos; s proposal that there should be a special budget heading created for it so that the way in which the funds are being used can be monitored .
As far as the application of Article 6 is concerned , the unit which deals solely with Article 6 was created , staffed and started operating in December 2000 .
However , it is , of course , positive that sexual intimidation is recognised as a form of discrimination , particularly against women , but recognition is as far as it goes .
Allow me an additional ten seconds - given that Mrs Lulling was given an extra two minutes - and allow me to say to the latter that my marriage would never have survived if my wife and I had not shared the parental leave equally .
Amendments Nos 7 and 17 reformulating the text of the common position on maternity and paternity leave by reintroducing inter alia the idea of maternity and paternity leave where children are adopted .
Medical equipment including disposable syringes and baby scales had for years been claimed at many times their actual value .
Ladies and gentlemen , I can see that Mr Nielson is in agreement .
This issue is essential for the Union &apos; s regional policy , but , as I said before , statistical classification must not prejudice the nature of the Union &apos; s future regional policy .
Please permit me one final observation : there has been a certain amount of friction between the Presidency of the Council and the Commission , which is very regrettable in view of the Presidency of the Council being held by Belgium .
In some ways , therefore , there is nothing new in this statement ... I am saddened and concerned by this attitude , as it almost puts Europe out of the running altogether , at a time when much is expected of Europe , of a political Europe , not of a military Europe , and of a Europe which , admittedly , has expressed solidarity with the United States in tracking down these terrorist networks , but failed , however , to provide unconditional support for the unilateral choices made by those in Washington .
And Mr Prodi , you asked if Europe was absent from the world stage .
In this respect , my suggestion would be to adopt a reasonably hard @-@ handed approach towards both parties , for we need to table such a proposal now .
Monetary union is , after all , not only for large businesses but also for every citizen .
Now this no longer holds true .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 10 a.m .
Seppänen report ( A5 @-@ 0350 / 2001 )
Personally , I am not surprised by the quality of this analysis , given the experience and expertise that Mr Poos has gained over many long years and which he is now putting to use at the European Parliament .
We hope that less emphasis will be placed on these meetings and that they will instead be transformed into working meetings .
Mr President , every single pronouncement by the European Parliament expresses our faith in democracy , transparency and efficiency .
All this slows down the process .
This must also work towards a better environment , social development , the reduction of poverty , and human rights .
I feel it is right to raise the issues of WTO reforms , legitimacy and transparency of decisions so that we do not lose sight of the WTO &apos; s primary , unique mission which is to extend international trade .
His task will certainly be a difficult one .
In our view , the European Union should propose a de facto hierarchy of standards at international level , with which all countries must comply . In other words , it should recognise that business law or trade law cannot supplant the principles of environmental protection , public health and respect for the social rights of workers .
You emphasise the importance of the WTO addressing the public &apos; s concerns , over and above the traditional issues of access to the markets or of customs tariffs .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the crisis which has its origins in the terrible attacks on 11 September in the United States has shown that the European Union is capable of reacting in a rapid and coherent manner .
Firstly , 11 September was an opportune moment for the European Union to demonstrate that it could play a positive , peaceful and reflective role with the United States , in order to find , in the International Criminal Tribunal and through International Law , a solution to the conflict .
We have too little control over this because we have not sufficiently developed this kind of cooperation .
The European Union does not impose one single model .
And it is true that while we are perfectly aware of the difficulties faced by Turkey as a result of the presence of Islamic fundamentalist elements on their territory , which are a danger , which require certain measures to be taken , at the same time we must accept that , in terms of democratic principles , the journey they have to make is still , to say the least , very long .
I think that Turkey has built up an internal mechanism and a system of external relations which is dominated by the idea of authority and it uses this to tyrannise its people - witness the terrible story of prisoners &apos; suicides and much else besides .
However , we all know , and Turkey should also know , which is why we must say so loud and clear , that they represent enormous progress within Turkey itself .
Mr President , the Commission is delighted by the report which has been drawn up by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , in relation to this proposed directive establishing harmonised requirements and procedures for the safe loading and unloading of bulk carriers .
Certain China @-@ specific quantitative restrictions are to be phased out .
But I think that to overemphasise this in the report without , at the same time , trusting in the fact that China is more than capable of evaluating whether or not it is in a position to cope with accession is to underestimate China &apos;s capabilities considerably .
However , as much as we praise diversity in theory , unfortunately often we fail to respect it in practice .
I would like to thank the European Parliament for the consistent display of concern and support for the non @-@ violent Tibetan freedom struggle .
I only have the English text with me now .
Local and regional governments and administrations believe that the Commission &apos; s proposed programme of assistance to border regions fails to match the scale of the challenge .
In addition , they are planning close collaboration with the USA on a whole series of issues , including judicial assistance .
The absolute requirements of this reform should be the reinforcement of democracy and transparency , the involvement of citizens and control by them .
This WTO is trying to maintain these abuses , and in doing so forms a threat to welfare , the environment and democracy .
There is money there .
The third shortcoming concerns the non @-@ inclusion of flexibility mechanisms that would enable the Member States to make adjustments to national and regional situations .
Above all , it is also a lot less bureaucratic because none of the expensive market intelligence on which the deficiency payments are currently based and all the complex calculations involved will any longer be necessary .
We must not be ashamed to talk about the economic aspect as well , since the Mont Blanc tunnel , like all passes through the Alps , responds to demands which are not solely economic but may be expressed in economic terms , and which need to be met to enable the various nations , citizens and groups operating in the fields of industry , trade and tourism to carry on their activities .
Between the first half of 2000 and the first half of 2001 , rail freight between Italy and France fell by 8 % and combined transport by 10 % .
Of course not .
The vote will take place this afternoon at 6.30 p.m .
However , I cannot shake off the impression that the Commission still does not realise that they are missing the boat with the current multiannual guidance programmes .
What is more likely is that the entire MAGP IV exercise will have had no effect .
All of this has its place within the framework of the debate we have held today on development cooperation and respect for the resources of third countries , certainly , but also in the knowledge that there are fishing opportunities which have not yet been utilised .
Mr President , I did not want to draw your attention to this point before the vote , so I waited until after the vote .
I am simply giving you this information so that you are aware .
Madam President , you will know that the City of Strasbourg is twinned with the City of Leicester , my home city .
Before I speak further , I should like the services to rule whether Amendment No 17 from the Green Group is admissible , because it seeks to rewrite the regulation .
Openness makes little sense , of course , if nobody is interested in the work we do .
But resolved it must be , one way or the other .
On the one hand , we are relying too heavily on the benevolence , or lack thereof , of the Member States , while on the other hand , there appears to be an evident lack of confidence in democracy , notably parliamentary supervision of this highly important area of policy .
Thus , this Swedish initiative extends the Union &apos; s area of free movement beyond the official geographical borders of Europe , with the corresponding consequences for the legal and judicial sphere , making Norway and Iceland countries in which the common rules on extradition contained in the Schengen acquis will apply .
It may be that as electronic commerce develops , it will provide greater protection , but it does need to develop first . We must start by allowing electronic commerce to develop , but in order to do so we need to have confidence in it , and this proposal does not inspire that confidence .
There has been huge public international debate with industry , with scientists , with lawyers .
That is wonderful .
The results of the various studies and of the public consultation will provide a significant contribution to the communication on the review of the directive and any proposals for amendments , which the Commission plans to submit to the Council and to the European Parliament towards the end of 2002 .
There is to be no general maximum journey time , and prime consideration was given to the situation of remote regions and islands .
Mr President , Ireland is committed to working with all Member States and international bodies to achieve higher standards in animal welfare .
Decision on urgent procedure
Structural rigidities have often to be overcome , and in the areas of shared or decentralised management , which account for more than 80 % of the general budget , the Commission requires action from others , such as Member States .
I join with the Court of Auditors in calling for a simpler scheme which , being more easily monitored , would lessen the likelihood of error .
It is on the right track .
Thank you for your fruitful cooperation over seven years .
As successive international reports have made clear , lawyers and other professionals become vulnerable to exploitation as unwitting accomplices in the washing of dirty money from criminals and terrorists as banks tighten up , which , I am glad to say , they are at last having to do .
Mr President , there was a time when Europeans travelled all over the universities of Europe and studied what was still a common law based on the Roman law .
The Commission , together with the diplomatic missions of the EU Member States , is following the human rights situation in the country closely and participating in all EU démarches to the government of Laos PDR on these issues .
We must of course guarantee the protection of the users , especially of the young .
What falls at this arbitrary threshold ?
The official sitting your left looked in my direction but did not inform you .
A wrongly @-@ conceived protection of personal data can , however , have unwanted side @-@ effects .
As I see it , the real villain is the mayor of Bucharest , not the poor dogs killed in the city .
If the plenary follows the same line of thinking , we could save ourselves a great deal of upheaval and bother .
We all want the best possible local public transport at the lowest cost to taxpayers and passengers .
Whilst I appreciate the importance of ensuring that groups such as disabled people , schoolchildren and trainees are also eligible for reduced cost public transport , it would be ridiculous to undo the good work the National Assembly has done for pensioners in Wales by preventing pensioners enjoying concessionary travel under this regulation .
Mr President , ports , particularly seaports , are normally cosmopolitan systems and they are junctions in the TENs for traffic by ship and sea , which is in principle the most environmentally @-@ friendly mode of transport .
I would like to make several points :
The unedifying dispute about duty free is still in my mind .
If we were to remove this article , we would have to apply the rule established in another paragraph , which would authorise the greatest possible number of service providers , a consequence which I do not believe was intended on presenting this amendment .
We will lay down a general framework for the negotiation of the financial chapter which ensures that it can be dealt with in a common framework , and we will be doing this very early in 2002 , so that the Spanish Presidency will have the chance to keep to the timetable .
This procedure has been well established and has proved its worth .
I ask you , Commissioner , to tell us how the rights of the Kurds are affected and how you assess the political situation in Turkey as regards constitutional changes and the Kurdish question .
I am not asking you to disclose the discussions you are having with the Member States .
I would like to ask the Commissioner what comparisons have been made of the different advertising used in different countries at this time of year ?
Questions to Mr Liikanen
The Commission proposal has yet to be submitted , and it then has to be adopted by the Council and Parliament .
I believe that if the honourable Member examines the Commission &apos; s specific proposals to the Council and the European Parliament , both with regard to immigration and to asylum , she will see that the idea of information about rights is present .
What is the economic justification for the continuation of the Sellafield nuclear plant , let alone the expansion of its nuclear operations in the future ?
With regard to nuclear energy , I am very satisfied with the frank and constructive exchange of views which the presentation of the Green Paper has made possible .
For too long we have seen a gradual increase in allergenic reactions and even worse human health effects and at the same time a series of undesirable effects on the general environment .
It is a classic export of pollution , as many enterprises that are already being marginalised by the European Union will move themselves very quickly even nearer to its boundary and indeed also outside the EU in order to save themselves these unimaginable impositions .
And one more little observation : which substances are actually necessary to society ?
But the question arises of how suitable it is to proceed in this way .
I would wish to emphatically warn against mentioning or even attacking individual Member States .
In addition to the three above @-@ mentioned points , fellow MEPs have added a number of useful suggestions : clear responsibility not only for products but also for retailers ; paying attention to the role of local councils and of consumers ; and paying attention to planning and transport packaging .
The next item on the agenda is the Report ( A5 @-@ 0359 / 2001 ) by Mr Berenguer Fuster on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive &#91; COM ( 2000 ) 511 - C5 @-@ 0484 / 2000 - 2000 / 0213 ( COD ) &#93; on insurance mediation .
That was the basis for the reasoning and you are quite right to raise it .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has worked intensively on the research framework programme .
We have a lot to do . We have also made significant progress on matters concerning young people , grants and women and preventing brain drains .
Therefore it is necessary to make adjustments approved by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy to the direction that the already existing Craft programme arrangements will continue to take .
We must be led by our conscience to jointly outline this framework , even if we fail to see eye to eye on this matter .
At the moment , this is written not so much in the stars as in the heads of the civil servants or , indeed , the Commissioner .
In the economic , financial and commercial field , Mr President , we think that the European Union should complete the agreements that are currently under negotiation with Mercosur and Chile .
To do otherwise would be to put the cart before the horse .
We believe that the European Parliament should maintain its position that a dispute settlement procedure should be initiated .
It refers to the same paragraph .
In a port , there should only be one authority for pilotage and one for mooring , for the same reason .
In the name of legal certainty and fair competition between European ports , it must be possible to subject grants paid by national authorities to detailed inspections .
. I warmly welcome this report by Gerard Caudron , which recommends changes in the allocation of spending to the Commission &apos;s proposal for the EUR 16 bn research budget .
At the same time , the European ministers jointly decided that the Member States should try to protect the airlines from the worst consequences of 11 September , for instance , by giving them insurance cover against acts of terrorism , something the commercial insurance companies were no longer offering , while avoiding a war of subsidies , which would distort competition .
We thought that was what ESDP was , until we discovered recently at Downing Street that it is European security and dining policy .
There must be a safe and consistent delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need .
Mrs Durant has the floor on behalf of the Council .
Secondly , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you have not told us how you intend to exert greater pressure on the United States , given that the whole business is down to them .
We believe that it should also include special ships for the transportation of gases derived from oil and liquefied natural gas , as well as ferries , bulk carriers and roll @-@ on roll @-@ off car ferries , all of which are included in the complaints presented to the WTO .
But while we hope that the Commission will implement this regulation at least by 2003 , we hope for a lot more for the future and a different attitude towards the sector .
By creating this strategy on sustainable development , the European Council has given priority , in terms of the environment , to climate change , to ecologically viable methods of transport , to the responsible management of natural resources and , lastly , to the management of risks to public health .
Under this accession partnership , Turkey adopted a national programme for adopting the acquis , which sets out the framework for the policy to be pursued and the timetable of legislative work , as well as the budgetary and administrative requirements that are necessary in order for Turkey to adopt the Community acquis .
As they deal with the same subject , Questions No 10 and 11 will be taken together .
That goes without saying .
It is on this basis that the Council is currently examining a proposal for a Council framework decision on the fight against terrorism .
If money can be made with motorways then it will be .
That is why I welcome both the tone and form of the regulation .
We can thus accept that amendment .
If we increase the price of cigarettes , as is proposed , then we shall , without question , increase cigarette smuggling because we shall be making legal cigarettes more expensive than smuggled cigarettes .
But the form in this respect is important .
The amendments contained in the Committee on Fisheries &apos; report , in summary , modify the proposed regulation in the following fashion :
Mr President , the proposal that the Commission is putting forward is to be welcomed but needs improving .
If we are to be able to restructure and stabilise the air transport industry as we must , the problem of ownership and control needs to be resolved now more than ever .
Madam President , Commissioner , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , the economic and employment situation in the airline industry and in the related industrial and services sectors is critical .
Instead , it is now happening in a chaotic manner .
We are all aware that this crisis has roots in the past , that it is more than just a consequence of the events of 11 September , that it is also the result of excessive market fragmentation .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and , I am sure , Parliament as a whole , approves the choice of the open @-@ cooperation method . It has proved its worth in this area .
Madam President , I understand that the report by Mr Katiforis has been accepted .
Of course , that requires a proper safeguard and proper defence rights .
Energy policies to make use of domestic energy sources obey the same diktat , with adverse repercussions on grass @-@ roots interests , growth and the supply of high @-@ quality , safe and environmentally @-@ friendly energy to the country as a whole .
, in writing .
I welcome the Schörling report but prefer , where the tonnage threshold is concerned , the position of the European Commission .
You have one minute .
I welcome Amendment No 2 which aims to prevent the introduction of new restrictions beyond those currently in place in the Member States , and also Amendment No 9 which proposes to prohibit threshold provisions in order to qualify for claims under the directive .
I remember announcements , official pronouncements , so to speak , describing the St Gotthard tunnel as the most important tunnel certainly in Europe if not in the world .
The European Union should not , however , be indifferent to what is happening in this the most populous country in Africa .
It is quite a sad matter for the European Union that Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which there is no cooperation agreement .
There are many different kinds of problems , but I will only refer to the problem of the flooding last weekend .
For a start , we must truly move away from the medical model of disability to the social and rights @-@ based model of disability .
The second important factor are the special policies on education and employment .
We respect the independence of the judiciary in Greece and the cooperation we have thus far been given from the Greek authorities , but when these people have already been in prison for three weeks without charge and now have a further two weeks before charges are brought , I hope you will agree that there is an urgent humanitarian need for an appeal on their behalf and also a need to remind the Greek authorities of their absolute duty under the Convention on Human Rights to bring charges before defendants .
The summit will stress the need to reiterate our determination to pursue the process launched at Lisbon and at Gothenburg .
That is only one of the many errors you have been propagating instead of a vision .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , there is one issue that you , yourself , said is still not resolved , which is to the issue known as &apos; cooling &apos; .
It would include , and this may not recommend itself to Mr Prodi or his staff , the idea of a specific regulatory assessment office in the office of the Commission Secretary @-@ General .
Here , too , the co @-@ legislator needs to be involved .
A great deal will need to be done about this in the coming years .
The European Parliament must be granted full legislative and budgetary powers .
It is extremely difficult to select who is the best spokesperson for a specific subject .
We might need a Europe @-@ wide review with a view to reinforcing those standards and we certainly need that in parallel with the European arrest warrant .
There is also a clear need to safeguard the individual &apos;s right to information , which he must be in a position to demand .
Progress continues to be made in the activities in the field of punishment .
The opposite is the case , we are giving the judicial system instruments to enable it to better protect everyone &apos; s freedom because , faced with the free movement of crime , we must open the doors to the free movement of justice .
However , we do want to underline that the term terrorism is to be defined as proposed by the European Parliament , for I am a little wary in that respect .
Whilst Parliament has responded speedily to the challenge , we believe that this should not lead to a lower level of parliamentary scrutiny and we reserve the right to amend in second reading the revised annex to this regulation adopted by the Council in its common position .
The course must be set for this as early as the Laeken Summit .
If you now ask what damage results , that is , of course , difficult to say .
The hotter burn of modern vehicle engines delivers higher efficiency and thereby cuts CO2 emissions .
Egypt is a friend .
The oral question to the Commission underlines this anxiety .
I believe that , as far as this aspect is concerned , we are in complete agreement with the Commission .
But I think the Commission knows all this very well and I am sure it respects it .
This is the main reason for our decision to increase our additional contribution to Macedonia by EUR 18 million .
Once again Mr President , I would like to call for the cancellation of Third World debt and for this money to be allocated to education , prevention and health . This is the right way to combat AIDS in the long term .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Fiori , for his excellent work .
He started , but then he refused to create a fiancée for him .
Sometimes we simply do not see it .
Ladies and gentlemen , the great area of debate between bioethics and law has been opened up , but it should not be approached from moralistic positions because the distinction is not between progressive secular people and conservative Catholics , that is a black @-@ and @-@ white , simplistic view , but rather between those who believe that science should be allowed to do anything , even if it goes against the dignity of life , and those who believe that that should not be possible .
Secondly , we must ensure that pharmaceutical companies communicate with the public .
Is there a right to life @-@ long health ?
In our present state of knowledge , many questions still remain open , even in purely scientific terms .
They are clearly addressing exactly the same issue using deliberately different language and I would have thought now that we have adopted Amendment No 10 , which I welcome , Amendment No 23 is no longer necessary .
Rapporteur Bouwman quite rightly proposes also bringing small independent sub @-@ contractors , homeworkers and domestic staff within the scope of this regulation , so that there are no loopholes if a malicious employer stops paying wages .
The Egyptian government must take measures to improve the situation of the 8 @-@ 10 million Coptic Christians in Egypt , who are discriminated against in legislation and in professional and social life , as well as in the practice of their religion .
On the pretext of fighting against terrorism , the European Commission is going ahead with proposals that it has already been working on , led by Commissioner Vitorino , who , far exceeding the necessary cooperation between States , is seeking to go ahead with the supranationalisation of fundamental aspects of justice .
. ( NL ) I welcome the establishment of Eurojust and , with it , the possible cooperation between public prosecutors from the various Member States .
The European Union has been a bulwark against recession in the past .
Mr President , the surprising result of the vote on the Fiori report can be interpreted in various ways .
I wanted to offer my support for research freedom , particularly for genetic research , into surplus embryonic stem cells , and although this type of research involves uncertainties and risks , it is very important that there be Community regulation and funding so that private research does not have a monopoly in this field .
If that were the sort of response a minister in the British Government gave to a member of the British House of Commons , he would deservedly be pilloried in that House .
Madam President , at the last part @-@ session in Brussels you very kindly said that you would write to the Greek authorities about the 12 British and two Dutch plane spotters who were arrested .
It is , therefore , the work of many hands and if this debate today is considered , calm and , I hope , rational it is because of the extent to which the three sides in the triangle of forces have attempted to come to an agreed conclusion by the time of this second reading debate , in order to expedite the introduction of the new authority itself .
In that case , we think it is incredibly important to assert the right to tougher rules for health and environmental reasons .
In this respect , I have to say that other parts of the world often do not have the luxury of aiming for the highest possible safety standards for food . Their priority is to collect sufficient food to survive .
Madam President , I recall that when President Prodi first offered me this particular portfolio in July 1999 he emphasised to me the importance of food safety during the life of this Commission .
Two points have emerged .
We are in this transitional phase , and we must aim for normality as quickly as possible , away from ex ante , towards ex post , to put it in simple terms .
I particularly welcome progress on Article 4 of the framework directive so that the principle of appeals against NRA decisions on the substance of an issue , not just on whether procedure has been followed correctly , has been accepted .
Even more importantly , I hope they will go some way , in our drive for the knowledge @-@ based society , towards lessening the divide there is between those who have access to information technology and those who do not .
Many Members of the European Parliament have raised the issue of digital television .
I echo his criticism that the report reached the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs far too late .
We must be clear in our own minds that we are dealing here with large quantities , and therefore with a lot of money - not the European Union &apos;s money , but that of our partners in the market .
Madam President , last night the Committee on Budgets and , I understand , the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy discussed this matter .
In the course of 2002 , but even more so in 2003 and 2004 ( and the same will apply to our successors in the years after that ) , we will have to bring about a genuine &apos; intellectual revolution &apos; .
It is important that we are able to respect the deadlines and agreements we are party to and , on that basis , you can organise the work as you see fit : by means of &apos; planning &apos; , &apos; programming &apos; , &apos; rolling on &apos; , or whatever you want .
People who are humiliated can one day deliver a vote of no confidence to the Commission .
And that institution must be the European Commission , Mr President .
The negotiations will aim to further improve market access and dismantle the different types of trade @-@ distorting aid .
As you know , the European Union too presented a raft of proposals on the most important non @-@ trade concerns , such as the environment , the development of rural regions , food security , consumer affairs , labelling and animal protection .
In substance , this is still not much and we can understand why some of the NGOs wanted a more ambitious agenda , one that included the social aspect in particular .
Since we are opposed to the agreement as such for the above reasons , we have voted against the legislative resolution .
I would like to stress , firstly , the need for the Commission to indicate clearly in future the degree to which forecasts of job creation actually materialise .
In my view , quite a few options are still left open .
The report is in my name because the person who has done all the work on this , the standing rapporteur for the financial perspective , Mr Colom i Naval , decided after a lot of consideration that he could not present it to Parliament .
The Commission &apos;s estimate of funds for this area is something quite new .
It truly seemed as if the members of the Council were , once again , behaving like little boys running riot with cap pistols , as I expressed it a number of years ago .
We believe that Commissioner Schreyer has found a good ally in this Parliament and that we have received good help from the Commissioner .
The poor economic situation in the frontier regions of the Member States may well get even worse after the new countries join the EU , because differing levels of funding - almost all get Objective 1 funding - will greatly favour the frontier regions of the acceding countries , some of which already possess better transport infrastructure than is to be found in the frontier regions of the Member States .
However , as you know , after the Commission &apos; s replies we are quite prepared to give up these reservations , although there are still some points , two in particular , that bother us .
Of all the various uses of the national accounting data of the ESA in the budgeting procedure , such as setting budgetary limits , calculating gross national product , setting the fourth resource etc . , the only thing that is affected by the modification is the determination of Member States &apos; payments to VAT @-@ based own resource .
Only two weeks ago in Parliament we saw huge tranches of her own report being deleted because they contained references to such a body .
The Commission recalls that Slovenia must achieve a high level of external border control upon accession .
Moreover , as poverty and lack of local opportunities are amongst the main reasons for children being trafficked , the poverty @-@ reduction approach of our development cooperation is a meaningful basis for attacking the problem .
What measures does the Commission intend to propose to ensure that accidents at the workplace are reported ?
Therefore , from the European standpoint , many NGOs were present and I heard no complaints about this issue , either before or during any of the many meetings that I had with these organisations .
It is also not the policy of the Council of Ministers and it does not reflect their views .
The core European demands will , though , also be included in the new round of negotiations .
The IMA was thrown out of the OECD window only to return through the WTO door .
Yet what have the developing countries gained from Doha ?
The criticism from some quarters has been that we , the rich part of the world , continue to exploit the developing countries with the help of our refunds on exports .
The idea of profitability is becoming more generalised .
The Council &apos;s common position proposes a budget of EUR 280 million .
It should be available before this directive becomes applicable .
In the 20th century , tangible elements , such as land , capital and labour , were the sources of economic development .
Terrorism does not declare itself before striking , terrorism is faceless and terrorism indiscriminately kills innocent civilians .
In the legislative field , framework decisions have been taken on protecting the euro against forgeries , money @-@ laundering , combating the trade in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children .
Furthermore , I believe it is imperative to point out that the Union &apos; s objectives with regard to the protection of citizens are not just consistent with the fundamental rights set out in the EU Charter but are based on these rights .
Europe has shown its capacity to act .
At the moment we are still in a preparatory phase .
I do believe that this House will have to insist , with the utmost consistency , on the isolation Italy has imposed on itself over the last few weeks being maintained by the 14other European states , because anyone who has , like me or like Mrs Paciotti , crossed swords in this House with Mr Berlusconi or Mr Dell &apos;Utri , will be painted by the Berlusconi press , as I was , as an old Stalinist - and I am not old yet , nor am I yet a Stalinist - or , like Mrs Paciotti , will be described as head of a communist conspiracy against Italy .
It would be excellent if the Commission and the Council could show that this is not the case .
Here again , however , we will have to clarify the rules on exchanges of personal data within the framework of mutual judicial assistance involving third countries .
Perhaps the Commissioner would like to repeat this part ?
A European programme of Community action in the field of public health can contribute to this .
Hazan report ( A5 @-@ 0414 / 2001 )
If the Palestinian Authority is disabled , we will face a situation of anarchy where Hamas and Jihad will no doubt gather increasing support and local extremist committees will compete in an escalation of violence .
It means that the European Union must be critical of both sides ; critical towards Israel with regard to her reoccupation of Palestinian areas , the erection of blockades and extrajudicial executions .
There is also light in that Mr Arafat has admitted , quite objectively , that the European Union &apos; s appeal is fair .
I am telling you this to clearly explain where the problem lies as far as the Council is concerned .
When will Parliament adopt its own security rules ?
That is right .
Subject : Informal European Council meeting in Ghent on the Laeken declaration On Wednesday , 4 July a representative of the Belgian Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office of the EU spoke in positive terms of the role of constitutional regions in the process of European integration .
That is all I can commit him and myself to .
The European Union will certainly use the monitoring process to follow this issue and , where applicable , to assess whether , on the one hand , the progress made in respecting the conditions and , on the other hand , the level of relations established and the level of technical and economic assistance are still appropriate .
I am really convinced that the coherence in this programme between democracy , economic development and security is an illustration of how conflict prevention has developed from a concept on paper to a very usable instrument in practice .
Mr President , I would firstly like to state that the majority of Members in our Group are in favour of this excellent report by Mr Lagendijk .
Let me be crystal clear . Nothing excuses or mitigates terrorism .
That will also give us a sounder basis , with real shared interests , for continuing and deepening our political dialogue with Iran on regional and international issues .
the report ( A5 @-@ 0440 / 2001 ) by Mr Watts , on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 95 / 21 / EC concerning the enforcement , in respect of shipping using Community ports and sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States , of international standards for ship safety , pollution prevention and shipboard living and working conditions ( port State control ) ( PE @-@ CONS 3657 / 2001 - C5 @-@ 0525 / 2001 - 2000 / 0065 ( COD ) ) ;
It should be done more quickly next time !
I see this as our task for the immediate future .
This time the European Union has demonstrated that we have taken the fight against marine pollution seriously .
All of us take the view that occupational pensions - among other areas - will require greater fiscal coordination .
There is , then , a need for a standard minimum regulation .
This voice that politicians and generals have tried to silence since man first walked this earth and since men have been waging war .
Today , with the confidence of the European Union , whose parliamentarians have placed the prestigious Sakharov Prize in our hands , I humbly call for a bilateral and simultaneous cease @-@ fire that will open the way to a cessation of hostilities , as we have called for so many times .
Section VIII ( B ) - European Data Protection Supervisor
The voting session that we have just completed is yet another perfect illustration of the frequently hemiplegic behaviour of the European Parliament .
I welcome moves to improve relations with Iran .
The summary he has given us certainly indicates the amount of work that has been done on that .
But Member States determine the practices , and we have to try to encourage adoption of the best practices amongst them .
Even in Europe we can and must act .
This is the reality .
Today we consume more than twice as much honey as we produce .
I really want to appeal to both the Commission and the Council to be crystal @-@ clear in their condemnation of Mugabe &apos; s regime and to state that our and the world community &apos; s patience is at an end .
This is the rationale of what we are doing at this moment .
A week ago , in Kabul , I saw de @-@ mining activities funded by ECHO .
With the end of the Taliban &apos;s reign of terror and its mediaeval regime in sight , the brutal suppression of women &apos;s rights will also come to an end .
The boy was sitting on the bus with his mother .
Witnessing it last Saturday will remain with me forever .
We are devastated that the attempt by our President , Nicole Fontaine , to meet President Eyadéma in Paris last week and ask him , as a favour , to arrange for this release , proved fruitless .
But we need to see these results , not least the early release of the many hundreds of political prisoners still held in Burmese jails .
These people have been plundered by cruel and corrupt dictators who continue to enrich themselves .
We do not want any legal wranglings about that .
The vote will be taken at 6.30 p.m .
In answer to your question , Mrs Buitenweg , the subject is solely the European arrest warrant .
For all of this , and for the excellent degree of cooperation between us , thank you very much !
The President of the Commission , Romano Prodi , with the Member of the Commission responsible for reforming the European Union , Michel Barnier , at his side , have not only constantly monitored our progress along the road to reform , they have also trodden the road with us .
Do not be overly disappointed .
Chairman Poettering reiterated the role played by our President in supporting Commander Massoud . Our own President had invited Mrs Sihem Ben Sedrine here today , who , once again due to despicable , base , mediocre action taken by this dictatorship , which is becoming increasingly dictatorial by the day , will not be able to attend the reception that the President of our Parliament had organised in her honour .
The idea that Europe might be condemned to being just a union of agriculture and trade or just a financial and monetary union is waning .
Where are the critics ?
The praesidium is going to play a dominating role in this respect and in that praesidium there will naturally be two representatives of the European Parliament .
We hope that , at least , once the Constitution has been drafted , it will be possible for both national parliaments and this House to amend it , where necessary , unlike the situation with the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I still want to say a word about governance and the reform of the Council .
Mainly thanks to the Belgian Presidency , the discussion on the future of Europe has been broadened to involve MEPs and it is becoming a public discussion .
I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for this , since throughout its mandate it has shown courage and vision , as well as the Commissioner responsible for these issues .
In view of the diseases among animals that have recently occurred in practically all Member States , Europeans have the right to expect Heads of State to do their utmost to ensure there is complete safety with regard to food .
Following the decisions taken by the Conference of Presidents on 10 January , a final draft agenda has been distributed .
I have learned here how good we are at legislating on and talking about equal opportunity and gender equality , but how bad we are sometimes as an institution at putting it into practice .
I am sure that whoever becomes our next President will know how to continue to foster this attentive , working atmosphere of democratic debate .
I thank Mr David Martin for the manner in which he has conducted his campaign for the issues which he has articulated and brought forward , which are of common concern and on which we must act .
( Applause )
In difficult situations , when he was told that he had two options , he used to reply : &apos; In that case , I choose the third . &apos; 
I congratulate each and every one of them on their election .
The situation is desperate and we must all intervene at once and do something about it .
We will continue with the election of the Quaestors at 12.30 p.m. , and by the same procedure .
As a fourth focus therefore , and on the basis of the Luxembourg Process in its current framework , the Barcelona European Council will seek a greater emphasis on the Employment Strategy in the analysis of the structural inflexibilities of our labour markets , in our tax and social protection systems and in the institutions of the labour market .
In other words , we need an active , not a passive approach to change .
Mr President , I imagine that all this commotion will not be counted as part of my speaking time .
In any case , I wish you a successful six month &apos; s work .
Mr President , Happy New Year to everybody and congratulations to our President .
To some extent , however , Spain will not break any new ground .
The liberalising agenda has become bogged down by new social and environmental targets .
It has other facets : basic social need and environmental impact .
The actual introduction of the euro is a red letter day for those of us who want to see European integration and economic development .
Lastly , we are aware that we must undertake a reform of the institutions , and we have , for this purpose , proposed the Convention and an Intergovernmental Conference .
He is Deputy Chairman of the Russian State Duma and Co @-@ Chairman of the EU @-@ Russia Parliamentary Cooperation Committee .
We must stay consistent on this point .
The banks and their staff have also contributed a great deal to the smooth transition .
The policy mix will be one of the key elements of the Spanish Presidency , as the chairman of Ecofin stressed and I am sure we will have the opportunity in this House to debate this fundamental point .
On the other hand , though , there must also be the guarantee that nobody tendering for a contract can gain unjustifiable advantages for himself .
That is at present not guaranteed in all the Member States under the threshold .
However , it should not be used to prevent the contracts from going ahead or as an extra bureaucratic layer to be put in place to prevent the best possible price from being brought forward .
However , we need amendments that include social and environmental requirements and equal treatment requirements in procedures .
By which I mean certain models of public procurement , such as electronic catalogues , electronic government purchasing methods and a series of corresponding electronic means used by companies .
However , those conclusions cannot prejudge the judgment itself .
In the Directive which has now been approved , the Member States are obliged to submit plans which will allow the limit values necessary for the protection of human health and of vegetation to be lowered by 2010 .
Any satisfaction or progress ?
The poor Commissioner wanted a slim programme and has ended up with a fatty !
The few overarching objectives the programme now contains are generally known , and so they should be .
We urgently need definite proposals for the promotion of environmentally friendly products .
Industry , too , should break new ground here .
How can it be feasible for the European Union to develop a common defence policy if it does not make available the technical resources for this domain ?
The Council proposed stretching this date even further until December 2020 , a modification the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism agreed with fully .
Furthermore , a proper exam will provide far more certainty that the driver has actually learnt what he thinks he has learnt .
I urge colleagues to reject the Grosch report .
However , the agreement does stress with good reason the importance of the participation of players other than the local government , such as NGOs and the private sector .
But this will be in line with their level of development and will take into account the socio @-@ economic impact of trade measures .
And furthermore , we are holding the debate on a Thursday , which is not usual for fisheries , and the reports will be voted on on a Thursday morning .
Let us , by the end of this year , find a common and sustainable solution in the interests of our European fisheries .
In a 1997 report the Parliamentary Research Service noted that the only examples of successful management systems were to be found in the Falkland Islands , Iceland , Namibia and New Zealand , where fisheries fall within a single jurisdiction .
Fishermen feel that , even when two identical mistakes are made , the penalties imposed are different .
In my earlier speech I was unable to take the time to do so .
There are unfortunately too many food scandals , and it is therefore also important for us to point out that the fisheries sector is as a rule the victim and that it has not been possible subsequently to prove that it is this sector that is liable for the scandals or occurrences in question .
As you know , pensioners and elderly people , who enjoy a spot of sightseeing and visiting the beautiful cities of Europe when they are in good health , often travel by coach .
On the pretext of simplifying and updating existing Community legislation , the rapporteur hopes to create a genuine , liberalised single European market in the water , energy and transport sectors .
García @-@ Orcoyen Tormo report ( A5 @-@ 0419 / 2001 )
I know that a large number of fish are getting together to form the &apos; Fish Green Party &apos; , for fish have the right to live in a clean environment , just as we do .
Training and recruitment of seafarers
Madam President , I should like to insist emphatically that this statement be made and I do not think that it should take very long .
Of course further important work remains to be done before the third consultative document is published later in the year .
( The sitting was closed at 5.10 p.m. )
This is the spirit in which the Olympic truce , the fundamental principle behind the Olympic Games , was born in the eighth century .
We are able to accept Amendments Nos 32 and 36 .
In Laeken , the Heads of State and Government asked us to approve the framework decision on the harmonisation of penalties at European level for drug trafficking by the end of May of this year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank not only the Commission and you , Commissioner Vitorino , for the even @-@ handed presentation on long @-@ term residence by third @-@ country nationals , but also Baroness Ludford , the rapporteur , for the close cooperation .
Once again we are going to defend the right for third @-@ country nationals who are long @-@ term residents to vote in local and European elections .
Thanks to European funding , people who are hit by war or natural disasters in Bangladesh , Afghanistan , Somalia and the Balkans are helped to get back on their feet .
For example , ECHO is currently putting the finishing touches to guidelines for its exit strategies .
One of the aspects which the Commission is apparently verifying is whether foreign hauliers are subject to stricter monitoring than domestic hauliers , the latter being of one &apos; s own nationality .
If we succeed in doing that , we will already have achieved a great deal .
Mr President , this is a good time to thank the other groups in the House for their valuable contribution and for their help in ensuring that Parliament &apos; s amendments improve this important legislative text .

In Laeken it was agreed that the EIB would carry out a study to create a financial instrument or institution which would guarantee that , in terms of the cooperation between the European Union and the third countries of the Mediterranean , the level of use of resources responds to the effectiveness and possibilities for development cooperation that the situation demands .
Therefore , I believe that this issue warrants more profound analysis .
Like the Council , we have three months in which to do this , in which respect we are given equivalence with them .
The health of the European economy depends on this legislation .
All these are highly significant benefits to the ordinary people who elected us to serve on their behalf .
Commissioner Bolkestein told us that we must not discuss the sex of angels , but that &apos; equivalence &apos; obviously means equivalence between Parliament and the Council .
Parliament had , in fact , called for this sort of harmonisation in the past , but it was clear from the last vote that the new Parliament voted in took a different view and in 1996 and 1999 , Commissioner , the rapporteurs voted against the Commission proposal .
Indeed , adopting the Commission &apos; s proposal , we would ultimately have made the legislation too inflexible and created great difficulties , particularly for the manufacturing sector , with the result that the cost of national production - especially in southern Europe - would have increased and its quality decreased .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
The rejection of the improvements by the Left necessitates my rejecting the entire package , unfortunately including a few sound proposals made by the rapporteur .
That is good , I am in favour of that .
It was a terrible tragedy that violence should have broken out again in January .
The situation is still not perfect , but I believe we will be able to spend the Spring in peace and calm .
We reject that appellation with all the decisiveness we have .
There is a second - Mr Sharon .
Since the last resolution we approved in the European Parliament , with the majority support of the parliamentary groups , there have evidently been more terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians .
I would remind you that this statement called for the immediate and unconditional implementation of the Tenet plan and of the recommendations of the Mitchell committee , and reiterated our conviction , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , that establishing an impartial monitoring mechanism would serve the interests of both parties .
Nor do I think that we , the European Union , are mere bystanders doomed , like Sisyphus , to roll the boulder to the top of the mountain and then watch others toss it back over the edge .
Moreover , the Commission has decreed , through this draft regulation , that a reasonable period of notice must be given before the cancellation of a contract , in most cases two years .
This should cause us to be concerned for the consumer .
Who bears the costs ?
This is obviously no guarantee that everyone in the end will choose the same approach , but I hope that we can at least agree together policies in an open and transparent way and that before the first State starts dividing up the spectra the rules will be known to all .
Mr Alavanos &apos;s question concerns the Lisbon targets and whether or not Greece will be able to attain them .
In 1997 the Commission presented a proposal to the Council to extend the scope of this regulation to workers who are third @-@ country nationals .
Give us some hope that it will happen .
The report constitutes yet further evidence of the competence for which our young colleague has , in a short time , acquired a reputation in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , as also for the industriousness shown by the quality of her work .
I am personally confident that an agreement between the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission will be achieved on these issues .
I would therefore also permit myself to ask you a question , Mr Monti . How does this proposal fit in with our general desire to cut back on state aid and create a situation in which we can all compete fairly and on an equal basis ?
On the whole , my colleagues fully support these measures , which must enable us to achieve the objective of food safety .
Incidentally , the special purchases programme , set up by the Commission is about to be abolished , on 31 March , and according to Agenda 2000 , the intervention mechanism for beef and veal is due to end on 30 June 2002 .
I remember the long hours of debate , the on @-@ site inspections carried out at the beginning of the committee of inquiry &apos; s work and then during the work of the supervisory committee monitoring the committee of inquiry , set up because Parliament did not have confidence even in the information provided by the Commission ; in effect , it proved to be severely lacking in many areas .
At this stage I should summarise the key measures that have been put in place .
We need , in the future , to stick together not only in theory but also in practice .
The prospects for this are fairly good , given the way things look at present , particularly in Japan .
So when you wish to communicate something you need to pick your moment and you cannot pick a moment which on that day belongs to someone else .
I want over the next period to try to sell our story better than we have done in the past .
Our group has always wished for struggle , for we have an appetite for change .
He is accountable to this Parliament - we should not overlook that .
That is something which , I am afraid , will become more and more a feature of your presidency , but we will have more and more occasion to take hard decisions .
I am now quite confident that there will be a majority next month in favour of a useful package of reforms that will not solve all our problems - far from it - but will be a useful step forward .
There is no greater risk to the freedom of thought , of expression and to the right to life itself , than violence expressed through terrorism .
We have to take some things on trust , but I would be reluctant to take all on trust .
History has shown that human beings can be extraordinarily cruel if their actions go unpunished .
I should like to take this opportunity to thank the previous Presidencies of the Union for the considerable effort they have made throughout this process , since it has been a gradual process to bring us up to the point we have now reached .
Learning from experience and improved international coordination can make development cooperation more effective .
Our clear position is that , in the future too , unanimity shall be required in connection with decisions on taxes , and this in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty .
Today &apos; s document addresses this subject - which has already been dealt with in the past - in a number of respects , it develops and analyses it and also welcomes in principle the decline of that aid during the period 1997 to 1999 .
The first is the demand for development aid .
Zimbabwe is the most clear example of this .
The EU can no longer , then , hide behind the Americans .
The provisions of Title V of the Treaty on European Union require the Member States to observe the principles of coordination and mutual solidarity when defining and implementing the CFSP , so this democratic and parliamentary deficit must be corrected .
The report does not mention that the European Parliament is merely an assembly with implementing powers and that the national parliaments alone have full sovereignty .
We also hope to see greater involvement by the national Parliaments in the political and legislative process of the European Union , and we are , therefore , committed to helping establish conditions for the effective national monitoring of each government in their capacity as a Member of the Council of the Union .
The first is the increase in effectiveness and results .
This is literally the chronicle of a death foretold .
The case she mentions is but one more on the list of horrors and suffering experienced by many human beings in Afghanistan , children and adults , men and women .
The European Union has also expressed its support for the efforts of the Member States of the Union which , on the request of the Colombian Government and the parties in conflict , are taking part in the talks which the President , Andrés Pastrana , has entered into with the ELN and FARC in order to reach a negotiated solution to the conflict .
Nevertheless , I would like to remind you that it is common practice in all Islamic countries to apply the Sharia , the Islamic law .
As Mr Papayannakis no doubt knows , the European Union has been playing an active role in the negotiations with the ad hoc group of States which are parties to the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons and in the 5th review conference , held in Geneva from 19 November to 7 December 2001 .
It is in the light of this reminder that I must examine certain proposals that you have put forward , Mr Pohjamo .
There are actually rather different views in my group regarding how that can be addressed .
That is why I will vote against recitals O and R of Mr Musotto &apos;s report .
This policy is the proof that the European Union is not merely a supermarket ; that it will , one day , I hope , be a political power and that it must remain a community that stands together .
It is enough to imagine a road on which vehicles are maintaining the same speed .
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 0005 / 2002 ) by Mr Glante , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , on the Proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of the Galileo Joint Undertaking ( COM ( 2001 ) 336 - C5 @-@ 0329 / 2001 - 2001 / 0136 ( CNS ) ) .
It is not a question of deciding whether or not to approve the Galileo project . This has already been decided in the report by Mrs Langenhagen , as she herself has just pointed out , and I myself gave a favourable opinion on behalf of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
There is evidence of entrepreneurship in the Maghreb , but the lack of financing and credit facilities tends to block women &apos;s initiatives .
However , there is still much progress to be made .
Illiteracy , understood to mean either a lack of basic education or &apos; returning &apos; illiteracy , is causing an increasing divide between those who are privileged and enjoy relative security and those who are disadvantaged and marginalised , who do not have access to work , who are in danger of isolation and do not participate in social life .
Commissioner , Nice has provided you with a valuable tool .
Lastly , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Marie @-@ Therèse Hermange and her colleagues in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for including in the report proposals that I tabled , specifically on asking the Commission to adopt initiatives and to present an action plan for the effective prevention of musculoskeletal injuries at work , to take initiatives to provide appropriate safeguards for workers &apos; rights , and notably employment , in the event of the restructuring or relocation of undertakings and to take initiatives , and notably adopt an action plan , to put into practice equality of payment for men and women .
Many of us believe that is a very important question .
From an institutional point of view , it is clear that a project on which there is Europe @-@ wide cooperation would be justified with regard to subsidiarity , and that the European Space Agency ( ESA ) could provide the appropriate instrument for this .
The organisation in the occupied territories , of elections based on the theme of peace would act , however , as a lever that would force the Palestinians to adopt a clear position with regard to the Intifada and terrorism .
If a decision is made which clashes with their national public opinion , they can always say that they themselves wanted things differently , but that it was the neighbours that prevented this from happening .
They are certainly no more or less macho than men from Northern States .
Madam President , on 13 December last year an appalling and vicious attack occurred on the parliament of the Indian Union in Delhi , which is their most visible symbol of democracy and secular nationhood .
I therefore want to put your minds at rest in a way , but the measures announced by the European Parliament are absolutely vital .
In endorsing this request , we will be taking a very sensible step which will also help to advance the fight against terrorism .
The European Union has a long @-@ standing ongoing dialogue with the United States on human rights issues and in the field of justice and home affairs .
That is why it is essential that the two candidates agree to the ballot being checked and that the High Constitutional Court agrees to compare the results .
We hope that , at that forum , we will be able to debate the processes announced previously as having already taken place , and that we will be able to find a way to initiate a peace process with the Eritreans as well , to restore democracy and , most importantly , to restore to the citizens , men , women and children acceptable living conditions which are no longer shameful .
Amendment No 2 , proposing an additional clarifier , which is not intended to replace , but to clarify and extend the content of the paragraph , also by means of concepts and definitions which guarantee the application of the Directive , faithful to the idea that things should be judged by what they are and not what they are called .
I know she will be speaking on behalf of Mr Liikanen .
But we need to get freight through unfettered .
The first and most important solution , the fundamental solution is , of course , to have a much more generous and more balanced development policy .
However , if enlargement is to be a total success , we must also give a high profile to the other two priorities I mentioned just now .
It will not be easy because the candidate countries are not , of course , as yet in a position to decide who their future Commissioners will be , and the rules are not yet quite clear .
I am disappointed because Parliament has been waiting since last summer for this proposal to come on the table , and I am a bit embarrassed because it seemed that it was almost finished and ready to be published , but last Monday &apos;s Financial Times has since published an article with a lot of press complaint against this proposal .
It does make it important that I should acknowledge that both Members strenuously affirm their innocence and denounce what they consider to have been abusive elements in the prosecution process .
The Laeken European Council welcomed the choice of environmental indicators , for the monitoring of the implementation of the sustainable development strategy , and also welcomed the progress made in relation to the European ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .
In this respect , the review relating to the economic evolution of the Member States shows that some , politically , have been hunted hunters .
Situations such as that in California can still be prevented by intervening in the Commission &apos; s plans in good time .
For them , 11 September might well have been an opportunity , if they had gone about it in a credible way , to do what global politics has not been able to do so far , that is , to unreservedly support human rights .
What Barcelona is mainly about , of course , is consolidating and developing the EU countries &apos; share of world economic domination .
Fourthly , additional adverse consequences for the economic situation , such as the rapporteur fears , might be brought about by increased expenditure on the armed forces and on internal security , can be drastically minimised by a sensible policy of development , which would focus on removing such causes of terrorism as poverty , oppression , exploitation and cultural intolerance .
It is vital that we learn from this crisis for the future .
The candidate countries have been mentioned .
In 2002 , the Commission will be concentrating its efforts on two aspects , firstly on increasing awareness of the Criminal Court , as part of which it wants to call on more than the necessary sixty countries to proceed with ratification , so that the statute can enter into force , whilst , at the same time , wanting to ensure that all areas of the globe are represented .
I would also mention the decision to create a commission , comprising of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs and Human Rights , to supervise the situation at field level of the protection of human rights and adopt the necessary measures .
What Parliament stands by is this : We campaign for the cultural rights of the Kurds - rights that are inalienable , that do not amount to separatism or terrorism , that do not create difficulties for Turkey , but which could be the salvation of Turkey as a European country .
I wish also to thank , in particular , Mrs McCarthy and Mr Harbour and also Mr Carraro .
This is a state of affairs that we cannot accept .
I should like to make it clear that I am speaking primarily on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Just as often , however , there are worrying reports concerning , for example , an escalation in Georgian protests on the border with Abkhazia , increased tension on the border between Georgia and Chechnya and the cessation of the Armenian @-@ Azerbaijani discussions at presidential level following the Key West Summit in April of last year .
As Mr Gahrton said , the underlying question concerns these nations &apos; future prospects , and the Commission in particular - with the complicity of the Council , as usual - is refusing to offer any enticing political prospects to these countries and seems to reject the view that the only criterion for membership of the European Union is the fact that the people of a particular country feel European at heart .
The other part of my report focuses on promoting cycling and walking within the bounds of subsidiarity .
Clearly , we could go into the other issue in greater detail .
What impact do they have , for example , on teacher training ?
Do you know what we have achieved with Socrates , quite apart from the tangible results ?
For example , how does this programme give our citizens improved access to and participation in culture ?
It is also important for us to ensure that projects are not rejected for purely formal reasons , and that we have to provide opportunities for small structures , another issue on which there were complaints .
As regards suggestions for the future , I should first like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Graça Moura , for encouraging us to look to the future .
The young people involved gained so much and to see them speaking here in Brussels , some of whom were previously young offenders , highlighted to me the importance of this programme .
- ( FR ) I would like to make three comments with regard to the financing of the Convention that will prepare for the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference . Firstly , the representatives from the Member States have succeeded in putting together a complicated arrangement , when it could have been much simpler ; secondly , this complexity will backfire on them ; and thirdly , it will be so much harder to implement because essential expenditure has visibly not been included .
Unfortunately , the Bullman report continues on this wrong path of confusing &apos; social &apos; with &apos; capital &apos; but , according to the Right , this is not yet taking things far enough .
Obviously a lot of people , including in this Chamber , deliberately talk of progress in Turkey , knowing that , to all intents and purposes , there is no progress or that , in certain sectors , things have got worse .
I think that Parliament is being held hostage to a few Stalinists , who always take a strong line with those who are weak and are weak in the face of those who are strong .
On the 18th of this month - and I repeat , if we do nothing to prevent it - we will once again see barbaric television pictures of a person buried up to their waist and then stoned to death .
It has room for respect for human values and societies in preference to commercial interests .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Fidel Castro said that opposing globalisation is akin to questioning the force of gravity - both are futile .
When the Commission analysed these issues - which is the reason why I have jointly presented its three reports - it reached the conclusion that the concept of globalisation must include , as a minimum , the elements which relate to the existence of an international financial system which works efficiently , development aid systems and the elements relating to the environment and sustainable development .
We should also not neglect radio as a good way of getting information .
I would like to confine myself to asking the Commission the following .
So we have a good result , both for those worried about losing the universal service and for those who wanted to advance the single market and widen consumer choices .
And if it risked using Article 86 anyhow , the Convention would have to redefine Europe &apos;s objectives with full background knowledge of the situation .
That will be the case only in 2006 .
Many people , myself included , were unhappy about the unreasonably high salary of the supervisor , which will of course be comparable to that of the Ombudsman .
Amendments Nos 12 and 16 contain excellent ideas but the present decision &apos;s legal base of Article 43 , Regulation 45 / 2001 , is not sufficiently large to carry them .
I hope that , by means of this dialogue , we will discuss our political priorities for 2003 , in order to define concrete courses of action for the enlarged Europe .
I am convinced that no one in this Parliament wishes to jeopardise the enlargement timetable for reasons of this kind .
If we are to maintain the ceilings as they are , the only ways we can pay for increased responsibilities are either through the increasing use of flexibility instruments - and we have reservations about that - or quite simply through cuts in other lines .
I am sure that we will be able , by the end of the year , to present a sound Budget .
Furthermore , there is reason for great concern with regard to the Commission &apos;s policy .
For next year , the situation of categories 3 , 4 and 5 is very worrying ; we have already mentioned it : we are very close to the upper limit and in category 5 we are really above it .
The Union &apos;s budget must reflect this confidence and contribute to strengthening the policies of the States aimed at full employment , solidarity and economic growth .
So far - and here I fully agree with my fellow MEP , Mr Rapkay - this has not been satisfactorily resolved in any Member State .
Making room for new players in the renewable energies market is justified . Attacking the nuclear industry and the national assets of our neighbours is not .
It has been a complex subject . We have had to separate two directives - the one on gas and the one on electricity - and we have had to do a lot of work very quickly .
I am pleased that Parliament - and specifically the two rapporteurs - is taking the approach contained in the Commission proposal , particularly with regard to the dates for opening up the market , the separation of the operators of the networks and the competences of the regulatory authorities , which are crucial elements in terms of the correct operation of the system .
The Council always reduces the level of the budget artificially .
On the other hand , it does not actually make any sense - we are not in any trouble - to curtail the parliamentary procedure , because I think that in the USA they will recognise that parliamentary procedures take time .
Mr President , Mrs de Palacio , pollution abatement is a noble but difficult struggle , a delicate balance between economic prosperity and human welfare .
However , on a smaller scale too , there are women across the world who are being oppressed , abused or discriminated against in the name of religion .
We must make an effort to reach agreement and we need to keep an open and tolerant mind on this matter .
Islam is the second most important religion in the European Union today .
We have seen this in relation to this proposal on noise and the parallel proposal on vibration .
The Commission also rejects Amendment No 21 , because it feels that the manner in which the Member States obtain access to the relevant medical and scientific advice is a question of subsidiarity .
Nothing in Romania &apos;s system of international adoptions could possibly remain as it was .
If possible , could the Commission make resources available to make sure this woman has proper legal representation to guarantee that she has a fair hearing and that every resource is utilised to save her life ?
On 2 May 2000 the Commission requested information from the Greek authorities regarding the measures taken to comply with the Court ruling , but no information was provided .
The problem is that , when in use , it emits materials that are absorbed partly into our blood , partly into our layers of fat and partly into mother &apos;s milk .
What do you think the prospects for employment are for the 2000 or so families who made a living from tobacco ?
In my view , we should also remind ourselves sometimes that the European Union alone imports more agricultural products from the developing countries than the USA , Japan , Canada , New Zealand and Australia put together .
My only objection is that , because most of the world &apos;s biological diversity exists in tropical areas in the developing countries , I should like to have seen the development aspect given a rather more prominent place in the report .
Drawing up national strategies or action plans on biodiversity could only be contemplated if they were drafted after a broad consensus had been reached , respecting regional socio @-@ economic interests .
The company behind this campaign is engaging in image @-@ making at the expense of the sick .
The fact is too that the EU is not allowed to introduce harmonisation on public health issues . This is clearly stated by the Treaties .
Mr President , last year in Britain alone , 5 000 people died from overdosing on alcohol .
Opponents shift the blame onto the pharmaceutical industry on the grounds that it wants to sell more tablets .
I am happy to take comfort from Mr Nisticò &apos;s contribution on the basis that he is certainly one of the MEPs I know here who is a scientist himself .
We are speaking about a second reading , which the rapporteur has prepared brilliantly , and I admire the way in which Mrs Paulsen has tried to navigate a course between Scylla and Charybdis , Scylla being the thirteen Member States that have accepted the common position , and Charybdis being the two that have not , namely Austria and Germany .
I am unable to support the proposed amendments to the regulations governing post @-@ mortem inspection of blood , for which I do not believe there is any scientific justification .
Mr President , this proposal is the second major component in our defence barriers against BSE .
I urge the Commission to examine , as a matter of urgency , whether this task cannot be simplified , perhaps by means of standardised returns .
Nonetheless , we are also convinced that it does not have to be the prime mover in finding that solution . The European Union , the United States , Russia and the United Nations must work together .
The real problem will be the growing socio @-@ economic gulf between Poland and Lithuania on the one hand and the Kaliningrad region on the other , which will ensue if a way cannot be found to make possible Kaliningrad &apos;s involvement in the region &apos;s increasing economic dynamism .
We must welcome those who wish to join us as soon as they are ready .

We have simply not done our homework , but have saddled those other countries with these tasks instead - which they are implementing - and we complain in the meantime .
Consequently the nature of these two budgetary authorities will be very different .
The time @-@ scales vary from country to country , but it is our declared aim to ensure that all of them will in due course be in a position to apply for membership of the European Union .
Mr President , it is understandable that Europeans and Americans sometimes have different views on major international issues , but that must not hold back our commitment to try to act together , and I shall give you an example that I think demonstrates this clearly : the Monterrey Conference .
We have to act jointly in the Middle East , Afghanistan and the Balkans ; it is to be hoped that the United States will reconsider their position on Kyoto and especially with regard to certain worrying announcements by the Bush Administration .
However , the ubiquitous Dr Rath - wherever he is , and I suspect he is in this House - has carefully changed the message regularly as it comes through , making it very difficult for our services to block these e @-@ mails .
However , even if this oral amendment is defeated by the required majority - and I am saying this now so that I do not have to speak again later on - we can still vote on these amendments , because this date does not tie the Commission &apos;s hands .
It is all the more regrettable , as is so often the case , that the Commission &apos;s position is , in essence , perfectly unilateral and open to dispute .
Some Members of this House took a ridiculous approach in saying I should be recommending that people eat more oranges and vegetables .
In establishing the single market , which is its stated aim , the report on cross @-@ border exchanges in electricity seeks , first and foremost , to open the market in electricity to competition and de facto , even if it does not admit it openly , to privatisation .
But these are not the same phenomenon at all .
When it comes to analysing the significance of 11 September , on the other hand , a considerable gulf is developing between the two sides of the Atlantic , with one side regarding it as an isolated operation and the other as a manifestation of the new global terrorist scene , dominated by hyperterrorism .
Knowing all this , why would President Bush take this irrational decision ?
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Commissioner , in the wake of 11 September the United States seemed to want to engage in a policy of broad partnership on an international scale .
You will be aware that the legal opinion provided by Parliament &apos;s Legal Services felt that Articles 42 and 308 of the Amsterdam Treaty , as initially proposed by the Commission , formed the appropriate legal base for this extension as well as for the regulation as a whole .
Please note - an update .
Our Committee wished to adhere to the principle of coordinating national policies , which it sees as one of the mandatory precepts of the Stability Pact .
Anyone who follows the politico @-@ economic debate in the European Union will see that it is greatly concerned with rules , control , prohibitions , cohesion , coordination , discipline and such like .
Let me make it quite clear that the proposal from the Commission is a sound document . It resolutely addresses the key problems .
In the von Wogau report on comitology we also introduced the area of market participants , and I believe that there was very good cooperation in the area in which I was shadow rapporteur for the financial conglomerates , between the Commission , the Council , market participants and Parliament , especially in the preparatory phase .
I think that he can put the questions that we have asked him to the Presidency and to the Council and say that he is not in a position to answer some of them at present .
In Europe , there are more than one hundred peoples and more than one hundred different languages .
The Community position consists of setting up additional reductions to export subsidies , such as export credits , state trading enterprises or other kinds of export monopolies that use one market to subsidise another ; or even specific practices regarding food , whose true objective is to eliminate surpluses and open markets or suppress competition in the markets .
Very briefly , the question which I had on the Order Paper today has been dealt with by Mr de Miguel in an extremely courteous , helpful and kind letter to me , which I received this afternoon .
We need just as much information on SMEs as we do on large companies .
Secondly , I cannot accept including minority interests in group capital - that is , the last sentence of Amendment No 15 - if all the risks in the group are not also covered .
Tax competition , as has been pointed out by the Nobel prize @-@ winner , Robert Mundell , one of the recognised fathers of the single currency , does not run counter even to the introduction of the euro .
I am therefore of the opinion that the permanent solution for these problems requires enhanced approximation of rates to a level at which the above effects no longer occur or are brought back to a sustainable level .
Public opinion and all countries that have relations with Europe are convinced that their relations are with an autonomous and unitary system .
As a result there is the question of funding .
The credibility of our cooperation with ACP countries , which is far from negligible , is in doubt if it is not accompanied by reforms and the strengthening of the institution that is the most representative of the association , that is to say , the Joint Assembly .
They can also take an economic and social role in companies or associations .
They need policies to be implemented .
It also has a part to play in regional planning , as it is one of the few activities keeping people on the land in places where other forms of agriculture are not viable . As most of the producer regions in the European Union are disadvantaged , it has economic and social significance too .
In other words , do all those who maintain that , if we grub up tobacco farms in Europe , we shall help reduce smoking , mean to tell us that we need to grub up vineyards in order to fight alcoholism ?
The Fund must of course continue to serve its purpose and pursue research into varieties more suited to demand and causing as little harm as possible . Obviously it must also investigate alternative uses for raw tobacco and its environmental impact .
Admittedly , these are raw materials which the EU fleet cannot supply , which is why we need to improve conditions and guarantee security of supply .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , once again in this House we are debating European regional diversity ; in this case , the dimension of remoteness , as a result of the report by Mr Lage , whom I congratulate on his work , and which affects one of the most characteristic sectors of production in the outermost regions : fisheries .
When did the &apos; honourable &apos; Member receive this compromise amendment ?
The EU has been unable to solve this cross @-@ border problem for the past 13 years .
Added to this is the fact that Commission document COM ( 2001 ) 264 of 15 May 2001 on sustainable development stresses that &apos; political leaders should determine the pros and cons for other political contexts and take them into account .
This crisis has once again brought the antagonism within the international imperialist system and the more general conflict between the centres of imperialism vying for hegemony to the surface .
Mr Duff mentioned the need for the Union to become a fully contracting party on the international stage .
The Commission is also supporting the work of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Colombia .
Finally , I hope that a government of national unity , involving the opposition , will be set up .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , obstruction by the government notwithstanding , the European Union was able to follow the elections in Zimbabwe very closely and I should like to start by expressing my immense admiration of numerous people in Zimbabwe for their civil courage and for standing by their democratic convictions under such difficult circumstances .
Human rights , freedom of the press , freedom of expression , etc. are continuously violated .
In a speech that he gave on that occasion , Mr Prodi stated that the negotiations related to trade and cooperation .
This would give momentum to the reconciliation process and pave the way for reconstruction measures .
Terrorist acts are always vile and in this instance the attack also was clearly targeted .
Nonetheless , this did not prevent the Council from dealing with other matters , regarding the European Union &apos;s foreign policy , and other institutional matters .
They are also ready to play their part in carrying out an annual review of this overall economic strategy .
You succeeded admirably on both counts .
I do not have the percentages for what the ministers see . However , I know that legislative power belongs with the electorate and elected representatives , but that in the EU it has been seized by officials and their changing ministers .
There are two further points from that text which I would like to emphasise .
In my view , a reasonable balance between the desirable and the possible was struck at Barcelona . The European Union will now be able to make progress .
My final point relates to the call on the Commission to produce a regulation for a block exemption for services of general interest in the event that the European Court may find such support for services of general interest to be in breach of competition law .
Afterwards , they made triumphal assessments .
I would like to see him advocate unequivocally Ireland &apos;s participation in Partnership for Peace and not play this duplicitous game .
At this point we cannot properly prepare for enlargement without more staff .
The convention may unleash a few more but I am glad to see that those wretched shopping lists have gone at the first blast .
Thirdly , we can at least be pleased about the section on interinstitutional cooperation .
On this issue , the European Parliament is forfeiting the perspective of the people , and that is a serious matter .
Mr Puerta , may I assure you that there is no intention of losing Question Time to the Commission .
Mr President , with reference to the Israeli @-@ Palestinian question , I would like to draw your attention and that of the Members to the fact that our fellow Member , Mrs Morgantini , who went to the occupied territories with a delegation of members of the Italian parliament and Italian trade unionists , was seized and used as a human shield by the Israeli army .
Officers could not read it because it was not in English , and they could not act on it because the information did not allow for any further action due to prosecution or conviction .
Although Poland is not currently a member of the EU , but hopes to be before too long , it was clear that there was much work which still had to be done in an attempt to produce a more cooperative effect between the different law enforcement authorities .
What is at issue here is a programme on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union .
Mr President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Di Lello Finuoli and Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten on their excellent work on uniting efforts to create instruments that will enable us to combat the increasing volume and the frequent cross @-@ border effects of crimes against the environment .
If the machinery of mere sanctions is not sufficient , it must be possible to bring the big stick of the criminal law to bear - only , of course , in important and exceptional cases and with due regard for the division of secondary responsibilities , both in matters of environmental protection and - indeed , above all - in matters of criminal law .
We otherwise find ourselves increasingly lost in a thicket of innumerable and different regulations on judicial cooperation in criminal matters .
Mr President , cross @-@ border surveillance is a strictly regulated procedure , which enables the police officers of one Member State who are keeping a suspect under surveillance , to continue their work , if necessary , by crossing a border into another Member State , having made a request to the latter for assistance .
I want to praise the rapporteur for the work he has put in and for the sensitivity he has shown .
We are going to have to face up sooner rather than later to the need to have an immigration route as well as an asylum route into the EU , as well as tackling the traffickers .

Moreover , almost half of them were from Malawi , and it turned out that these were to be deducted from the number of audits , leaving 52 and not , as Mr Nielson had promised us in the committee , 73 .
The city of Strasbourg and the Alsace Region have the controlling interest in SERS , owning 60 % of the shares in all .
I have , in fact , nothing to add to Mr McCartin &apos;s description of the positive development on the revenue side .
In 1999 there was a substantial under @-@ spend on that and I am pleased to see that in 2000 it was almost fully committed including the overhang from 1999 .
Mr President , for the first time in many years , it looks as if this Parliament will once again be granting discharge to the Commission by 30 April , as prescribed .
For goodness &apos; sake , spare us the embarrassment of being haunted by this scandal , because if we must be haunted by a scandal - I assure you , Eluned - we can all drag up past scandals all over again .
One is the issue of the large surplus that remains .
As far as we are concerned , the scope of the Agency may be broad , starting with certifying aircraft types , then extending the scope to include other elements , such as training .
As you are well aware , as this point has been highlighted throughout this debate , European industry is hoping that this Agency will be able to issue a certificate for its next star product : the Airbus 380 .
I voted against the Oomen @-@ Ruijten report which supports the Commission &apos;s ambition to include , in the list of Community responsibilities in the area of environmental protection , the definition of the principle of criminal sanctions against offenders .
I am nonetheless aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark , cf. the Protocol on Denmark &apos;s position .
Hence one of the difficulties , Mr President , in including the contribution of European military capabilities to defending against external terrorism , when necessary , which is connected to the main priority of the Spanish Presidency , which is the fight against terrorism and which , nevertheless , in the current state of development of our missions as a result of the principle of evaluation , we cannot undertake without a prior Council declaration which I will refer to later if there is time .
This is true also of arms policy .
They are : progress on ESDP paving the way for harmonising the demand in Europe for defence equipment and , in parallel , the gradual recognition of the need to harmonise the rules and regulations which affect the competitiveness of the industries once restructured .
It should be added that , since 11 September , we have all been more keenly aware that a new definition of defence is needed , one which combines internal and external security .
The argument that this would benefit European security and defence policy cuts no ice .
I believe that today &apos;s debate may be a great help to the policy which the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council intends to pursue , because there is a slight discrepancy between his views and those of many of the participants : the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has insisted on the intergovernmental nature of the defence policy and here - on the one hand Mr Brok and , on the other , various other Members such as Mr Titley , Mr Marset , Mr Morillon , etc . , and Commissioners Patten and Liikanen - have indicated that there are elements for a European policy in the field of the arms industry .
I have been able to do this on many occasions , on the many trips I have made in recent months - as the honourable Members know - with the security leaders of the Palestinian Authority .
( Applause )
We cannot stand by while United Nations resolutions are flouted by an aggressive policy of settlements and a refusal to seek peace .
We must be all the more attentive as there is a risk that this situation could have consequences in our countries , where we are beginning to see confrontations between representatives of various communities .
Unless the root causes of conflict are addressed , no peaceful solution can be secured between the opposing sides .
We need to make demands of both sides .
That is the difficult question that we have been working on for many months .
I hope that the Erika rapporteurs together can meet the Commissioner soon to help bring forward proposals as to how best Parliament can ensure that Member States comply with their toughened obligations .
We take the view , unlike Mr Lehne , that a European patchwork quilt , where each court provides a different interpretation of the European Community patent , would not be beneficial .
Applying the existing Munich arrangements for the European patent to the Community patent is unacceptable , since the Munich system only uses three languages and this would conflict with the principle that all the official languages are equal and create unacceptable discrimination from the procedural point of view as well as problems of legal security .
The European Patent Convention allows , in principle , EU citizens to submit the initial application in their own language and compensation is provided for those applicants who must translate their applications into one of the working languages of the European Patent Office .
I would have to be crazy if I wanted to penalise those countries and say that they have to adopt the European system now .
We opted for producer responsibility rather than individual responsibility in respect of recycling cars .
The loosely @-@ framed common position must be tightened up to discourage free @-@ riders who do not take responsibility for their own waste .
The European Parliament is also responding to the Council and Commission &apos;s desire to respect the rules laid down by the 1993 regulation on the assessment and control of existing substances , on the existence of substitutes and on the difficult balance that needed to be found between the obvious advantages in terms of safety in the event of fire , on the one hand , and the harmful effects of these products on the environment and health , on the other .
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Chechnya .
Our group believes that a Chechen life is of equal value to the life of a citizen of the United States or a citizen of the European Union ...
At that time there was no terrorism but , from 1994 , Russia has done everything it can to prevent such independence .
It is an ongoing war that has been almost unnoticed .
In hoping for the return of 200 000 refugees , Parliament is , of course , doing no more than just expressing a nice idea .
I would also like to thank the Commission for presenting an effective communication containing innovative proposals , which Parliament wishes to strengthen and promote through the Esteve report .
The bombings and killings must stop . The settlements must be dismantled .
So what is the way ahead ?
We also want China to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria . There is no reason why these criteria should be confined to applying only within the borders of Europe .
Firstly , concerning the time in which Member States must report back to the Commission on their experience in implementing the recommendation - the Council can accept our suggested 45 months .
( Applause from the right )
It should not end up being the case that some producers bear an unfair share of the financial burden that this directive implies .
But it is easy to see that the arms industry as a whole is pushing the policy .
However , the second state has not been established , firstly because of the aggression of Arab states towards Israel and secondly , because these same states want the Palestinian people to continue to be disillusioned and resentful .

Let me close with something that is very close to my heart . Tibetans , both those in exile and those in Tibet , who have for 50 years used peaceful means to press for their rights , never resorting to terrorist actions of any kind , should not , in times like our own in which globalised terrorism predominates , be branded as terrorists , but are owed a tribute of respect for their peaceful approach .
This is unacceptable .
Parliament has , as it is , such a modest role in the open method of co @-@ ordination that we must urgently find ways in this Presidency of improving our response time as Parliament .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is a big day for Mr Fatuzzo , as the pensioners &apos; ambassador par excellence .
Mr President , if you would allow me , as the oldest woman in this House , to say something further , it will be to those who have today resisted the idea that we , in view of our longer life expectancy should , of course , be able voluntarily to work for longer .
Amongst the proposals are new limits , a new organisation to oversee risk prevention and a greater effort by all parties involved , specifically by employers , who are asked to provide more training , and who are asked not to shirk their responsibilities by hiring workers without proper contracts , or who are subcontracted .
This must be measured , and certain substances should not be excluded for no apparent reason .
The debate is closed .
Let me say , however , that you are talking of the right of veto and I am talking of unanimous decision @-@ making .
I also think the time is just right .
These families are now being prevented from taking what in a lot of cases would be unwanted children in Romania and other countries - in America in particular .
If we make a comparison of Europe and the US in the areas of business generation and equity financing , particularly amongst small businesses , then venture capital activity demonstrates a huge gap in Europe &apos;s readiness to compete .
In order to allow society to benefit from these innovations , it is important that investments be made .
Thirdly , entrepreneurship must be encouraged .
Ethyl alcohol and synthetic alcohol are , in my view , an excellent example of why we must swiftly address questions about the Treaty , as after 2006 , with the reform of agricultural policy , Parliament will have to take some very fundamental decisions .
The Commission is well aware of the functioning of the German alcohol monopoly .
From the report , it is clear that less progress has been made in these areas than in the area of the Internet .
This CD @-@ ROM was sent to authorities such as Europol over a year ago and no progress at all has yet been made on the matter .
Our responsibility has to be to see them fully respected and put into practice , because education is not only an individual right ; it is also an essential means of promoting peace - a crucial issue today - and ensuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in general .
I can tell her that we are in the process of developing ALFA Plus for the countries of Central and South America .
We look to our societies and to our governments to act internationally to create a sustainable future so that we can change the situation of poverty in which many people live .
I would like to have had more time to examine this aspect of the proposal and , if necessary , to have had time to strengthen these measures even further .
In contrast , the Commission &apos;s proposal for an organisation of the market without intervention measures would be a step in the right direction .
I have voted against Mr Fatuzzo &apos;s report on safe and sustainable pensions .
I suspect that , following the vote on the lifting of the immunity of two opposition politicians - something I regard as irregular - the ruling parties see themselves as victors and do not grasp what three months of mass demonstrations mean , namely that they have forfeited the confidence placed in them and that they themselves are no longer in a position to lead their country out of the crisis at the present point in time .
The conclusions of the troika &apos;s mission and the renewal of the Union &apos;s common position will be examined by the Commission and the Member States over the next few weeks .
Vietnam also needs to extend its legal reforms and ensure that the constitutional rights of all its citizens are applied fully and fairly .
Unfortunately , until now the majority of human rights have not been respected in Guatemala .
The British Government must amend its approach to asylum .
It is a message which policy @-@ makers must take to heart .
The declaration by the Angolan Government giving Unita a bone fide role on the political stage and time to reorganise is , in our view , a step in the right direction .
I therefore believe that the fact that we have been able to hold it is a success in itself .
At this moment - and this is why Mr Solana is not here today - both Mr Solana and Mr Moratinos are visiting the region - and I did not go precisely so that I could be here - and they intend to visit President Arafat and if possible the other leaders in the region .
Some may think that Israel has found a strange way to express that support in recent weeks . But I hope that Mr Peres speaks for the Israeli Government , and that we will see his expressed view reflected in Israel &apos;s attitude towards the aspiration to create a Palestinian State , and Israel &apos;s actions in the Palestinian territories .
And then , if we create a foundation that works , this could be very useful , but now the objectives should focus not on creating new foundations but on achieving a peace conference with European participation , with everybody &apos;s participation , which may work .
A doctor told us that to stop an injured man bleeding , whose throat had been pierced by a bullet , the only thing they had to hand was wire .
Israel &apos;s third enemy is certainly the refusal hitherto of many countries to recognise its existence or to maintain appropriate relations with the country .
With regard to the Middle East , we are struck by one thing - from a European perspective at least - which is that Europe and its Member States , bound together as they are by a false sense of European solidarity , are once again absent from the Middle East stage where the tragic events we are witnessing have been going on not just for weeks and months but for years .
We must condemn its action and we must demand that the guilty be held responsible , with Israel itself holding the soldiers who have committed these inhuman acts to account .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner Patten has once again , and impressively , set out a convincing position by the European Union on the conflict in the Middle East , and I want to make some comments on it .
It was a model statement which was at once calm and rational and strong and balanced , outlining the situation as it exists and the steps that are necessary on all sides to create a sustainable peace in the region .
Those who tabled the resolution chose to criticise the State of Israel on twelve occasions , but the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority on only three occasions .
I take great satisfaction from this , and we shall also pursue this policy because I believe it is absolutely crucial .
If we were to adopt this approach , we could perhaps also obtain some experience of use in connection with the developing countries .
Mr President , many of you this week will have noticed the exhibition about the work of Herman Hesse in the Spinelli building .
Segregation and genuine State terrorism govern and shape the lives of women , if they do not decree their death through savage practices such as stoning .
The Commission is actively endeavouring to implement its new strategy , which comprises a longer @-@ term concept providing for the selection of a limited number of subject areas , which it treats as of core importance and in which the Community &apos;s contribution can bring about real change .
We will pay precise attention to how amenable to discussions the Council is , and to how openly it deals with us .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
There is every reason to welcome the Commission &apos;s programme of action for the mainstreaming of gender equality in Community development cooperation .
The President of the Commission and my fellow @-@ Commissioner Verheugen have made this clear on their respective travels in the candidate countries , in discussions with which this point is one that I always raise myself .
Now , there is greater interest in such a strategy &apos;s being applied , and it is incredibly valuable for money to be earmarked for information activities at local level .
All workers in the Community are now ensured a minimum level of protection , which the individual Member States are able to go beyond .
We need a more straightforward and more transparent fleet policy , and we also need it to work .
We are faced with multiple applications and the associated misuse of social security benefits as well .
Madam President , take a look at the Council &apos;s benches : there is nobody there ; take a look at the Commission &apos;s benches : I am delighted to share this sitting with Mr Fischler , but I believe that agriculture and fisheries are not exactly what we are talking about .
Moreover , such a short time period gives the highly indebted countries little time to develop multisectoral strategies for combating poverty and forces local governments to spend money and funds on reaching the completion point rather than on implementing a sustainable programme and a credible plan for combating poverty .
These are statistics that must make us pause for thought .
We are also very pleased that the amendment widening the definition of the family went through .
This also applies to the overview of the human rights situation for each country via an EU agency .
I will take up this matter while at the same time bearing in mind the need to recognise the separation of powers between the political and judicial authorities .
And I will certainly make this point at the Convention on the future of Europe , of which I am a member .
In our opinion , this sufficiently guarantees both the objectives of Parliament and the Commission in the field of transparency and compliance with Regulation ( EC ) No 1049 / 2001 in relation to which - as I pointed out before - we are already taking steps which go beyond what is required .
Now that the text has been analysed in more detail , the Commission understands that the Committee on Transport is proposing 33 amendments to the common position .
The 14 @-@ day period represents a compromise between the seven days initially proposed by the Commission and the 30 days for which Parliament lobbied .
In particular , the common position includes : fully harmonised and detailed general information requirements ; the principle of written confirmation ; a right of withdrawal with some exceptions ; protection for the user on the chosen means of payment and redress in the event of disputes .
It is a revision of a directive , which , in this case , means that two very important changes have been made , the substance of which we are satisfied with in any case .
We will propose them to establish a broader framework and then see how it might be done .
Tourism is important for growth .
However , the Council decision was amended to extend the life of Tempus II for a further two years .
I would like at this point to thank Commissioner Reding for her initiative in the past , but above all for her commitment and for the way she got to grips with the task of listening to young people and involving them directly .
It is only in the European Union that it is not meant to have a part to play .
The objections my group has in this connection pertain to the idea that such competitions should be organised and funded by the Commission .
The European Year will take place throughout the Union , and I think that the eyes of the whole Union will be on this event and it will be a wonderful opportunity to promote the social , educational and cultural values of sport , whilst reminding us of the roots of the Games when sport was not simply a business , but was a festival of culture and education .
Such transparency is , by the way , not only in the interests of European democracy , but also in the interests of the European Central Bank , which is thereby - and as recent years have clearly demonstrated - made more credible , more legitimate and more trustworthy .
The liberal group is also acutely aware of the ethical dilemmas posed by the ever faster evolving technological possibilities .
Mr President , this is a great piece of work , and I would like to thank Mr Caudron most warmly , as well as Mr Busquin , who has left his mark on this programme with new ideas .
Parliament has played a very important role in this process , through the Caudron report at the first reading of the Framework Programme .
Thank you very much !
We would like the Council to come forward with the right kind of conclusions so it can be included in the 2003 procedure .
Indeed , we know that European citizens cannot attend these events : irrespective of whether they interest thousands or dozens of people , the fact is that the public cannot have access to them without an invitation .
Besides the tax aspects which we do not think are covered sufficiently in the report , this is another reason why we feel that Amendment No 8 is an absolute minimum in terms of corporate income tax and the implementation of the conclusions of the Primarolo report .
Producing homogenised statistics for the whole of the Union could prove to be a useful exercise , and that is why we voted in favour of the report .
When are we going to concern ourselves , then , Mr President , with the bad debt of States as regards pensions ?
When the topic of tourism is raised in the EP , this invariably revolves around the issue of transferring the income from the people living in northern Member States to the Mediterranean beaches .
I suggest we call it the Fatuzzo University .
Turning more directly to Justice and Home Affairs issues , we are going to prioritise measures such as the carrying out of a study to improve the control of sea borders , prevention , and the adoption of operative measures , in particular the exchange of information , which is already yielding very good results , and we are going to strongly urge States of origin and transit States to combat human trafficking and readmit illegal immigrants who leave their territory , amongst other things .
As Mr Patten has said , we have on the table a legislative working programme - but not only that - presented by the Commission following the Tampere conclusions .
Mr President , what is progress , and what are the perspectives in the Council &apos;s report that we are talking about ?
We have initiated a series of dialogues with countries of origin and transit ; including Asian countries .
In principle , the idea may be included within the framework of our scientific and technological cooperation , but we will need to know more details about the nature of the Russian proposals .
Flexible arrangements for the transport of people and goods may well be important preconditions for Kaliningrad &apos;s growth process , and they also have symbolic value in the eyes of people in the no @-@ man &apos;s @-@ land between containment and exclusion , but , despite what many in Moscow continue to believe , they are not enough to bring about growth on their own .
Business as usual .
This is not , of course , the type of language we use , Mr President .
And this must be done regardless of the debates that are taking place between those responsible for the pension systems in the various countries , within the Open Method of Coordination that was initiated in Lisbon .
I am not happy about this situation , but that is how it is .
And that , should we deviate from this , we will have a careful exchange of views beforehand .
Unfortunately , I am not in a position to tell you what the actual implementation rate was .
However , I do not believe that this debate will delay the adoption of a framework programme for research , which is much wider .
As you know , this is a scenario which is currently being discussed .
Jobs must be developed to incorporate more creativity , to provide a better response to social requirements and to promote human dignity .
There is a common thread running through all the proposals for regulations , and that is the emphasis on the primary responsibility of food producers for the safety of the foodstuffs they place on the market .
However , overly strict hygiene measures must not be perceived as barriers to trade .
In the UK alone it is going to effect 300 000 businesses , costing an estimated GBP 2 billion a year for SMEs alone .
It took our country 25 @-@ 30 years to put in place a system that worked .
The Commission therefore favoured a progressive approach to reducing salmonella occurrence .
Noise is an important environmental problem which we know concerns millions of EU citizens .
In addition , the Commission is currently working on all initiatives aimed at increasing public administration capacity in social policies , through exchanges of experience , best practice and know @-@ how .
These bilateral cooperation arrangements are the precursor of the successful application of the common European strategy .
We also need to understand that NATO and the EU need to work closer together , by bringing together the non @-@ military tools at the EU &apos;s disposal , combined with the decisive military capabilities available to NATO .
The United States welcomed the way concerted action is developing in the area , as this represents tangible evidence of President Putin &apos;s Western leanings . In addition , the United States declared its commitment to reach an agreement with Russia on the reduction of nuclear weapons prior to the next summit .
The third possibility is for us to choose a quite different role , namely that of being the civilian and global power that can intervene before crises arise and before weapons become necessary .
But we Europeans must admit that security does not come cheap and that perhaps we need to spend even more in order to achieve it .
It was deemed incompatible as it would be against the spirit of Amendment No 40 , if it was carried , to then vote on Amendments Nos 1 and 2 on paragraphs 16 and 17 .
Community resources must benefit all countries .
The fact that , after the fall of the Soviet Union , Russia foundered , that its economy collapsed due to plundering by the nouveaux riches and the corrupt authorities , and that its people were plunged into poverty are problems that more often than not fail to cause European leaders any great concern .
We must take account of the fact that no democratic society can endure weekly terrorist actions without demanding that its leaders act .
That is why the EU is now being accused of helping to finance terrorism . That is the explanation for going in and destroying villages and all the Palestinian structures .
I believe that we should now do everything possible to prevent conduct which could stop us from making a rapid , and parallel , start on work in three directions : security , the new composition of the Palestinian Authority and the new legitimisation of the Palestinian Authority and of the peace process .
These basic documents remind us of the need for more structured planning of the Union &apos;s initiatives at the level of the Presidency , and confirm the need for better horizontal coordination of the various formations of the Council .
Mr President , I would also like to start by thanking Mr Javier Solana , the Secretary @-@ General of the Council , for attending this debate and by congratulating him on the document he presented in March and which was the subject of a preliminary debate in Barcelona .
All the documents - - including those from Council working groups - - that are subject to the co @-@ decision procedure and the first pillar , must be available .
The Northern Irish issue springs to mind .
Yet the draft decision enables the EU institutions to discriminate in their recruitment on the grounds of age .
We do not want to go into the issue of competence between satellite systems and nor do intelligence matters fall within the competence of the European Union .
Firstly , borders are not guarded by soldiers . Within the EU , borders are controlled by border police .
It is the culmination of fifteen months of work .
( The President cut off the speaker )
We cannot , though , create clarity in a conflict situation via the political level .
That does not change the fact that the Member States themselves grew up and were defined merely in response to a need for integration in times past . They are structures dating from before the present age of globalisation .
The Court of Justice already acts as constitutional court , including the famous subsidiarity appeal , and I am slightly concerned about this appeal that appears to be on the horizon .
The risk of the rigidity of watertight classifications , subject by subject , which several Members have already mentioned , could perhaps freeze the division of competences more than is required for the sake of clarity .
Fourthly , a solution to the conflict between Iraq and the international community by non @-@ military means in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council .
We can only acknowledge the weak results achieved by UN sanctions over the past eleven years .
The internal conflicts within the ruling Socialist Party - very present since last autumn in the Albanian political arena - ultimately led to the fall of the Meta government in February .
I also note that the honourable Member &apos;s proposal gives no guarantee against any adverse effect it could have on trade between Member States .
We hope the following objectives will be achieved at the Johannesburg Summit . First of all , it should mark the coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol .
There are , however , extremely few experts engaged in the solution of cross @-@ border problems .
The Barcelona Summit , in which the EU &apos;s position was to be firmly set out , was also a disappointment .
A clear agenda for sustainable development was set as long as ten years ago in Rio but , since then , developments have , however , largely been in the opposite direction .
Some speakers have mentioned the lack of clear decisions concerning participation from the highest levels of government .
Five years after the first summit , it is clear that the progress made - a fall of 40 million in the 800 million who are suffering from hunger - is very small compared with the objective of halving the number of undernourished people by 2015 .
It is my great pleasure , on behalf of our President and the entire House , to welcome members of a delegation from the Uzbek Parliament , who are seated in the official gallery , to the third meeting of the EU @-@ Republic of Uzbekistan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee , which has just been held in Strasbourg .
If it envisages having , for example , a policy of &apos; lifelong learning &apos; , it is to provide employers with a mobile workforce that has the right qualifications to meet their needs .
Even in the case of competences shared between the EU and the Member States , the definition places the EU as the one that &apos; lays down the rules &apos; , &apos; coordinates &apos; or &apos; intervenes in a complementary or a supplementary fashion &apos; .
That would not be possible without establishing a stable financial framework for relations between the European Union and the United Nations .
It has to be flexible to meet all kinds of circumstances , but basically this more problematic way of planning things is also what we are discussing with the UN family .
We do not want to engage in core funding because we are not a nation .
Who gave those orders ?
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
I think that if there is a problem , Mr Marset Campos , it is not globalisation but the lack of globalisation .
Mr President , I am grateful for the answer of the Commissioner .
If there are other questions to be asked about personnel management or any other aspect of this controversy , then I would leave that to your good offices in the Conference of Presidents .
We shall have them scientifically assessed and shall draw up multiannual stock recovery and stock management plans as and where necessary .
I welcome the 6 and 12 mile limit retention , but beyond 12 miles I have some very serious concerns about the wording of the documents in relation to access to waters and resources and in relation to relative stability .
It concerns a neoliberal reform to scrap boats , which clears the way for a CFP that is neither Community @-@ minded , as it turns its back on European solidarity and increases the North @-@ South divide , nor is it political , as the Commission refuses to exercise its powers , and nor does it have the interests of fisheries at heart as it condemns the sector it is meant to protect , and in particular coastal fishermen , to extinction .
We must acknowledge this , and this means that measures must be taken .
We all know that .
Secondly , I can say with a certain degree of pride that the proposals have not substantially changed or been changed .
What sounds perfectly plausible and reasonable to start with may harbour a huge risk ; because it is a closed circle , the big fish will be able to eat up the little fish .
The fact of the matter is that we have never been able to bring about greater competition in any area , and I include the airlines , without some rich people and some people varied in their approach coming into a market which is being opened up .
The Commission believes that we must shoulder this responsibility as of now .
The Commission shares the view of our Central American partner that it is necessary to keep alive the particular nature of the San José dialogue .
We ought not and must not rest on our laurels .
Mr President , the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office is pleased with the debate generated . In addition , the Presidency is grateful for Parliament &apos;s unfailing encouragement and would like to acknowledge publicly the support and inspiration this House has always offered .
Parliament already ruled on the appropriateness of including the Europol budget in the Community budget when called to do so in the past .
Whilst democratic influence and control have been left out in the cold , though , Europol &apos;s competences have been extended , step by step , since 1998 .
We think that as part of this measure and in the interim review we should strengthen the eco @-@ conditionality of aid and establish a link between the disbursement of direct payments and the provision of services within a multifunctional system , extending eco @-@ conditionality measures in favour of sustainable development .
We must allocate the resources to achieve this ambition by gradually re @-@ allocating a significant part of the Community budget of the &apos; market &apos; pillar to the &apos; rural development &apos; pillar , whilst encouraging all types of agricultural businesses , and particularly the most fragile .
The Fiori report contains a great many specific ideas , but because of the divergence of interests in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , and I assume in this House in general , they are not always totally consistent .
But our main concern is the attempt by the Council and the big groups to confer broad powers to require telecommunications companies and Internet service providers to keep data which map people &apos;s daily lives and contacts , that is traffic , billing , location data and so on for possible access by law enforcement agencies .
Unlike paper @-@ based advertising , this is often at the expense of the recipient .
We really must , I think , keep exceptions to a minimum , so as to ensure that any interested party can access a broad range of information .
Practice has shown that the pursuit of the sustainable production of drinking water is hindered by the lack of sustainability in the use of plant protection products .
I think that these thematic strategies are a measure that should be extended to many areas .
Mr President , despite the support given by the European Parliament last November and the Commission &apos;s expectations for a successful outcome of the discussions in the Council , no decision on the temporary defence mechanism , TDM , was taken at the meeting of industry ministers in December last year .
My reply to these two questions is negative .
We have very vulnerable points along the entire energy supply chain .
In its White Paper , the Commission states that we should promote the railways , that we should start re @-@ using abandoned infrastructure and using lines that are specifically intended for goods transport by rail , and that we should tackle the difficulties at border crossings , as these constitute the pressure points . The Iron Rhine project meets all these conditions , that are listed in the report and in the Commission &apos;s White Paper .
In 1996 , when the Decision that we are seeking to modify today was adopted , this issue was discussed at length .
The irony is that on this particular occasion it is being offered as a solution to an area for which there is no problem in the first place .
Of course , I agree with Mrs ? ratsa that the question of equal opportunities , as regards policy both within the company and outside , is one of the basic points .
The remaining amendments cannot be accepted by the Commission .
In the past , mail and telephone confidentiality was introduced to guarantee people freedom , but the compromise between the two main groups now makes it possible to abolish the protection of personal data .
Nor does it suffice that its material powers have increased to the point at which there is no form of serious crime ( including so @-@ called terrorism ) in which it is not involved .
Mr Fiori is right to mention the environment and food safety , but I have a feeling that , in practice , his main interests revolve around the WTO requirements , maintaining agricultural subsidies for southern Europe following the accession of poorer Eastern European countries , and blocking national regulations as far as possible .
It is of course all too easy to point only to South Korea &apos;s policy of giving subsidies .
I am told we will not have hot water .
I will not be repeating what my fellow MEPs , Mrs van der Laan and Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen , have said .
I remember the vote held on the matter in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
The new rules must not lead to a situation in which , at the conclusion of a debate in a committee , we organise non @-@ existent pseudo @-@ majorities to vote against a report in order to comply with the formal requirements for getting it debated in plenary .
Mr President , every parliament needs a Richard Corbett - a man whose knowledge of and commitment to the Rules of Procedure is beyond compare and , although my expertise is less than his , I fully share with Mr Corbett the belief that good rules make for sound democracy .
There is in fact something dysfunctional here in Parliament , and it is the process of debate which , for far too long , has been far too predictable and therefore quite boring as well .
I should like to draw your attention to various points made in the Corbett report .
Even then , we can go back to the usual procedures if only two groups or 32 Members make such a request .
We in the PPE @-@ DE Group concur with Mr Duff &apos;s approach and the analysis contained in the report &apos;s explanatory statement .
Indeed , we looked for , and failed to find , the insight that it is due to the unequal distribution of paid and unpaid labour between men and women that women are over @-@ represented among the poor .
I would like to assure her - though hopefully she needs no such assurance - that such passion and such conviction is shared also on this side of the House , as I am sure it is right across the House .
Not only is the inclusion of these elements uncalled for in Phase I , but some will also reduce the much @-@ needed flexibility required in the system .
I am also a former director of the second largest airline in Britain .
Such a tough reality has allowed us to move ahead on other initiatives which will improve maritime safety and benefit maritime traffic and therefore the maritime sector as a whole .
In this regard , I would like to insist once again that in our resolution on the Valencia Conference , we express our unanimous concern at the human rights situation , we defend the need for the situation not to worsen in certain countries with which we have signed association agreements - and the conditions are worsening - and we propose the establishment of mechanisms for applying the democratic clause .
In reality , Europe says a lot but does very little , simply because , deep down , it attaches little importance to its relationship with the Maghreb .
It simply means that animals will be tested upon in countries outside the European Union where no proper supervision can be undertaken .
In this context the Council common position on effecting a marketing ban on animal @-@ tested cosmetics , subject to permission by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , is untenable .
Mr President , on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy for this report and congratulate them on the impressive work they have done .
Of course we must encourage unremunerated donation .
This would not prohibit the payment of travel expenses and compensation for lost working time , which is important for donors of plasma in particular , who often have to travel to another area and give up a lot of their time .
The debate is closed .
Thus it would remove , firstly , the possibility of not strictly respecting the descending order of weight in the list of ingredients and , secondly , the possibility of using the expression &quot; and / or &quot; in the case of ingredients which are interchangeable according to availability .
The Commission proposal to now replace this sales ban with a mere test ban is totally unacceptable and of great concern in view of massive public demand to end the use of animal testing for cosmetics .
I concur with the view of the Green @-@ Conservative coalition of rapporteurs that it would be preferable to make an economic migration superfluous by providing incomes and employment in their own countries , but that need not lead to support for the leaders of a unified Maghreb .
Why , therefore , produce yet another report on a matter that has been discussed numerous times , except to try to re @-@ launch an integration process that seems even more doomed than ever .
They are all the more surprised to learn that these things are laid down on a national rather than European basis .
The mobilisation of alternative funding resources , with the intention of combining alternative resources , such as the so @-@ called Tobin tax , with global public assets and the possible extension of the &apos; Highly @-@ indebted poor countries &apos; initiative .
Madam President , the meeting in Bali was a failure .
Perhaps you could tell us who is opposed to this and how we can make progress in this area .
The United States of America and the other industrialised countries are obviously primarily responsible , but the European Union must build a bridge to the less developed countries too .
I am pleased to inform you all that the European Parliament has genuinely left its mark on this directive , whose purpose it is to prevent any kind of discrimination at work on grounds of sex .
The general clause will be supplemented by specific rules covering the various categories of unfair commercial practices both before and after sale .
Since the Bureau has been in existence for some six or seven years , I wonder why it did not find this out sooner .
Why did rapid alert not work ?
The sugar sector has , moreover , been the subject of specific inquiries in the context of the Regulation on the control of concentrations between undertakings .
However I have to say , at the risk of repeating myself , that the relevant scientific committee has looked at this now on three separate occasions .
I can assure her , however , that there is no sphere in which the Commission will act irresponsibly .
For the mainstream programmes which represent over 90 % of the financial envelope available in the Structural Funds , the Commission has set clear guidelines which explicitly encourage the support of a balanced and sustainable development of tourism , in particular through three activities :
Secondly , given that the Commission proposes to do this before making proposals which then go before the Council and Parliament , how does it envisage following the amendments being made by the Council and Parliament to ensure that there is an impact assessment of those amendments ?
What I would most like to see , however , and I repeat , is for the Olympic affair to be resolved in a positive way , for all the initiatives and the work undertaken by the Greek authorities to privatise Olympic to reach a positive conclusion and simply not to see this type of information about further alleged aid from the Greek Government .
In my view , we can make a lot of headway with this new approach of genetic engineering etc .
In conclusion , the Joint Research Centre &apos;s main objectives will therefore be to remain close to its users - the European Parliament and the Commission - to develop its role as a recognised centre of excellence on issues of safety , health and the environment , and to develop its activities as a promoter of research networks .
It is a closed institution and is regulated solely by the Council .
The main reason for this is that serious problems with specific parts of this amendment arose in Council .
This is a good idea and it enjoys parliamentary support .
In this context , the communication that the Commission presented recently , entitled &quot; Towards integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union &quot; takes on particular importance .
Our discussions now under way on legal immigration and the right of asylum could break down if we do not take on board our fellow citizens &apos; concerns about illegal immigration .
The President of the Commission mentioned it a moment ago : plans are already drawn up for illegal immigration .
It might also be required that a national parliament &apos;s decision to use the veto be made openly .
Bringing modern IT skills within the scope of lifelong learning , which is Commissioner Liikanen &apos;s department , has , for example , already made progress in many countries .
The European citizens are demanding this .
My second point is the issue of immigration .
Mr President , honourable Members , the new version of the financial regulation is one of the largest and most comprehensive pieces of legislation during this parliamentary term , which is why I should like to thank you on the Commission &apos;s behalf for the excellent collaboration which we have enjoyed with the European Parliament and the Council and , most importantly , with the two committees , the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Mr President , this is another case where confusion has arisen because the amendments distributed before the vote do not quite correspond to the amendments contained in the report because there was a linguistic correction in between , but Mr Wuermeling is right .
Member States &apos; exclusion of this small territory from the right to vote reflects no credit on them .
This is a first and important step in making Parliament a more effective voice for the people in EU decision @-@ making .
This is not a case of wishful thinking , but it is an exercise that consists of truly applying the principles which all the institutions are attached to : the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament .
It is there in black and white .
We cannot make additional demands .
We are constrained to live within Berlin &apos;s limits , but if a deal is postponed until autumn - as some propose - this would jeopardise the prospect of admitting new Member States in time for the European Parliament elections in 2004 .
We must establish whether this provision conforms with European law . The same applies to what is known as the 1946 Criminal Indemnity Act .
Mr President , Poland has made great progress in its journey back to Europe , at the cost of great sacrifice and the risk of unpopularity on the part of its governments , which have determinedly pursued this objective .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the forthcoming enlargement which is the subject of our debate today naturally poses a unique challenge to the European Union .
The Commission is not happy either since the Sapard funds have not been used in the way we wanted .
On these matters , Madam President , countries must either put up or shut up .
The Commission will have to try to answer this question during the current debate on the common fisheries policy .
I would hate anyone to misunderstand or misinterpret the decision of the Irish electorate not to approve the Treaty of Nice , because the Irish population in general , even those who oppose the adoption of the Treaty of Nice , is in favour of enlargement .
Fear that enlargement will be too fast after all , or that it will be too costly after all , or both .
We should also point out that , where reforms are being introduced , suitable institutional and administrative mechanisms and the funds are lacking or the laws passed are not applied .
I think this is cause for concern , not because of either the Commission &apos;s or the Spanish Presidency &apos;s handling of the matter but because we are in the grotesque situation in which the Fifteen have still not been able to reach agreement on a common position regarding the issue of direct aid to agriculture , and the divisions between the EU countries are particularly striking in this area .
That is particularly so at the interfaces of enlargement , that is the border regions .
Member States should monitor European money as well as their own money , starting with my own government .
The Commission and the applicant countries must prepare for enlargement in a way that avoids needless delays in the start @-@ up of programmes and so that the money set aside for these preparations can be used effectively .
It must be stated , of course , that the purpose of the Community authorisation is not to create the AIEM , because the Spanish authorities are free to do this , as long as Community directives on VAT and on special consumer taxes do not apply in the Canaries .
But those derogations from the rules of the single market were intended to be temporary and to be phased out .
It has definitely helped the fight against fraud and in doing so has improved the workings of the internal market .
Other points , ladies and gentlemen , that were approved in the text and accepted by the Council and Commission as a consequence of this Parliament &apos;s amendments at first reading .
ICES estimates that cod stocks in the North Sea are at their lowest level since 1963 and that technical measures and TAC reductions alone will not be enough to restore them to within safe limits .
A repeat of this debacle and the lack of proportion must be avoided .
Madam President , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a very courageous report .
In the meantime we have to work with the best advice we have , which is the ICES advice .
Portuguese law already contained such provisions , but this will now become a Community measure .
If you ask me for my personal opinion - and this is also what Mrs Petersen said -I would have been satisfied with sound self @-@ regulatory measures , and legislation would not have been by definition necessary .
This is why voluntary agreements with industry have to be treated with great care .
May I congratulate not only the rapporteur , but also my own colleague , Hermann Vermeer , for his excellent work in leading the search for a compromise and breaking the early deadlock between the two sides of the House , one insisting that voluntary agreements should never have a role , and the other saying that legislation should never have a role .
Clearly , as Mrs Vlasto said , small enterprises are one of the keys to success in the European economies .
In order to make websites accessible to the equipment of people with disabilities , these websites need to be of a correct technical design .
Although we have doubts about the charitably generous view that the guidelines will be fully implemented by the end of 2003 , we feel we must insist on this aim and make particular demands with regard to those public Web sites which , having a specific social function or being of particular importance for the disabled and the elderly , must be the first to fully meet this objective .
Mr President , I want to point out again that there is an error in the French translation of Amendment No 4 in which the phrase , &quot; both safe and acceptable &quot; has been translated as &quot; both healthy and acceptable . &quot;
Even before enlargement , there is a need for Europe @-@ wide safety standards to be created for nuclear power stations , so that we can provide the citizens of an enlarged EU with a high degree of safety in this area .
I am delighted that Parliament has overwhelmingly approved paragraph 49 regretting the passing by the US Senate of a bill which would allow for the use of force by the US to prevent its citizens from being tried by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
I am delighted that amendments underlining the absolute priority of the political criteria have been adopted along the lines of my own amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs to its opinion .
This approach goes some way towards safeguarding the Commission &apos;s line , which has the merit of speeding up a process which might otherwise drag on indefinitely and only achieve its objective after an extremely lengthy consultation process .
Now of all times , when the World Cup is on in Japan and South Korea , it should not be forgotten that many footballs are made by children .
B5 @-@ 0375 / 2002 , by Mrs Morgantini and Mrs Frahm , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on Malaysia ;
I would appeal to the Commission and to Commissioner Liikanen , whom I would call upon to approach Commissioner Patten , to step up all their contacts with Belarus .
This has been rubberstamped by more than 36 European countries .
It is irrelevant whether foot and mouth disease has broken out or is present in South Korea or in another country of the world .
Thank you , Commissioner Liikanen .
We categorically condemn the attacks on the Palestinian Authority and defend the fundamental right of the Palestinian people to select their own leaders .
That is also the thinking behind some of the amendments that have been tabled .
The rapporteur has , among other things , taken on board two important amendments .
Before examining the merits of the proposal , I would like to make two initial comments .
Madam President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur , and I think that this report really enables us to make progress on an issue of great significance politically , economically , and in terms of environmental and energy policy .
My experience in this House since 1994 tells me that , on fiscal issues , the Member States persist in adopting a self @-@ centred approach , and that any agreement on uniformity in the taxation of energy is still a long way off .
As has often been mentioned , the cultivation of renewable raw materials could be an additional - and welcome - source of income for agriculture in the European Union .
If the Rules of Procedure were reformed and people knew what we are doing here - and above all what we are failing to do here - then this place would be full to overflowing .
I have listed only three points .
I therefore call upon the Commission to consult the budgetary authority again prior to the reallocation of funds within transport TENs . Amendment No 8 lays down the terms for the implementation of the proposal as regards the trans @-@ European transport network , as established by Decision 1692 / 96 adopted on 23 July 1996 .
Naturally , we shall still be highlighting these issues .
In it , you make the critical observation that , if another letter of amendment on agriculture is to be submitted in the autumn , then that might perhaps be brought forward .
I am slowly getting sick of the way we have the same procedure every year for promoting town @-@ twinning .
Is this because of the matters Mrs Buitenweg raised about Member States not wanting to use these funds ?
This Summit will be an opportunity to fulfil our objectives of fighting poverty and environmental degradation and to promote the development of the less advanced countries .
As I said , however , there are other processes under way , both within the EU and on its doorstep , as Mr Aznar said in his speech , and these demand that we review the workings of the institutions as of now - resolutely , swiftly and pragmatically - without waiting for the Treaties to be amended and without interfering in the work of the Convention .
A rationalisation of the number of Councils is no doubt called for , but it would be far better for this to be done in conjunction - as the President of the Commission said - with similar moves in Parliament and in the Commission so that lines of accountability and responsibility are clear .
I should like to call upon our fellow MEPs from France and Luxembourg to give their ministers a lesson in openness and parliamentary democracy .
This practice , Mr Aznar , has made it very difficult for you to sound sincere .
We look with some interest at what may happen in Ireland in the referendum , which may turn upon the charms of our President .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , today this European immigration policy that we need for the twenty @-@ first century does not exist , but there are proposals for it .
And neither do I believe that anything is to be gained from holding sterile debates on whether Europe should be a fortress or not .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
In order to have a genuine discussion on the choice between the various forms of energy , we should subject these corporations to checks on their strategy and even their approach to their research .
The average annual inflation rate in 2001 , as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices , was 2.5 % .
The results of voting in the Governing Council should also be made public .
The debt incurred by companies and private individuals is the cause of particular concern .
Mr President , that was not the position taken by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and it is unfortunate that Mr Trakatellis has not kept to the usual practice of presenting the Committee &apos; on the Environment &apos;s report , but has , regrettably , reproduced his own position .
A threshold value of 0.5 % simply cannot be complied with at present .
In the debate about genetically modified organisms , we cannot confine ourselves to technical discussions ; the ethical aspects need to be brought to the fore .
I would remind you of the debate surrounding the non @-@ food regulation dating back some five years .
It would be wrong to give in to attempts to demonise GM foods and feedstuffs .
The vote tomorrow will determine the future of genetically modified food in Europe .
( The sitting was suspended at 5.58 p.m. and resumed at 6.00 p.m. )
I also welcome the fact that we have a press release from the Commission on this .
The protectionist measures taken by the US have caused a significant price increase in the American market .
Adults are twice as likely as previously thought to develop cancer after being exposed to tritium and this particular tritium was discharged by a factory .
As far as I can see , the registration problem still stands because it is now in the fleet but it was irregular to begin with .
More importantly , it must be in keeping with WTO rules and not hamper the development of biotechnology in Europe with excessive red tape .
Labelling serves the purpose of informing consumers and users and allowing them to exercise choice .
Some claim that the amounts involved at EU level , compared to national health expenditures , are so tiny that it is arguable whether we can achieve anything meaningful at EU level .
A pro @-@ active policy must be adopted in order to remove such enterprises from these estates , if possible with the help of European funds .
Member States have the possibility to make use of Article 176 of the EC Treaty to introduce lower threshold levels at national level as the Netherlands has done .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights requires us to uphold human dignity and protect life .
A desire to safeguard basic rights should be reason enough for voting in favour of the report .
Personally I do not have any difficulties with the morning @-@ after pill .
We shall still find that there is something missing from the framework .
However , the local health promotion and disease prevention strategy is the responsibility of the Member States .
Liability looked as though it would be a big problem but , fortunately , it was overcome .
The EU is a political project which therefore applies to both men and women .
As you can see , there are many strong social and economic reasons for focusing more on local labour markets .
On the question of youth employment - there are hundred of thousands of young people right across Europe who are excluded from the labour market for all kinds of reasons .
Our committee also considers that WTO member countries have a particular responsibility to observe core labour standards and calls on the WTO to clearly state that sanctions imposed by the ILO will not be considered incompatible with the WTO treaties .
Lastly , the report emphasises the essential and positive role of trade unions working to promote core labour standards within the context of the World Trade Organisation , and also stresses the importance of the role of non @-@ governmental organisations .
Also it is important that the core labour standards - these ILO standards - are given the dedication and focus needed for their implementation , as indeed the rapporteur so eloquently pointed out .
Mr President , I regret the fact that this House , when considering the report on the promotion of the use of biofuels , did not advocate making the addition of biodiesel mandatory .
These two statements - the first , unilateral in nature , made by Ireland , and the second made by the Council which takes account of the former ( or takes note of it , depending on the language version ) - seem to guarantee each country &apos;s freedom of choice in terms of security and defence policy in general , and in terms of each process in particular .
When we adopted our original timeshare legislation I hoped that the long queue of people coming to see me about problems would come to an end .
. ( PT ) This report deserves my vote , because it is major step forwards in raising awareness of the complex interconnection between globalisation and the promotion of core labour standards .
This is something we must avoid .
Angola has enormous resources , huge talents and huge hopes .
In my view , we ought to start telling these neighbouring countries that it is no longer acceptable to support Mr Mugabe &apos;s policies , or that they , on the one hand , pay lip service to such things as good governance , and yet continue to display their loyalty to Mr Mugabe .
B5 @-@ 0412 / 2002 , by Mr Hernández Mollar , on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group , on homosexuals in Egypt ;
When this document is ratified , we will probably have to maintain some influence over the handling of the case in question .
Despite everything , it is a European state . It is a neighbour of Latvia , Lithuania and Poland , of the enlarged EU .
The dollar / peso parity , provided for through a change in the constitution , made exports far too expensive and therefore killed off the exports sector .
In a common position , we have all - the Member States and Parliament - given our word .
That is how repugnant it is .
The problem with the recycling target is that it can never absolutely suit all countries .
For example , fibre packaging is easily manufactured from recyclable , renewable raw materials .
I feel a special responsibility to ensure that we do not forget that and ensure that this directive continues to develop in a positive way for the environment .
As we have said so many times already , we will vote for this draft , but one most specific area seems to me to be in real need of improvement .
I am pleased to say that over the past years around EUR 640 million were allocated by the Union for trade @-@ related assistance , of which about 61 % went to the ACP Group , 14 % to Latin America and 12 % to the Mediterranean .
How is this possible , and why does this not work elsewhere ?
It is a very exciting train of thought Mr Deva has embarked upon when it comes to enterprises , which we cannot manage without .
Because the use of animal meal for ruminants had already been forbidden for a number of years , the ban mainly concerned the pig and poultry sectors .
Cows became cannibals and the animals &apos; nature was no longer taken into consideration .
Mr President , honourable Members , I will just take this opportunity to add a couple of comments on the issues that have emerged as the core of the debate .
Our report and the Commission &apos;s regulation follow two lines : we call for very close cooperation between civil and military air navigation service providers and we consider that military authorities should be represented on the Single Sky Committee .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to preface what I have to say with a few words of gratitude addressed to both rapporteurs , Mr Fava and Mrs Sanders @-@ ten Holte , taking as I do the view that both reports have been drafted with great care and have also demonstrated a very responsible approach to their subject @-@ matter .
I come from an island nation with a high dependence on air transport and improved efficiency in these transport models is extremely important to enable future economic development to take place in my country .
Here , it is abundantly clear , the question arises of whether air traffic management &apos;s highly @-@ sensitive safety issues might not be better taken care of by a public service , which would incorporate the advantages of the integration of the individual services into one single chain with the required quality of work , professional qualifications and the necessary material resources .
Every day millions of litres of fuel are wasted and unnecessary emissions are produced because of aviation delays and aircraft in transit across Europe &apos;s skies .
It is also vulnerable .
I would say to the honourable Members that they should look carefully at this , that there are only cross @-@ border blocks insofar as there is an agreement between the two States of the Union .
A good balance has been struck , in our view .
Its far @-@ reaching consequences and the many interests involved have meant that this proposal has spawned quite a reaction , to which the Commissioner referred earlier .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission &apos;s proposal for a regulation shows that the obsession to make everything uniform with no regard for subsidiarity will affect those on the lowest incomes .
That concludes the vote .
The emphasis on generating energy by incineration is wrong , for this only allows the producers and processors of polluting packaging to carry on as before .
I am talking about single @-@ hulled oil tankers , ramshackle lorries and poorly @-@ maintained noisy aircraft .
When the time comes , I shall propose that natural , technological and environmental risk prevention should become a high , almost inevitable priority of future regional policy programmes after 2006 .
Compensation would mainly have to come from the Member State &apos;s national share and insurance companies .
My group is therefore unambiguously in favour of the creation of a new financial instrument with all the precautions that honesty requires that we take in a disaster situation .
I should also like to ask the Commission not to leave the Czech Republic and Slovakia out of its emergency aid plans .
I say that in the light of what we have done in the budget in previous years .
I can assure you that it was highly prized in the Czech Republic .
At the same time , account must be taken of the Council &apos;s first reading of the 2003 budget .
Whilst it left the Council very happy , we in Parliament realised that we had probably made an enemy of the Commission by agreeing to that deal .
The Council has not itself been prepared to implement the reductions forced upon others . When the Council has cut back on jobs in other institutions , it has not cut back on jobs within the Council itself .
The Community contribution is EUR 1 639 151 .
If one motorway company has saved money over a number of years in order to be able to offer a better solution , then my question is , why can we not leave it to the motorway companies to decide if they wish to offer technical alternatives in order to improve traffic across the Alps ?
I agree that I have said nothing new .
Do you have some special right and can you explain it to me ?
Only then shall we be able to take a decision on our initiative to review EU legislation on visas .
All three have their particular value and something special to contribute .
Because the necessary modifications can be discussed annually and therefore this does not cause any difficulty , as I said earlier to Mr Goebbels , and if a change in circumstances or an institutional change requires the problem to be reassessed , this can clearly be done .
This is a crucial measure .
The Commission will propose a certain number of rules ensuring that the promoter acts in this regard .
Parliament should therefore support the proposal to simplify and clarify the rules on granting aid in the context of employment promotion .
This is the situation , regardless of the future position of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union , within the scope of the Treaty or outside it .
The role of public bodies is , indeed , decisive , both in terms of training specialised staff and in terms of the provision of information on and prevention of acts of violence and abuse perpetrated against women and children .
We look forward to receiving your individual comments .
It is important to emphasise that the EU and the countries of Europe do not have any quarrel with the Iraqi people .
We have to think constructively about what can and should justify intervention by the international community in the internal affairs of a sovereign state .
Frankly , as the Commissioner said , our task would be a lot easier if the US showed the same focus on resolving the crisis in the Middle East , as it does on removing Saddam Hussein .
Mr President , first of all I welcome this debate this morning .
We must send a very strong signal to Saddam Hussein that we stand together on this .
I do not feel there is any division here , as has already been said , as regards condemnation of Saddam Hussein and his regime .
There are certainly other regimes that we would like to see overturned !
Since the end of the Gulf War , America and Britain have , in fact , never called a halt to their air attacks on Iraq and have caused , by imposing sanctions - a genuine crime against humanity - the poverty and death of civilian populations and , according to the UN , the death of more than one million children .
For a former parliamentarian , all these debates with planned speaking times have been a misery .
A further 116 000 have returned from Iran .
They can grow opium poppies in this drought .
I think that we have done the wrong thing .
No wonder that the successful consumer is inundated with advertising , including from abroad .
There is no doubt that we have to do this in order to bring peace to this country once under Soviet Communist occupation and ravaged by decades of civil war and thus make a contribution to consolidating the crisis region between Pakistan , Iran , India and the unstable Asiatic part of the former Soviet Union .
Firstly , we must restore the role , responsibility and visibility of the United Nations .
The remarks made about the International Security Assistance Force underline the importance of the role that has been undertaken by the military in extending security .
The Commission , as Parliament will know , also intends to open an office in Taipei very soon , probably around the end of the year .
Please allow me to pick out from the abundance of issues that have been mentioned , just three on which I believe it important to us in Parliament that the Heads of State and of Government in Europe and Asia should bring forth definite results .
This initiation will repress all things Tibetan unless the EU works to counteract it .
I should now like to turn to dialogue @-@ related issues .
Let me pick out a number of proposals .
Organisations forming part of civil society ought to play a decisive role in the distribution of food aid so as to prevent such aid being misused for political ends .
I should merely like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office a straight question : what message is the presidency of the Council of the European Union sending Turkey .
It would be helpful if Mr Haarder could deny that this is the case and state clearly that no one has yet been turned away from the Danish border during the Danish presidency .
At the same time , it was emphasised that the principle of specific actions in an agreement should be viewed in the context of the work being undertaken in the Convention .
In Europe , we do have the problem that it is the Member States alone that decide on safety standards for nuclear power stations .
Any strategy for this region must have as its objective the facilitation of a sustainable policy and the progressive reduction of financial grants from the EU , principally through efficient charging for all public services .
The legal base for the agency is perfectly adequate and does not need to be amended .
It is , therefore , with considerable satisfaction that we welcome the Commission proposal for a directive of 5 July 2001 , on the status of third @-@ country nationals who are long @-@ term residents .
Many men and women have become paperless due to administrative acts , even when they have made a life for themselves in one of the countries of the European Union , often for more than five years , and they have worked there and often been much more useful to the community than a good many rich parasites .
The environmental organisations must also know they have an immense responsibility not to allow pettiness to inflate the importance of the rights granted to our citizens and the special status accorded the organisations themselves .
In the framework of that proposal , the content of Amendment No 10 could more appropriately be addressed in a horizontal way .
The idea that the entire production chain is to be monitored is increasingly taking root in different countries .
It is down to the farmers .
This legislation requires formal notification of the movement of pharmaceutical waste , which does not appear to have happened in this instance .
What are the Member States doing about their lifelong learning strategy ?
Training cannot replace a poor education and there is considerable risk that those with a strong education base will benefit further from lifelong learning and those without it will become even further marginalised .
I wish to add that the social partners and the Member States have given a commitment to establish common principles in the field of non @-@ formal training , a task that we are striving to see through .
Madam President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Gutiérrez @-@ Cortines on her particularly important report , for , as she herself has stressed , before us is the first document dedicated by the European Parliament to universities as recognised institutions .
. ( NL ) The promotion of citizenship of the EU , the core objective of this proposal , does not do a great deal for me .
If excessively restrictive provisions are introduced , there is a risk that the whole process of access to information and decision @-@ making could be impeded .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
The case has been closely followed by the EC and Member States and we made our concern clear at the highest levels from the beginning .
Mr President , Commissioner , as Christian Democrats , and as the PPE @-@ DE Group , our commitment to the defence of the value of human life and dignity , and the defence of the fundamental rights and freedoms required for that dignity , lead us once again to vigorously condemn the violations of human life and dignity represented by the death sentences - and , what is more , death by stoning - handed down in strict application of Islamic law ; and to urge the authorities responsible to show clemency in order to prevent the ignominy of the execution of such sentences .
President Mugabe has just returned to Harare from Johannesburg claiming support for his land policies .
But the icing on the cake is that even here there will be support for holding the West responsible for this situation and this poverty .
Your comments have been noted , we have your document and we will pass it on to Mr Prodi .
Mr President , on a point of order , from the reply you gave me you have misunderstood the point I wanted to make .
Ireland has had 30 years of terror , which effectively ended in stalemate .
Thirdly , we reject the demand that routine checking for grounds for exclusion be prevented in the course of the processing of asylum applications .
The rapporteur states - and I say this with the utmost respect - in the tone of the author of &apos; Alice in Wonderland &apos; that there is no proof that the right of asylum has been exploited to help terrorists enter the Union .
I freely acknowledge before the House , as I have always done , that finding a common level playing field on this legislation , even on minimum common rules , has been difficult in the Council .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , victim protection has already long been a topic of political discussion even at European level .
We have established a common market for goods and capital and made it work as a kind of rich playground .
That would not have been right for Parliament , and I am glad that the various parties to this agreement converged in this way .
The debate is closed .
I am therefore , together with my colleague Mrs Emilia Müller , introducing two new amendments on behalf of my group , namely Amendments Nos 50 and 51 to Article 4 , which have already been mentioned .
Moreover , during the vote we took in July to set a threshold of 0.5 % or 1 % for the adventitious contamination of GMOs , did we show impartiality ?
The precautionary principle must be the guiding principle .
This ban had a definite deadline - 1998 .
What you are achieving here will be catastrophic in its effect .
The Commission is proposing a reduction in the minimum number of compulsory scrutinies for commercial and industrial undertakings which have received an agricultural subsidy from the Community budget , for the disposal of agricultural surpluses from the internal market or for other purposes .
We know that a great deal goes wrong .
Concerning Amendment 5 , I have to stress that , as Member States are already required to send the Commission a list of beneficiaries , this part of the amendment is unnecessary .
I would like to congratulate you , Mr President , on permitting it and making it possible , and on giving your colleagues in the Bureau a good example to follow in the future .
The proposal extends the scope of existing Directives 70 / 156 / EEC and 80 / 1268 as regards the measurement of carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption .
The European Union must use its influence at international level , not to dilute the dynamic released by Cartagena , but to strengthen it .
With those few opening remarks , let me thank not only the Commission in general but also the individual Commissioners who are going to contribute to this debate .
The first refers to how we handle outstanding budget commitments , which now amount to something around EUR 110 billion .
It would be regrettable if this were the case .
It also takes two years of programming in order to reach EUR 60 billion .
The direction we must take is that of increasing payments and simplifying procedures .
The Commission welcomes the very constructive opinion of the LIBE Committee , which brings into the PDB the major political developments which have occurred since its presentation - such as the conclusions of the European Council of Seville - which obviously could not have been considered at the time our PDB was presented .
No one can question the priority given to Afghanistan .
On the funding of the Global Health Fund , as my colleague Mrs Schreyer has already said , the Commission will ensure that it will do what is expected .
For this more money is needed right away .
If we do not reinstate the estimates that the Court of Justice itself made , we will fail more and more often .
Ladies and gentlemen , where is the sense in all this ?
And , thirdly , that the Commission provide regulatory instruments which guarantee genuine equality in the conditions for implementing expenditure .
I would support the point made by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that greater effort should be made to safeguard and improve the quality of agricultural products .
What we are paying for is an agriculture that is environmentally sound , guarantees the highest levels of food safety and traceability and upholds standards of animal welfare .
I should like , incidentally , to make one more comment on this article , namely that , as I see it , it is becoming clear that agricultural policy has taken a turn for the better in those areas where there has been a willingness to implement appropriate reforms .
In order to advance the immediate aims of the Marco Polo Programme - those of improving the environmental performance of freight transport and reducing road congestion , albeit in a relatively small way - this lowering of subsidy thresholds is crucial .
Railways have a rough deal in the investment plans , and inland shipping even more so .
Another gem was the heading &apos; optimism in infrastructure capacity and logistical concepts &apos; .
New jobs and more employment must be created . Otherwise , the result is all talk and no action .
There is , however , no solution to unemployment in strengthening the role of the social partners to quote the rapporteur &apos; in all matters &apos; regarding the organisation of work and working conditions - though I am sure the trade unions are always looking for such an opportunity .
Finally , on the issue of policy coordination , it would be good to work on this very hard in the near future .
And then there are women .
I shall now turn to the report .
I too can fully endorse this assessment of her report .
In addition , there is an agreement to establish a ten @-@ year framework programme for sustainable production and consumption which tackles the crucial problem of the separation of economic growth from deterioration of the environment .
What is very encouraging - and you could call this &apos; EU leadership &apos; - is that we avoided a repetition of the disorganised &apos; agenda overload &apos; that was in fact the cause of the breakdown in Seattle .
Agriculture policy , for example , is still not included , but this could perhaps be included in the programme now since one year has passed .
My final point relates to political legitimisation , which concerned me , and I agree with my fellow MEPs .
The problem is that investment in their development is not sufficient and such treatments are still several years away .
Now we have to get a move on .
Something I found quite absent from Johannesburg was the issue of population growth and that of reproductive health .
A green label for sustainable timber and a red label for incorrectly produced timber .
It is extremely important to move closer to reality .
Recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 0287 / 2002 ) by Lord Inglewood , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , on the Council common position with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive concerning life assurance ( 7328 / 1 / 2002 - C5 @-@ 0230 / 2002 - 2000 / 0162 ( COD ) )
We must also pay attention , however , to areas in which bottlenecks occur and the factors causing these in these other modes of transport , so that the Marco Polo programme does not lead to a transfer of congestion from one mode of transport to another .
As far as the first question is concerned , progress has not been exactly spectacular .
The pressure for elections must be maintained .
It remains crucial , though , for a common foreign policy in Europe to become more important than the political leaders &apos; own national profile .
Mr Titley &apos;s report will go into this in greater depth .
There are many good things to say about Mr Brok &apos;s report .
You could say that the arena is now entirely open for us in this area .
For example , I should like to ask the Commissioner , what happens next with Galileo ?
My second comment has to do with the question raised by Mr Lagendijk .
We have provided funds in projects to support the broadest possible ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute and we have committed more money for that purpose .
This is where my group draws the line . And I would urge Mr Möller to draw the line there in respect of the Council &apos;s willingness to strike a compromise .
Yesterday , we learned that , in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention , Washington is not going to allow inspections to be carried out in US firms , despite the fact that a war is about to break out because of a very similar situation .
So , there are many good resolutions , and yet the issue remains and will without a shadow of a doubt be raised in the US : does Europe really wish to save South America ?
The only answer to poverty in Latin America is sustainable economic development .
They think that altering the vapour pressure might cause problems for engines . The proposal by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy that we should leave discussion of this issue until the next review of the directive in 2005 is therefore , I believe , a good compromise .
Why do we not use common sense ?
It would be very hard to tell people that they must change engines when they reach the sea .
At present , for example , there are rules limiting the number of boats on lakes to 100 or even 2 per lake .
Surely the reason we have so many of these counterfeit brands is because the genuine brands are prevented from being sold at the price that consumers want to buy .
They have usually responded properly , fully and promptly to the Ombudsman &apos;s inquiries and have been willing to accept the Ombudsman &apos;s friendly solutions and draft recommendations .
Lastly , his efforts have prompted us to organise more structured relations between complainants and the Commission in infringement procedures .
I want MEPs to be aware of the fact that the Ombudsman is pointing in this case not only to the Commission but also to Parliament .
The remarks about administrative discrimination on the grounds of age or gender are particularly regrettable .
The vote will take place at 12 noon .
For example , there is no internal market common to both Europe and Africa , which is why there can be no generally free movement of workers either .
But , as ever , it is all hot air and naïve idealism .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
Mass redundancies , insecurity , unemployment , poverty , the dismantling of public services ; that is what the IMF policy which the countries of Mercosur have implemented means .
This afternoon we have just one more debate .
We do not want to jump the gun .
Next year , the Commission also intends to adopt a communication on digital switch @-@ over .
Perhaps that is why Mr Poettering is looking a little pale , perhaps it is overwork .
Moreover , it will be a test of our commitment to our principles , for accession will force us to change as well as bringing big changes for the new Member countries .
I think this is the right way round if a debate like this is to be meaningful .
A reinforced monitoring system is necessary because the overview provided by the Commission clearly shows that there are deficiencies in the readiness of those applicant countries and we should be open about this .
( Applause )
Former enlargements have shown that prosperity has increased , both in the countries concerned and for EU citizens .
We should ask the Convention chaired by Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing to give it serious thought .
I am very grateful to you , Commissioner , for saying that it is not only Iraq which should do so , but we are talking about Iraq here today .
In my opinion , there are three main questions which we , as Europeans and democrats , must answer .
Such action could in fact , as emphasised yesterday by Philippe de Villiers at the French National Assembly , cause a sudden resurgence of Islamic extremism and the collapse of the international coalition constituted after September 11 .
And , the investigation to find out if Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction should extend to anyone who has provided materials or know @-@ how . They too must take their share of the blame .
The purpose of such an examination must be to ensure that the indicators reflect the core objectives of the revised guidelines .
That is hardly the way ahead .
Hopefully , the Commission will be able to pick up examples of good practice from these projects for others to make use of .
I can understand this wish for stability , and I fully share the view that there must be stability in the goals .
I want to say to Mr Bouwman that we in the Council should very much like to see the various socio @-@ political directives revised .
One item on the agenda for political dialogue is the question of Kabylie .
I believe that we should start by acknowledging in our resolution the suffering and tragedy , the hundreds of thousands who have died and the thousands who have disappeared .
There is always a vying between these two groups .
Madam President , the latest conflict in Côte d &apos;Ivoire comes , I believe , as no surprise to those who try constantly to follow the developments in that country .
We will work together with everyone else as quickly as possible , but it must also be clear that we will do this as thoroughly as possible .
European money must arrive quickly on the ground in order to assist victims at the time when they need it most .
It is our heartfelt wish here in Parliament that , in the future , this extraordinary aid will not have to be used , because financial measures cannot replace human lives and cannot put an end to the pain which feelings of loss can cause people .
We are now starting on current lawmaking processes , which is of course the first step .
Where we cannot be certain , we must be cautious and prudent .
I believe that this directive will create the conditions for climate change and the Kyoto Protocol to stop being a purely theoretical concern in Europe and become an essential strand of the environmental and economic policy of all the Member States .
Thirdly , the scheme must be effective .
In this case , as in so many other policy areas , the EU has touched in a positive way on every aspect of the lives of our citizens .
Everyone must be involved and the initial allocation of rights is free .
The telecommunications sector showed us that auctions are not to be recommended .

It is a very far @-@ reaching proposal as it bans the sale of these substances and all their possible mixtures to the general public .
I really regret this decision .
Why , therefore , has nothing happened ?
Still less does it mean enforcing the Pact inflexibly and dogmatically , regardless of changing circumstances .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by congratulating you , Mr President , on what has happened in Ireland .
Should the fact of having carried out these transfers , of paying pensions to people who have never contributed to the pension scheme , be taken into account , yes or no ?
Mr Prodi , I would like to encourage you not to stop this good work , and not to be lucid by halves .
It is interesting that applause came at once from the wrong quarter .
In the past , I have even had the courage to impose a Europe tax on my country - specifically labelled a Europe tax - because I feel that the citizens have to be given clear , accurate information .
This issue is closely linked to that of the future legal personality of the Union .
My second point concerns the combination of the Charter with the ECHR , which has spawned more difficulties than necessary .
Mr President , Mrs Lambert , ladies and gentlemen , the Lambert Report that we are today debating deals with a crucial proposal for a directive frequently referred to as the Directive on Qualifying for International Protection .
Furthermore , in order to introduce some coherence between the regulations and laws of the Member States and to define a platform for common standards , we are establishing , through this proposal for a directive , minimum standards on the definition and scope of the status of refugee .
It contains nothing about applicants being required to go back if they are not given permission to remain , nor does it contain measures to ensure that they do so .
The essence of &apos; asylum shopping &apos; , the essence of secondary movements lies in the competitiveness of subsidiary protection systems , to which we can add - please forgive me for saying so , ladies and gentlemen - that it is unfair to accuse the Commission of extending the concept of economic refugees by means of subsidiary protection .
Under the cooperation agreements , I refer to Action II of the Culture 2000 programme , we are currently supporting , and will do so for three years , six networks in the area of the theatre , three in that of dance , seven in that of music , a network in the area of the circus and two interdisciplinary networks , and this is for performing arts networks alone .
We all know that this responsibility is borne by the Fifteen , soon to be twenty @-@ five and more .
At the same time , it will facilitate the development of a competitive market in generics , and that means medicines at lower cost for European citizens .
To sum up , I must stress the importance of enlargement .
The first I shall mention is that of patient information .
The many amendments tabled in committee and now once again in the plenary are just one indication of how difficult this undertaking is .
Although this is a wholly unsatisfactory situation , we can use the review of pharmaceutical legislation to take steps in the right direction .
I regard homeopathic medicines in the same way .
I believe that this is a step in the right direction , but we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater .
The debate is closed .
I share the rapporteur &apos;s concern that the movement of young animals , which must present at least some element of risk , should be subject to the same constraints as that of other categories .
We German Social Democrats have therefore voted in favour of this report despite all these misgivings , partly because it would not have got through otherwise and this House cannot fail to deliver an opinion when consulted by the Council .
Private investors , bent on making a profit , will only become involved to the extent that they can make money , either directly or in the form of tax relief .
On the contrary , we think that the union needs better support among its citizens . Here information is a necessary lubricant .
My colleague responsible for this , Mr Barnier , held a seminar on this in order to establish what scope there is here .
I also want to thank Denmark , as the country holding the presidency , for its excellent levels of cooperation , as well as Commissioner Michaele Schreyer .
The financial plan should therefore be adjusted accordingly .
I also said that we need only one reading of the budget , and that would simplify the whole process .
In this context , however , I hope that the Member States concerned , and in particular the German Government , will now also announce their figures quickly .
This will also create employment , for the diversification of farming will certainly pose problems and require new goals to be set .
Also the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Terry Wynn , for the way he expedited the votes in some highly @-@ charged discussions recently .
The Council in its May resolution says it is committed .
While the World Food Programme is responsible for the basic foodstuffs ECHO is concentrating its assistance on supplementary food products in order to ensure a more varied diet .
Who will expect us to do that ?
Thank you , Commissioner , for your explanation .
Of course , the Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely , and if the problems recur , will place the matter on the agenda of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health to emphasise the importance of the proper removal of specified waste material , in other words , spinal cord , at slaughterhouse level , and to require strong corrective actions .
In this case , it is about the fact that anyone can put a chicken in a bag with a few grams of salt and claim that it is a preparation .
As has been said , agreements also need to be reached in these areas .
Mr President , despite attempts to make them otherwise , security and defence are matters for the European Council .
In my view , Parliament &apos;s objective over the last 15 years has been , first and foremost , to ensure that the scrutiny performed under the discharge procedure is a political scrutiny in the fullest sense of the word , in other words a power of scrutiny which is an expression of the taxpayers &apos; desire to ensure that public money is not wasted , and which is not just a technical formality .
The present system is just as opaque as that which went before it , and if there were any need of proof of this , it has been provided by the events surrounding the efforts towards a compromise on this proposal .
As he said , I have been very pleased with the way that our committees have worked together on this issue and , in particular , the cooperation with the rapporteur which has ensured that the points made by the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights have been fully taken on board .
I agree with that too .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
The report by Mr van Hulten whom I welcome and congratulate personally , therefore deserves the support of the European Parliament .
As we know , the agenda will be dominated by the important topic of enlargement and also , in this connection , the subject of Kaliningrad , in which the European Parliament has of course taken a great interest .
The issue that meets with the broadest agreement is net transfers . There is clear unanimity on two principles : firstly , on accession , the ten candidate countries must not find themselves in the position of net contributors ; and secondly , all expenditure commitments must fall within the strict limits set at Berlin .
Before a wedding , the pre @-@ nuptial agreement can be significant .
The decision taken by the people of Ireland underlines their strong commitment to European integration and enlargement of the European Union .
If we want to start relaxing visa policy radically should we not start with Turkey , which at least has candidate country status ?
Mr President , yesterday &apos;s and this morning &apos;s meetings and the meeting due to be held in the coming days in Brussels are all trial runs for Copenhagen , aimed at defining the European Union &apos;s position before the last sprint to complete negotiations .
This could potentially lead to tensions in the border regions .
They are equal members , but if it should be established that there is any corruption or fraud involving EU funds , the Commission should , in a transitional period , step in and take over the administration of subsidies , so that the money is paid out to those for whom it is intended .
Mr President , enlargement by ten new members puts the EU before major difficulties .
The situation as regards the safeguards is that I have told both the Council and , as recently as last week , the Dutch Government , that the new instrument on safeguards , which we are proposing , must be of limited duration .
Who can benefit from this confidentiality , however , and what purpose can it serve , other than to conceal the real situation from those living near to airports , from users and air transport staff , other than to safeguard the commercial and financial interests of airlines ?
Where I disagree is neither on these great aims nor on every patient &apos;s wish to have more rapid access , at Community level , to medicinal products containing new , safer and more effective active substances , but on certain specific details of the regulation , as demonstrated in the way I voted on this matter .
I have voted in favour of the report on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and its future status .
The Commission can only welcome the efforts made to improve analytical capabilities , especially as far as Europol &apos;s assessment of the terrorist threat is concerned , and particularly as regards the specific measures which have been taken to increase the amount of information provided to Europol , including the exchange between police forces and information services of the Member States , and to ensure that this tool for cooperation and analysis is improved and used more widely .
The primary and most important function of the Security Council is to be a way ahead in external policy matters , but it cannot be the only way .
The resolution gives its full approval for the EU &apos;s anti @-@ terrorism package , and that includes the EU &apos;s list of terrorist organisations .
We are , in fact , talking about a form of conflict prevention , which is surely the EU &apos;s general priority in its foreign policy .
What more can one add ?
Today , Commissioner , it is not enough to simply imprison the terrorists .
We need to use police and judicial tools , but they are not enough .
As a result , a Commission decision has been adopted containing security provisions and extensive rules on IT security .
I can , first of all , only deplore the decision by Parliament &apos;s Bureau not to promote the publication of the report .
At any rate I will send Members of Parliament the information in writing .
I must tell the Member who has just spoken - mixing a question on Gibraltar , Morocco and Spain with terrorism , with the victims , etc. that if anyone is truly working in the Basque country to overcome the situation of political conflict we have been experiencing for over three centuries - a political conflict with the Spanish State and with the centralist government in Madrid - and is trying precisely to ensure that there are no more attacks , murders or violence in the Basque country , it is the Basque nationalists .
It goes without saying that the Council has also taken full account of the views expressed by the elected representatives in the EU , both in the national parliaments and in the European Parliament .
In any case , I would like to ask him the following supplementary question : is there a will to work towards a rapprochement ?
But that apart , it is important that an official visit takes place .
I think most of the airlines have responded well to this debate , with the air service passenger commitment as a gesture of intent .
If there are not enough volunteers , however , and everyone wants to go home or to their business appointment and passengers are denied boarding , then they must have some legal redress .
Although we identify with the objectives they pursue and we are preparing proposals in relation to them , we regret that we cannot accept them and I would point out that , as Mr Vairinhos said a moment ago , information to users is absolutely essential if these rights are to be effective ; hence the campaigns we have carried out to date with the support of the airports and the tour operators , but also - and I must make this very clear - with the support of the airlines , which cooperated significantly in relation to the objective of improving the quality of service .
Mr President , agriculture , support for rural development and the protection of rural communities are at the heart of Mr Khanbhai &apos;s report and he addresses many of the fundamental inequities which feature so prominently in the lives of the rural poor .
Mr President , in this year 2002 during which the international community has met successively in Monterrey , Rome and Johannesburg , setting as a priority the challenge of leading two @-@ thirds of humanity out of the situation of hunger , poverty and under @-@ development that affects them , it seemed that the European Parliament was obliged to consider and adopt a position on how the European Union can support agricultural and rural development policies that contribute to the development of the countries of the South .
These include a proposal to include a species of true mahogany in the list in Appendix II and proposals on the improvement of CITES &apos; working methods .
The report concentrates mainly on the following three points :
I now turn to the draft ratification decision .
The Commission will also adopt the implementing regulations in a transparent way .
At the time , I congratulated Robert Goebbels , the rapporteur , and I would like to reiterate those congratulations now that we are at second reading stage .
It has already demonstrated that it does not understand how the media works .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have briefly summed up the Commission &apos;s objectives in presenting this proposal and I eagerly await the debate on this matter .
We have to ensure that decentralised renewable energy can access the network at a reasonable cost .
I will check this with all the political groups but , as I understand it , there is no problem .
We welcome the fact that the appropriation for combating HIV / AIDS is up by approximately EUR 200 million , or 60 % , on the Council &apos;s proposal .
.
Basically , on one side , there are the advocates of multifunctional farming , of which I am one , who find it unacceptable that 80 % of Community aid should end up in the purses of 20 % of the farmers , and , on the other side , there are the defenders of the status quo .
I hope that will continue at COP 8 in India .
We must get the WTO to agree to allow us to keep certain products off the European market if they have been manufactured using processes that cause additional climate change .
The issue at stake then was not whether genetic engineering should or should not be used ; the issue at stake was labelling and the inclusion of this seed directive and its methods in the release directive , which at the time was still Directive 90 / 220 .
Now for a brief material comment .
Will they deny that GM crops have major environmental benefits ?
The Human Rights Convention was adopted and the Court of Human Rights was created here in Strasbourg .
What we do say is that it is good that they want to talk ; let us hold a comprehensive dialogue and , if we see improvements , only then should we refrain from tabling new resolutions in due course .
Its format will be assessed immediately after the first session and could be revised , as necessary , in the spring of 2003 .
I invite you now to observe a minute &apos;s silence in their memory .
First of all , for some of the accession countries , the question of financial provision is a very difficult one .
We have in fact held a working meeting with Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing , but we have not raised the issue of the review of the Euratom Treaty .
Nothing in what the future Member States seek is fundamental from our point of view , but it can be fundamental to them and to their ability to win the support they need , and so I very much hope that we will all - by which I mean the Council , the Commission , and Parliament - summon up the flexibility that will be needed if the project is to be a success , not only for politicians like us , but most especially for those who really matter - the people in the present and future Member States .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Prodi , President of the Commission , my group is broadly in favour of enlargement , because we see it as an historic opportunity to bring together the peoples of Europe , to consolidate peace on the continent and to transform this Union of 25 Member States - and in future 27 or 30 States - into the new global player that all those who oppose the excessive liberalism and unilateralism of American leaders would dearly love to see .
Finally , as a former chairman of the Lithuanian JPC , I would remind the Council that Russia is not a Member State of the European Union , it is not a candidate country , it does not have a veto over European Union affairs .
That is why we reaffirm our support for Commissioner Fischler &apos;s proposals and we support the idea of a mid @-@ term review , which can alone enable us to redefine the future prospects for all farmers , and not just for large cereal producers .
I am positive that at some point - be it before or after integration - this development will help resolve the political problem that has beset Cyprus for years .
This applies to Chechnya , where our human rights agencies working in situ are constantly reporting incidents of failure to respect human rights and violation of human rights by both Russian military operators and Chechen rebels .
It is to be hoped that the new Palestinian cabinet will continue with the reform work it has started and will , with the help of the international community , not only intensify it , but also use it to bring about marked improvements in the people &apos;s conditions .
And to the Palestinians we must say : twenty years ago , we said you must acknowledge not only the State of Israel but also that there would be no mass return of Palestinians to that State of Israel .
Mr President , although the lack of political will to date by the Sharon government , which has recently resigned , and its use of the security argument as a pretext have prevented the reopening of the peace process , this process could now peter out entirely .
The vote , which was won by a substantial majority , shows , if this were necessary , its members &apos; concern to go beyond political and national divisions in order to present comments capable of influencing the debates .
Where nuts are concerned , the producer countries clearly expressed a need for special subsidies in this sector .
If enlargement and the new economic situation make cuts necessary , these cuts must not be to the detriment of the very sectors and small farmers at risk , who are already in great difficulties now , for otherwise , paradoxically , we may well find our countryside full of people fleeing the towns , certainly not young farmers .
The first is for protection against imported food and the second is for a guaranteed annual subsidy to be available to the farming industry as a whole .
In their future proposals for regulations , the Commission should present criteria that take account of impediments due to difficult natural conditions as well as what is needed for the implementation of environmental programmes .
Thirdly - and as a response , too , to some of the questions raised this evening - what is stated is without prejudice to the international commitments entered into by the European Union , for example in the launching of the next Doha Round , the ways and means of which are to be in place before the end of March of next year .
We would ask the Commission and the Council to reassess the KEDO project in light of these events .
The Vice @-@ President has accepted the amendments tabled on behalf of the Commission . There is clear determination in the Council to ensure that the package is approved at first reading .
Mr President , Madam Vice @-@ President of the Commission , whenever we debate the crisis in the Balkans , which of course has now become a gentler , more correctly defined form of crisis , we are all the wiser for it .
One principle we agreed upon was that of &apos; one programme - one fund &apos; .
I think this proposal is a daring move ; it will make it easier to apply the principle of subsidiarity and cut out a lot of unwanted red tape .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
It is the intention that political consensus be reached on the whole package concerning the internal market for electricity and gas at the meeting of the Energy Council on 25 November .
We have only a year left to implement the internal market strategy for 1999 / 2004 , a year in which we will need greater seriousness of purpose in place of half @-@ heartedness , more speed in place of hesitancy and greater responsibility for the whole rather than parochialism .
Privatisation is not the concern of the European Union and is not the concern of the Commission .
He was given no reasons for his dismissal .
That is where the problem lies , and this is not , therefore , a matter of cooperation in the field of security , which obviously goes without saying .
This resolution , however , pleads in favour of an outmoded system . It still underlines the need to guarantee prices , while for years this has proven to be fatal to the sound functioning of the market .
Monday :
I shall say for the record that after the debate on this matter on the last occasion , I communicated on behalf of Parliament our sincere condolences to the relevant authorities , which was the request made of the presidency at that time .
Yet the Commission has not explored the idea of cross @-@ media ownership and media concentration in any detail since its 1994 follow @-@ up to the Green Paper on pluralism and media concentration .
Indeed it is one of the core values underlying the European Union , as enshrined in Article 11 ( 2 ) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which refers explicitly to protecting the pluralism of the media .
During the recent hearing organised by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats on television without frontiers , a reporter noted that television is exacerbating the commercialisation of sport and the concentration of advertising resources .
The proposal is intended to replace the previous directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship , annulled by the European Court of Justice two years ago .
Consequently , printed matter circulating solely within the territory of one Member State has no cross @-@ border effects and cannot create any obstacle to the internal market or serious distortion of competition .
Thus , some Members seem to think that the existence of borders can have positive economic effects , whereas in many cases , it is the same individuals who are recommending the same borders be broadly opened up , regardless of the consequences .
If we were to restrict tobacco advertising even further than has been proposed by the Commission , our ambition would run up against the bounds of our authority , and we would risk a new judgment .
Mr President , I am taking the floor instead of Mr Lipietz , who should have been presenting this report on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , with his customary flair .
The economic and social consequences of these decisions are so great that they cannot be taken lightly .
I think that we have a sound basis to vote on this report in Parliament .
These activities must , therefore , pay close attention to the state of stocks and not be undertaken in a predatory way or in the form of simple hunting and gathering , as if we were still living in the Stone Age .
As Europe &apos;s Parliament , though , we should be concentrating on the points of fact and attempting to play an active part in fashioning a reform whose prime objective will be to maintain fishery resources .
It is no doubt evident to all that this is a challenge to Europe .
Furthermore , although there is no proof that the national area is the best suited to combating international organised crime , nor will it ever be proven that freedoms are best protected within the strict framework of national borders .
That will provide time for the ratification of the accession treaty and , at the same time , enable the new Member States to participate on an equal footing in the elections to the European Parliament .
That is a unilateral demand on the part of Turkey , and neither I nor the Commission are willing simply to give in to a situation in which the other side steps up the pressure and says : &apos; If you do not give in to this pressure , you are causing a crisis in relations between us . &apos; 
Ladies and gentlemen , such things could never have been achieved if they had wavered or doubted .
It is the achievements today that count and this is on which we should base our judgment .
We are then , to take one example , talking in terms of a Budget framework with some EUR 15 billion of expenditure in 2006 , but , on the other hand - as we so often forget - we will have our own resources , amounting to some EUR 5 billion , which the new Member States will already have contributed to the European Union &apos;s Budget .
Quite apart from the practicalities of the problem , I therefore again call on the Commission and the governments to do everything possible to make what are at present border regions workshops for European integration and enable them to experience its positive effects on people and society , as the former border regions such as for example the Saarland , Lorraine , and Luxembourg so emphatically did .
The Helsinki Council made Turkey an official candidate country .
I would like to take this opportunity to express one regret and voice one hope .
Mr President , although we meet together this afternoon as representatives of the Member States , our concern is obviously for our friends , the candidate countries .
None of the fundamental problems of what is termed eastward enlargement has been solved .
A positive example is the report by Mr Jan Mulder in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
The closures of the nuclear power plants at Ignalina and Kozloduy both require an energy strategy which takes neighbouring countries into account .
We must extend paragraph 24 of the Brok report to all areas and regions of the European Union , since enlargement must not have negative repercussions for any Community territory .
I should like to thank you for your commitment and support .
Secondly , with regard to the economic issue , which is absolutely central , we can see that the spirit of Lisbon and Gothenburg are still alive within the Commission .
However , in order to be politically united and cohesive , Europe needs to address issues of momentous historical importance transparently .
This is the way we must approach the issue .
Thirdly , in Doha you took on the obligation to table proposals for the reduction of the agricultural subsidies and their conversion into rural subsidies before March 2003 .
I am not referring to poor Commissioner Wallström and Commissioner Byrne , who always do their best but are sometimes pushed to one side .
We do not want to impinge on your rights , but please respect ours !
In this regard , I would like to say that the Commission will continue to work with Parliament and also , of course , with the Council . In this way we will manage to find a conclusion on this issue .
As I announced yesterday , the General Affairs Council recommended the day before yesterday at its meeting in Brussels that accession take place on 1 May , and that the brand new Commission , including Commissioners from the new Member States , take office on 1 November , so that the new Parliament has enough time to approve the new Commissioners .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0382 / 2002 ) by Francesco Rutelli , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the initiative of the Kingdom of Denmark with a view to the adoption of a Council framework decision on combating corruption in the private sector ( 10689 / 2002 - C5 @-@ 0376 / 2002 - 2002 / 0817 ( CNS ) )
In keeping with what I said yesterday , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece had no choice but to vote against the Brok report . Especially as today &apos;s vote was rejected by a conservative majority :
I therefore call on the Commission to present a proposal to regulate these two types of crime .
As long as this schizophrenia continues , voting on moralising resolutions is pure hypocrisy and I shall have no part in it .
The Union must make efforts to approximate criminal law and procedures on money laundering and the confiscation of goods .
- ( DA ) Mr President , the tenth EU @-@ Russia Summit took place in Brussels on 11 November with satisfactory results .
Now too conditions in Russia are stabilising , except with regard to certain aspects , which I shall return to .
How to deal with the ambivalence of Moscow &apos;s policy ?
We are right to condemn the clearly disproportionate brutality of the methods used by the Russian authorities . However , we would get a better hearing if we did not ignore the real basis of Moscow &apos;s reaction , which does not pertain solely to Russian concerns .
I do not , however , think that there is any reason to admonish the Council or the Presidency for the way in which they handled this very difficult summit which has just taken place .
The Commission appreciates that the mission was able to carry out its task in full compliance with internationally accepted criteria used for election observation .
That was bound to lead to tensions .
The parties stated in the declaration of the European Council in Laeken that the Standing Committee on Employment was not living up to its aims and that the parties would like to see the committee replaced by an established practice of holding tripartite social summits .
We are also aware that certain governments do not want to see any extension of parliamentary powers in the convention process .
In conclusion , I would like to express my hope that the European Parliament &apos;s final position on this issue will take account of the actual opportunities open to the Council and the assurance of goodwill that I have given the European Parliament today .
Nor are we fundamentally opposed to extending it .
Before we condemn the American system , we must first remember that the overall fall on the Dow Jones index this year has been 16 % , while in the euro area the stock exchange indexes have recorded a fall of 34 % .
I would like to emphasise that after the global economic downturn which started through the collapse of the new technology market , what was stunningly shown in the United States was the danger of laisser faire regulation in a booming market .
Therefore we must monitor the developments in the candidate countries because there is an essential need for an independent regulatory and supervisory agency there .
We will find that European consumers are consuming meat from poultry produced in China and Thailand containing substances banned in Europe .
Concerning the external dimension of the phasing out process , let me clarify my position .
A different situation applies to rational phytopharmaceuticals .
As to Mr Nisticò &apos;s claims , the US General Accounting Office has examined the FDA data which he uses .
I thank Mr Koukiadis for doing the decent thing and laying down his report .
We have been told by certain major agencies , some of the largest operating in the European Union , that they do not oppose a regulation , which is not what the Confederation of British Industry and others would have us believe .
Temporary workers everywhere should at least benefit , from the first day of their contract , from the same working conditions , pay and holiday entitlements as the staff employed by the company using the temporary workers .
That is actually what it is all about .
At a time when national markets are fast turning into European markets and we are on the threshold of enlargement , highly diverse labour legislation and differing rights from one country to another are obviously creating distortions on the internal market .
The adoption of Parliament &apos;s report and the forthcoming Council conclusions will provide the essential political backing for the effective implementation of the strategy at European level .
We have no products which are successful and are accepted in the market .
The EIB can play an important macro @-@ economic role and underpin EU policy in key areas .
The EIB is to promote economic and social cohesion within the EU by financially supporting the goals which the European Union has in mind .
In the United Kingdom , pension funds have already invested in long @-@ term EIB bonds .
International action , to which you have just referred , does not present any more of a problem .
Secondly , in conjunction with this , we adopted a series of demands in the Committee on Industry , which are addressed to the Commission .
This is , after all , about fair competition in which a battle can be fought for first place , but also for honour .
It fights measures that distort competition and it is a precondition for all companies to have fair opportunities in and on the market .
These are predominantly specialist , and often very small , businesses that use an existing brand to market new products .
No they are not !
Above all , I would call for the European Investment Bank &apos;s funds to be increased in order to finance the construction of the stretch of road and railway between Skopje and Sofia , which is completely non @-@ existent at present , something which is preventing the swift completion of Corridor 5 , so important for work in the whole of the Balkan area .
Although those services are vital to the well @-@ being of people and the conservation of our environment , they are , in many cases , running at a constant loss .
However , the Commission and my colleague Mrs Wallström particularly want to express our appreciation of the European Parliament &apos;s ongoing support for the EU &apos;s position in international climate negotiations and your continuing interest in this issue .
The Commission was very good to us in that it gave us briefings outside the loop , but we need to be inside the loop if we are to be involved and if we are to be described as &apos; members as participants in the European Community delegation &apos; .
We are eager to move what could be termed the lanes of death further away from where they now are . We want to prevent our sea from becoming a sewer .
We voted on two blocks of measures .
That is enough !
Well , that is my point .
I would therefore call upon the Council and the Commission to proceed extremely cautiously during the EU Troika mission to Sudan , planned for 9 and 10 December .
The European Union is very concerned about the general human rights situation and the continued reports of torture and deaths in custody , following the launch of Operation Clean Heart , aimed at halting the decline in law and order in Bangladesh , to which several Members referred to a few minutes ago .
I would also like to table a point of order , before moving on to the vote , which will be a joint one concerning the whole text , because there are some linguistic corrections which I would like to point out to the services , since we have worked very quickly and some errors have slipped in which I will now mention , Mr President .
The launch of the Integrated Management and Control System has not been completed , and almost half of the Member States have not introduced the bovine identification system , which has been compulsory since 2000 .
I would also like to address a few words to the principal rapporteur , Mr Casaca .
Members of the Court of Auditors , you know that I am on good terms with the Court .
I think you have probably heard a host of political speeches in this Parliament today about the Court of Auditors &apos; reports and how people are framing themselves , looking forward to discharge .
At the meeting , the Chairman of the Convention will brief the European Council on the status of the Convention &apos;s work , and , in addition , the European Council will meet with the President of the European Parliament , Mr Cox .
What is on the agenda at Copenhagen ?
I wish the summit of Heads of State and Government under Danish presidency great success , in order that we may tackle the issues that remain to be resolved .
Does this not conflict with what Denmark , amongst others , supported when the list of terrorist organisations was first discussed , which was that resistance movements comparable with the ANC or the Danish resistance movement must under no circumstances end up on the list of terrorist organisations ?
We believe that an acceptable solution would be for them to have the same status for the purposes of the IGC that they have for the purposes of the Convention .
I am sure , Commissioner Verheugen , that you will explain this as a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation and , quite rightly , point out that this represents a breach of the confidentiality you presumably agreed on .
We have learnt that these are political decisions .
That is the full background .
The ball lies in Parliament &apos;s court .
We have thought for a long time that this proposal offers a good compromise between several objectives .
It is political because this Parliament , despite the fact that there have been seven disasters similar to that of the Prestige over the last twenty years off the Galician coast , did not have the courage to lay down legislation similar to the United States &apos; Oil Pollution Act , so that we could prevent this type of vessel , which are time bombs operated by criminal capitalist mafias , from moving through these waters .
Fourthly , we want the fishing industry to be more closely involved in decision @-@ making in the regional advisory councils .
We have fished ourselves into a catastrophe .
Tour operators are starting to think , as a way out , of offering disaster tourism , as we in Galicia are very fond of black humour .
The conclusions of the Varela report are heading in the same direction and this we welcome .
I do , however , have some observations to make .
In my view , however , it is not because the money is public money that fish are disappearing !
I am delighted that many here are in favour of stepping up controls and the implementation of a common fisheries policy and gladly accept Amendments Nos 51 , 57 and 61 .
No it does not !
We shall be presenting an initial communication in January 2003 and both these documents , the communication on the revision of the employment strategy and the draft joint report , which we submitted a month ago , will be the two basic political papers and will need to be debated so that we can get to the spring Council and then start applying the new procedure with the guidelines .
If it should be the case that this is not just a coincidence but a trend , the balance and the harmony which seemed to follow from the Lisbon decisions will be replaced by conflict on the labour market and what we used to call class struggle .
I now hope that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party will support this compromise and so confirm what its MEPs normally say in the committee , namely that , when there is scientific data and clear evidence that an issue constitutes a problem for workers , we must also legislate to solve that problem .
Also , enormous progress has been made in scientific knowledge and practice .
I also feel that we need to look very carefully in this Directive at exactly how the process of experimentation will go in the future .
We naturally have a responsibility to help the victims and give them the opportunity of a better life .
We therefore have two proposals for reform .
It is a strong assertion of the Commission &apos;s orthodox function and it should shift the debate about where a power lies , centre stage inside the Convention .
It is at long last before us , and we welcome that .
It would lead to a marked weakening of Parliament &apos;s role , as up to now the Commission has been accountable to Parliament alone , and Parliament alone has been able to dismiss the Commission .
And what does the Commission say ?
Nothing more .
The consumer should be able to support home production , if this is their wish .
To sum up , I shall say that , once again , I am surprised by the European logic which prevails in the area of common policy .
The Varela report is highly critical of the Commission &apos;s proposal .
To grant a renewable six @-@ month temporary residence permit to illegal immigrants who would help the authorities of Member States to combat the illegal @-@ immigration networks is totally unsatisfactory .
It comprises three hundred and seventy @-@ four million Europeans who have decided to join hands to build together a far more integrated world , which goes beyond business and trade .
( Applause )
My speech is available and the groups may wish , on institutional points in particular , to raise some of these issues in the course of our debate with the Council .
Nor should we be surprised if the words of Bush senior come true . He said that , if it is in the interests of the United States , they will support and create terrorist organisations .
This is the first achievement on which the rapporteur is to be congratulated .
As regards the constitutional level , it is my view that there will have to be a less cumbersome review procedure for the second part of the constitution .
This is , as a matter of fact , the type of information that Europol is already authorised to request and obtain directly from Member States .
Furthermore , there are still doubts and uncertainties about the effect of small inhaled doses and the limit and percentage of risk beneath which it is certain that cancer will not be caused , and the difference in risk between chrysotile asbestos - which seems to be less harmful - and amphibole asbestos , as well as the concern to prohibit the use of asbestos in work relating to the repair , refurbishment and restoration of buildings .
This morning in the United Kingdom , in our flagship news programme , the Today Programme , unusually the question of asbestos was raised at another reasonable hour .
We believe that it is right for Parliament to be consulted .
The picture of the radioactive sources posing safety risks and risks to security through the acquisition of radioactive materials by terrorists seeking to make dirty bombs has been banished from the committee &apos;s view .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner Byrne , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start with very warm thanks to all the colleagues who did serious work in the committee and on the report .
The final comment I would add is that research is an area which we are entitled to expect to provide us with some results , on the condition that we provide it with the resources .
I would suggest therefore that , before leaping into the usual role of telling everyone else what is going wrong , the Commission this time spends its time examining why , when the chips were down , it performed so badly .
The only long @-@ term solution which will not jeopardise the agricultural economy of the Member States or wipe out entire livestock holdings is to abolish capitalist profit from production and introduce adequate border and other controls , contrary to the demands of the multinationals which have managed to get them lifted .
This means that , if a decision on vaccination is to be made , it will be a political decision and not a decision based on scientific and veterinary fact .
You never know what is going to happen .
But I seem to remember that when we were elected in 1999 our greatest concern was how we made our debates relevant to our electors .
There is much anecdotal evidence in the UK that large amounts of illegal meat are still entering the country .
I do not appear to have a set at my desk and I must apologise to Mrs Thors , my Finnish is not that great .
More generally speaking , the report also raises the issue of how to achieve better reconciliation between one &apos;s career and family life , to the benefit of children as well as working men and women , through the establishment in each Member State of crèche and nursery facilities , for example .
They have emerged over the course of fifty years via treaties , ordinances and directives , with the Court of Justice having to act as arbiter .
All the Member States must also , as we are requesting , carry out regular farm inspections in order to ensure that the general rules on sanitary control and biosecurity are effectively understood and applied .
In spite of these deficiencies , I think we have a lot to be satisfied with .
As I have already emphasised , the 2003 Budget is the last for an EU of 15 Member States . We now have to adapt the Financial Perspective to the Copenhagen conclusions , in order to draw up the 2004 Budget for an EU of 25 Member States .
The budget has a special flexible instrument , but it would appear that the Council misuses it for payments that can be predicted instead .
We were then told that there had actually been an evaluation .
But if a Council decision takes the funds , agreement to which had been reached in this House by a great deal of effort , and transfers them back to a development that we do not want , that , Commissioner , is not in accordance with Parliament &apos;s intentions .
It is fair to point out that the efforts to reach an agreement in the July conciliation were successful and will allow us to vote in favour of the 2003 budget tomorrow .
On that occasion , 11 common objectives were set covering the adequacy of pensions , their financial sustainability and the modernisation of pension systems to adapt them to changes on the labour market and in society , notably to ensure that they cater well for the needs of women .
May I remind you that one of the basic objectives of the employment strategy is to integrate older people .
If that produces good results , I think that might in future be something that the Member States or third countries will be able to take over from us .
Mr President , the figure the Commissioner has given is EUR 40 million , apparently for the period 2002 @-@ 2004 .
With regard to the trade in nuclear materials with Russia , the Commission proposes to present a proposal for a negotiation mandate for the approval of the Council , in accordance with its right to initiative .
For example , in 2000 , the projects received co @-@ funding of approximately EUR 3 million from the trans @-@ European networks budget and around EUR 16 million from the Cohesion Fund .
I should certainly like to ask in future for a far clearer and more enforceable framework of agreements .
That is the main cause of our poverty .
Thirdly , does the solution not lie in the remuneration of donors , as certain European States already practise this system ?
My question to you this evening , although I do not know whether you can answer it , is : what solutions do we now have available ?
That was the appropriate response in those circumstances .
The hurdles we have set in this directive today are not very high , but they are nevertheless defined and binding .
In that respect , we are a strong Parliament and a strong delegation in the negotiations .
The rapporteur can be truly proud of his work and he is to be congratulated on it .
In other words , when reason fails , we must invoke legal , or even criminal , liability .
We have had our differences , but the cooperation between us has been characterised by progress , results and a willingness to compromise .
I would also like to say that the President of the European Parliament , Pat Cox , placed himself at the head of a movement that made a deep impression on the candidate countries .
I have just one comment to make with regard to Turkey : I believe our Turkish friends should be told that they missed a great opportunity , during the week of the Sakharov Prize , to let Mrs Leila Zana come here .
I do not think there should be any meeting with Russia without us telling them that what is going on in Chechnya is not only bad , it amounts to a colonial war .
The fact that the door was so clearly opened to Bulgaria and Romania was also historic , as was the signal given to Turkey .
What will remain after the success of Copenhagen will actually , despite all the presidency &apos;s efforts , be a residual insecurity and , in the end , the hope that the heavily pregnant Convention will in the foreseeable future give birth to something that can serve as a basis for further improvements .
The border will lengthen by hundreds of kilometres in 2004 .
Instead of discrimination , whether positive or negative , there is a progress report by the Commission , and consultation in Parliament and in the Council as to whether the results justify the inception of negotiations .
As in numerous other instances , the consequences of that rebellion were - in English for the benefit of my British colleagues - an &apos; independence of sorts &apos; , but an independence accompanied by the partition of two nations , with the colonial power playing one off against the other on the basis of the classic principle of divide and rule .
My last comment is this : you had a visit from Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing , and I have the honour of being a member of the Convention .
However , blood also indicates nobility , when it is blue , and we have to admit that the rapporteur , Mr Nisticò , is not lacking in nobility .
Mr President , the Commission , and I shall end here , understands that there are various levels and timetables .
Moreover , we must on no account disregard the fact that many Nature 2000 areas are affected by this disaster .
Never again !
Should we prevent them ?
It then continues by expressing satisfaction with the Commission &apos;s work in respect of the economic , social and environmental consequences of the loss of the Prestige .
However , Mr Galeote , from one Spaniard to another , I will define what I think of your attitude by means of two traditional sayings .
However , the harmonisation being attained is worth our effort .
We believe that we should have some common standards at European level for decisions to return people ; I therefore hope we will be able to present some specific proposals on this topic fairly soon .
Mr President , there are two aspects to this issue : firstly , the problem of excluding unwanted migrants from the European Union - or at least controlling their access ; and , secondly , the reasons for migration .
Mr President , there is certainly no lack of suggestions when it comes to asylum policy , suggestions which can provoke feelings either of fear or of excessive generosity and tolerance .
I also support Mr Watson &apos;s approach in that we must emphasise the dimension of fundamental rights within the framework of the re @-@ admission agreements .
Question No 4 by Jonas Sjöstedt ( H @-@ 0729 / 02 ) :
Will enlargement have a negative impact on the least @-@ favoured regions ?
The Community projects instrument will receive 80 % support , and those things done at national level alone will receive 50 % co @-@ financing .
Therefore , whatever the fine rhetoric that might flow from this House , the true aim of this particular European Year is to promote further European integration .
If , as in this case , you gaze fixedly at the European Court of Justice in the same way that a rabbit gazes fixedly at a snake , you are not acting as if all options were available to you .
This is not surprising , because the governments , and , therefore , the Council , are pushing in this direction because of the existence of a clear conflict of interests .
The Commission is , indeed , very behind and we can only wonder what this means .
If you are to refuse an electronic check on the third part of Amendment 139 , which was properly called for immediately after that vote was announced , I would be grateful if you could explain to the House on what basis you are refusing that check .
. ( FR ) I voted against the Watson report , which endorses the agreement signed between the European Community and Hong Kong on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation , because it is accompanied by a very dangerous parallel provision : the exemption of Hong Kong citizens from the visa requirement .
With regard to Portugal in particular , this debate will certainly take account of the specific characteristics of Portuguese farming and the abnormally low income of Portuguese farmers as a consequence of our only joining the European Community in 1986 , when the other Member States had been benefiting from it since 1962 .
As we did in the last annual report , we have taken care , in the report on 2001 , to take your comments and proposals into account .
The Joint Report on Employment for 2001 states that the Member States have taken only limited measures to reduce this pay differential , and the Commission needs to play an active role here , especially with the prospect of enlargement .
As you know , several states participating in the Alpine Convention have not yet ratified the protocols .
Up to now , the European Union has viewed its policy on mountain regions as part of agricultural policy .
Yet the Chinese authorities are insisting on the implementation of Article 23 . Mark you , this is an article that was given its current form only after the bloodbath in Peking &apos;s Tienanmen Square .
Today the same is happening on our very doorstep . And we just stand and watch .
Madam President , things did indeed get off to a promising start .
It is not the task of politicians to determine how private employers take their recruitment decisions in the light of these considerations .
The international community must act on this issue immediately .
We are in favour of a more prominent role for the Committee of the Regions provided that the interinstitutional balance remains as it is today .
No doubt that will be where the votes will be concentrated on Wednesday .
Democratic government in Europe cannot exist if cultural diversity and regional differences are not taken into account .
The report by Mr Napolitano has arrived at an opportune moment , a few weeks before the debate on this in the Convention on 6 and 7 February .
My question is : will the Commission investigate the opportunities for doing so ?
Mr President , every day in Spain we see a horrendous tragedy involving people who come looking for a better life .
We endorse the content of the report and , above all , the courageous approach the rapporteur has adopted in naming , giving specific , practical details , the States which have violated human rights or have not signed or ratified international conventions on the protection and safeguarding of human rights .
We are not perfect .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what we are dealing with here is the integrated management of our external borders , which is where , I am sure that we are all agreed , security , for the European Union , begins .
Therefore , the rapporteur is right to propose to call upon all the countries to work together to contribute to and bear the costs of external border controls , whether they have external borders or not .
The Agency is the cornerstone , it will complete the circle and will be the instrument which will allow us to make progress in the field of the interoperability of rail safety and therefore to guarantee the integration of the European rail network .
Despite the fact that Mr Markov and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs proposed reducing driving time to 45 hours , the limit remains at 56 hours , which is clearly still far too long .
I do not need to emphasise this particularly , but I do think that we should take them seriously .
A third is that the car is one of the few remaining freedoms in an increasingly regulated society .
The further liberalisation of Europe &apos;s oldest mechanised infrastructure , the railways , is an essential stimulus for a sector that is quickly losing ground in the European goods traffic market .
I frankly believe not ; that is not the way forward .
I myself can see that there is poor compliance in my own country .
A study by the European Safety Council shows that more than 50 % of drivers admit that they have fallen asleep at the wheel at least once in their driving careers so far .
I would normally thank the Commission for a proposal it sends to Parliament , but this time I am not so grateful .
We actually intended to request a separate vote yesterday , but that all fell through .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
Changes to rest requirements and driving times will severely reduce the ability of schools and coach companies to offer trips abroad at an economically viable rate .
The Member States are not homogenous . They range from federal states to centralised unitary states .
We want Cyprus to join the European Union as a united country . We want it to overcome and resolve its political problem .
The Lisbon objectives are still within our reach , but if we do not display much greater political will from this moment onwards there is no firm guarantee that we will succeed .
All they need is access to the airport , but work is being done on that .
France and the United Kingdom have a right of veto which would prevent this intervention .
Mr President , resolution 1441 firstly calls for effective weapons inspections in Iraq , and secondly for the discussion of the weapons inspector &apos;s report in the Security Council at the end of January , and only thereafter for any new steps to be taken .
There is a great difference between what we are currently giving to these poorest of poor countries and what we gave to the countries that are about to join us , so these instruments need to be adapted .
I agree with my honourable friend Mr Poettering that nuclear weapons cannot be left in irresponsible hands .
On that basis , and as part of this plan of action , the Commission has made EUR 30 million available for emergency support for the peace process by reallocating funds from earlier European Development Funds to support short @-@ term work on the peace process .
I should like to thank Mr Cushnahan for raising this issue in the House today .
how to produce more entrepreneurs ,
UNMIC has set clear benchmarks concerning democratic and market economic reforms , human and minority rights , which are all necessary to prepare Kosovo for future challenges .
If we were to take that as the model , we would be talking about committing 30 per cent of the budget for Chapter B7 @-@ 7 .
Secondly , free , transparent competition .
I have been told by practitioners and specialists in these fields that there is at present no system capable of bringing together even only two jurisdictions , which means that such a system could not be made to work throughout the EU .
What I am about to say may sound like a provocation , but I cannot avoid talking to you about another serious problem which concerns citizens from every European country , that is the 500 000 job cuts in the engineering industry over the next four or five years , a figure I have been given by an international trade union source .
Life @-@ long learning , communication between the generations , voluntary work and similar issues on which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has done a lot of work are intrinsically related to this discussion .
I am one of those people who believe that the dignity of a society is basically measured by the dignity with which it treats its elderly people ; I also believe that issues relating to health , rather than being commercial goods , are a matter of rights .
This will inevitably make demands on public finance , which plays a key part in expenditure on health in all the Member States .
By early December , EUR 755 million of the total European Union commitment of over EUR 830 million had actually been disbursed .
I therefore very strongly support the view of the Greek Presidency and of Commissioner Patten .
In Kabul , non @-@ governmental organisations are falling over each other in their efforts to get projects going in that city , the reason being that other locations are too dangerous , and so aid soon becomes concentrated on projects that do not help rebuild the country as a whole .
In addition , all the countries bordering on Afghanistan need to cooperate in preventing the Al @-@ Qaida network from regaining strength in the area .
One year after the Bonn Conference , it is an opportune time to reflect on the EU &apos;s contribution in restoring peace , stability and credible political structures .
There are no quick fixes in Afghanistan .
It was literally at the eleventh hour that we achieved the result that all desired .
I can fully understand the animal protection organisations &apos; concern about the fact that it will take such a long time for the ban to be introduced and about the fact that so very many thousands of animals will be destroyed for the sake of our vanity .
That attests to the inadequacy of the American cosmetics industry .
. ( FR ) This seventh amendment to Directive 76 / 768 / EEC on cosmetic products is essential because , apart from the fact that it seeks to approximate the various laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products , its main objective is to put in place a lasting and definitive ban on the performance of animal experiments for finished cosmetic products in the European Union .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
In fact , it is clear that this is where the weakness of the borders lies , and the first months following the entry of these States , in law and in fact , into the European Union , is when there will be the greatest danger of a violation of the new external borders of Europe .
Hence the desire to create a common European infrastructure and the proposals to follow the American example , exerting pressure on the Commission to study a similar approach for the European Union , also calling on the Member States , in the forthcoming revision of Directive 93 / 22 / EEC , on investment services , to give investment companies from other States the right of access to national clearing and settlement systems .
As Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs , as Mr Diamandouros &apos;s colleague at the University of Athens and as a long @-@ standing friend , may I say that I am delighted and excited by his election to this post .
When Prime Minister Hariri was elected to office in September 2000 , he set his government an ambitious deadline - to conclude the negotiations with the European Commission by the end of 2001 .
Lebanon exists in the mind of the Lebanese , but many would like to see a stronger affirmation of their State , which would take place in particular through a truly independent , democratic State , in order to establish and develop coexistence between the Lebanese .
With the tensions that we have in the Middle East at the moment , it is essential for us to maintain those links , especially for the Commissioner who , no doubt , has fallen in love with the Lebanon in the same way as many of us have , and for the Commissioner to be able to use the Lebanon as a bridge through which he can talk to sensible , democratically @-@ minded people in the other countries of the Middle East .
Our objective is to have a consolidated draft of the Action Plan ( which will replace the current one on 1 January next year ) tabled by the middle of this year at the latest .
When the political parties were discussing the joint resolution - and it was a very amicable debate - we noted with satisfaction that the Barents Euro @-@ Arctic Council in Kirkenes last week seems to have reached some sort of agreement whereby Russia will sign the MNEPR Agreement you mentioned , and that is a prerequisite for cooperation on nuclear safety to commence in earnest .
I want to thank Denmark for having been so active in this area , and I shall put Greece on the same scales that we used to weigh Denmark &apos;s efforts , with the praise that resulted .
Would it not be appropriate to bring forward the date of entry into force and to implement the directives immediately in order to avoid another major disaster ?
It is the way in which our seas are used , for example for illegal immigration , organised crime , human trafficking , and indeed the abuse of our fisheries law .
The Council decided in the first half of 2002 that the European Police Academy would be set up in Denmark temporarily , pending a decision on its final seat .
Mr Simitis also said yesterday that it is irrelevant that the European Union has four members , the Security Council will decide .
The family , the role of community groups and volunteers who can provide support services and the introduction of a respite care grant for dependent older persons must form part of this health strategy .
We are implementing it , I must stress , in particular thanks to the support of our shareholders and of the European Union , who play a most essential role .
The way in which it is organised must therefore be continually monitored , and unnecessary and costly bureaucracy prevented .
It is a nuclear power station I have visited quite a few times , and safety is so poor there that , following these visits , I am glad that I shall not be having any more children .
It certainly presents an accurate account of the challenges currently facing European aquaculture . The report is also consistent with guidelines contained in the communication from the Commission adopted last September .
Self @-@ help is better .
Mr President , a very important aspect of the common fisheries policy is the communication from the Commission on a strategy for the sustainable development of European aquaculture of September 2002 .
Later on , particularly in the nineteenth century , some countries developed beds of oysters , which were considered - quite rightly - to be a species of food for the refined palate .
That is the oral amendment .
The underlying reason may be that the funds allocated to these activities by the European Commission are insufficient .
We hope that the House will support them and that such issues will be given much fuller consideration in the debate on the recent Commission communication on fisheries agreements with third countries .
In September 2002 in the Canary Islands , and so within the EU area , whale deaths occurred on a scale hardly seen for 20 years , when 15 whales of different species died from haematomas .
Madam President , various breaches of human rights in North Korea have been mentioned here , breaches which offend our moral sense and our concept of civilisation .
As a rule , such measures impact not on the dictators , but - if they have any impact at all - on the people of this already benighted country .
I would like to send this message to our Russian friends .
What is equally serious is the lack of a clear will on the part of the authorities to deal with these violations .
The second important point is Iraq &apos;s responsibility to cooperate actively with the inspectors .
( Applause )
And , Mr President , please allow me to refer to an important aspect of the issue on which I would like to hear more clarifications from the representative of the Council and the Vice @-@ President of the Commission .
Nobody !
Ladies and gentlemen , it must also be clear in this context - if we are honest with ourselves - that if we are to get our voice heard everywhere , be it in New York , Washington , or Baghdad , it will only be by attempting to work out a common position based on the knowledge that this is the only way .
I do not , however , believe for one moment that a war is the correct solution to the problem .
Hundreds of thousands , yes , but not the four and a half million that are in the region .
As I believe , together with the majority of my fellow Members , in the importance of this joint resolution , which must show the world that , at least within the European Parliament , the voices of Europe are in harmony , I sincerely hope that , taking account of the amendments we are proposing , this resolution will be able to win over the votes of as broad a majority as possible .
The US Government , taking advantage of the terrorist acts of 11 September , is now imposing State terrorism on the entire world with the aim of establishing its economic and military domination everywhere .
The photograph was taken at a time when Mr Rumsfeld was President Reagan &apos;s special envoy for relations with the Middle East .
If that were the case , the USA , the UN and the EU would be involved in many wars all over the world : for example , in Saudi Arabia and Israel , to name but a few .
In any event , for my part , I will always be prepared to appear before this Parliament , however many Members are in attendance , in order to try to move forward and overcome the difficulties facing all of us at this historic moment for good or for bad .
The international community must close ranks against this rogue state and stop it becoming a nuclear proliferator if it is not one already , not only because of the threat posed to the South and the 37 000 US troops stationed there , but also the 40 million civilian South Korean population .
Ladies and gentlemen , before detailing the preparations we are making for the meeting in Geneva , I should like briefly to recount the results of last year &apos;s meeting , to give you an idea of the challenges facing us in March and April .
Of course , there were regrets about the lack of cohesion last year between the EU Member States and the so @-@ called Western Group and we have better hopes for this year .
In the Middle East , I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism , especially suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian extremists .
Such problems can only be tackled through sound political institutions , once implementation of the agreement is under way .
Is it not deeply offensive that one European Union government has invited Mugabe to a summit conference in Paris ?
Commissioner Barnier has already made several statements along these lines .
What experience have we had since 1996 ?
It is crucial that the management systems of the applicant countries are defined and integrated , promoting and developing both the delegation of powers to the Sapard agencies , and shortening the chain for implementing aid instruments .
It is also good that public participation is to increase in the most important areas of all , that the public right of access to information about the reasons for granting or refusing a permit is being endorsed , and , once again , that authorities will be required to provide correct , clear and explicit information .
In the short and medium term it is necessary to focus on food safety and food sovereignty , crucial to alleviating present @-@ day hunger .
Developing countries that are in crisis are a good reason to call for more attention to be paid to the food shortage and its relationship with trade .
If we talk about people being hungry , we have to see that 80 % of the hungry live in rural areas .
It is not just about huge amounts of development money ; the aid needs to be sustainable .
I would start by saying that I find it both important and remarkable that across party lines everybody is basically in agreement in describing the problem and in pointing out what needs to be done .
I myself was recently in Kenya and saw how badly just one poor country had been hit by these problems .
By producing products locally , they will be contributing directly to combating poverty , increasing knowledge and fighting disease more efficiently , as the products will already be with the potential customers .
It is not intended to have a formalised character , but to remain an informal matter .
HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis require a global and coherent response , which will cost considerably more than the financial and human resources available to most developing countries .
. ( FR ) We cannot vote for such a falsely pacifist and humanist resolution , whose only goal is to clear the consciences of MEPs while justifying in advance the warmongering machinations of Mr Bush and the imperialistic accomplices who will follow his lead .
Despite several fair proposals , such as cancelling the debts of the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , which I fully support , I cannot vote in favour of this resolution .
I can do something about that now in making it clear that I have made no statement about the views of Dr Blix or about sending a delegation with regard to this Parliament .
That is the end of the matter as far as I am concerned .
This must of course be exercised on a completely voluntary basis and from the bottom up .
It therefore represents hope . We still need to be equal to the questions raised by this movement in relation to the European Union .
It would be preferable not to have two opposing fora - one economic and one social , one governmental and one civil - each calling for completely different political orientations for the future .
Mr President , this evening we will identify what are probably the two make @-@ or @-@ break issues for the next WTO round in Cancun - TRIPS and public health and agriculture .
There are no restrictions , and no external prior approval is needed .
The compromise proposal , which is more humane that the US approach , should allay US concerns that patent laws could be breached and weakened .
It must be made quite clear that obviously , this twin proposal can only be implemented if the other parties involved also restrict comparable export subsidies .
Care must be taken to give absolute priority to the right to produce basic foodstuffs , the right of countries to alleviate their own people &apos;s hunger , the right to cultivate the land and to treat the environment properly , along with the right to pass farms on to the next generation , thus maintaining rural farming , as well as the dismantling of destructive trade mechanisms , and of what we call world trade , which amounted to nothing more than export dumping . This will enable us to develop in solidarity with people in the developing world , as well as with rural farming in Europe .
We are particularly dependent on the continuation of an EU system of export subsidies in order to remain competitive on export markets .
Commissioner , I am concerned , however , that the model of agricultural multifunctionality may be jeopardised .
We should , if possible , debate the negotiation program as a whole , and not bit by bit disjointedly as we have this evening . Mr Franz Fischler and I are certainly willing to do so .
Citizenship of the Union - institutionalised and created as such by the Treaty of Maastricht and later modified by the Treaty of Amsterdam - confers a series of rights and duties on the nationals of all the Member States .
As we are all too aware , we live in a dangerous world .
The recognition for the purpose of residence of unmarried partners on the basis of the legislation of Member States of origin could pose problems to those Member States whose family legislation does not recognise these possibilities .
Or , to put the question another way , are there schools in Portugal in which half the children do not understand Portuguese ?
Mr President , in order to achieve legislation in the field of immigration at Community level we should pay particular attention to the positive effects of immigration , something we are debating here today .
In addition , we propose to submit a report to the Council and the European Parliament on the implications of reciprocity as regards visas .
Only after the 19 November 2002 decision of 14 EU Member States to impose a visa ban on President Lukashenko and seven other leading personalities in Belarus was a compromise finally reached to establish a new OSCE Minsk office as of 1 January 2003 .
Honestly , but with compassion for a population that is rapidly becoming impoverished , Mr Marset Campos points to numerous violations of elementary fundamental rights .
My report also edits the text so that it is gender neutral , in recognition of the fact that many women have entered the seafaring profession over recent years .
Finally , we do not accept the provision in Article 26 ( 2 ) which would prevent Member States from expelling permanent residents in exceptional circumstances .
Belarus has cut itself off from the international community because of the autocratic policy followed by its regime .
We are glad that the report contains explicit references to the protection of human rights and specifically mentions the rights of indigenous minorities .
This sector is the main supplier of seafood products to the domestic fresh fish market .
They were an instrument .
That has to be weighed in the balance .
That would also raise problems .
With effect from their accession , starting in May 2004 , the new Member States will be able to participate in all the support programmes funded by the European Budget .
I would , though , again like to point out that the Commission is proposing that category 7 be left unchanged and that adjustments be made to the financial programme for categories 1 and 2 , covering agriculture , the Structural Funds , internal policies and administration to take account of enlargement .
I am extremely keen , as we review our programmes for the future , to take on board the exceptionally important report which was recently produced by the UNDP .
Mr President , Mrs Kinnock &apos;s question concerns the progress of our negotiations with the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries on economic partnership agreements .
It will improve the social acceptance of temporary agency work and will make it more attractive .
Firstly , it would allow older people to work and still use their skills .
That is why we need a radical rethink , above all on freight transport , where we need a move to rail and waterways .
This contradictory approach makes it entirely possible to ignore the concept so dear to the Commission of sensitive regions in the very sensitive area of the Pyrenees .
If you take a look at what we have achieved with the Essen projects , which we agreed together in 1996 , you will see that not even all 14 projects have been implemented , and we do not have enough money for them .
If I may finally say , this proposal was a complete waste of an opportunity by the Commission to come up with far @-@ reaching , innovative ideas which many of us may have been able to support .
I am not sure that the White Paper , which , in particular , addresses this matter from the point of view of introducing more flexibility into the Community framework on aid for regional purposes in the field of transport services , in particular where links with the peripheral regions and the small islands are concerned , has fully appreciated the importance of this crucial matter for the European peoples concerned .
We all know that the so @-@ called 3G sector , third generation mobile communication , is in serious difficulty and that we have seldom been in a position to transfer so much money from the private sector to the public sector .
Perhaps there would be a need too for funds to be established in the Member States to help socially excluded groups to become integrated into the networked society .
I fully share the opinion of Mr Van Velzen that the operators should work together to create a marketplace .
Even then though we must ensure a level playing field .
When we look at the overall context of this new vista of the knowledge economy and at the opportunities it presents , there are opportunities , but the risk that we run is , because of the huge amounts of money required in investment and infrastructure , unless governments and other agencies are involved , along with private financing , then peripheral and rural areas will lose out on access to these opportunities .
Community legislation on transparency and accessibility of public information already provides a highly comprehensive framework , but in some sectors , a few clarifications should be made in order to prevent any distortion of competition caused by a possible legislative void .
Unless we take these practical steps , we will not be able to make up for the lost time we regret .
My group would emphasise in particular the importance of completing the financial services action plan , fostering entrepreneurship and promoting flexibility and adaptability in the labour market .
It was directly linked to the costs of extra pay for the temporary workers and , moreover , the costs of the extra red tape involved in employing temporary workers .
Let us have an end to the laundry list economic summit !
If anything , they will make it worse .
This letter is commendably realistic because it puts the emphasis where it is needed : on industry which , apart from the fact that it generates 25 % of total European domestic product , also employs 45 million people ; at a time when there is a great deal of talk about services , knowledge and so on , it is worth remembering that the economy has a far more material and palpable basis .
However , a number of questions need answering , Mr President .
Yesterday , in the course of the debate , the arguments put forward by Mr Mayol i Raynal and Mrs McKenna persuaded me not to endorse the report by Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra in the end .
We in the Moderate delegation to the European Parliament are well disposed towards the Commission &apos;s proposal , which is a step towards a common EU immigration policy .
Why do we not spend Europe &apos;s money on better research so that , at last , all motorists have fog glasses ?
We need strong action and strong recommendations from the Commission in this area .
Many scenarios are still possible - including the likelihood of a military attack .
In this context , the inspection chiefs have noted that it is a positive step that Iraq has agreed to allow surveillance flights and is cooperating .
The contact that we had there , both with the authorities of the UN agency and with the NGO officials , have led us unanimously to conclude that after two wars and the current embargo the Iraqi population is at the end of its tether .
We are quarrelling with each other .
These people are a threat to world security .
We must be clear that the villain of this piece is Saddam Hussein - full stop !
I should like to thank the groups and speakers who supported the Greek Presidency &apos;s initiative to convene the Council next Monday .
As far as the timing is concerned , the Council has every intention of keeping to the deadlines , where possible , given the complexity of this subject and the fact that events have undoubtedly altered the general perception of the political and legislative environment .
I do not understand .
That is something I can only endorse .
I was also particularly interested in the honourable Members &apos; comments that measures must be taken to guard borders at European level .
Otherwise , we shall end up in a world in which only the strong make the decisions , in which only the strong can do as they see fit and in which weak countries are entirely subject to the diktat of a stronger power .
I was involved in the research that led to the development of these weapons , in the Terrestrial Weapons Technical Directorate , where we have very powerful unions which protect our workers and our engineers .
This issue , as I indicated earlier , has been considered not just by the Commission , and not just by the Council of Ministers , but also by Parliament .
They are essential to us , amongst other things in order to prevent climate change .
Were it to be deemed under the policy that the biodiversity on a particular piece of land or in a particular area was so important that it needed to be conserved for the future - certain islands were mentioned just recently in this context - who would then compensate whoever was forfeiting his or her asset ?
It has been implied that this regulation could leave the door open to use abortion as a means of contraception or even birth control .
This debate , and I would like to thank our rapporteur for her work on the subject , has to remain serious .
Moreover , we cannot reduce issues involving women &apos;s rights merely to those issues involving reproduction and sexuality .
Therefore , within the framework of the fight against poverty , it is very important that the Community commit itself to carrying out actions in the field of sexual and reproductive health in line with the proposals of the Sandbæk report , because these actions are instruments intended to drastically reduce maternal and child mortality and to prevent , as a consequence , the resort to abortion , since they are also instruments intended to protect the right to life and health .
I hope that we will be able to stay on track on this issue .
However , we reject the Commission &apos;s claim that the Council and Parliament are equally to blame for this failure .
Personally speaking , I regret that but it is what it is .
This should also encourage users to be more careful when taking drugs and adopt a healthier lifestyle .
Advice , the provision of information and prevention naturally remain key , but I nevertheless think that it is also extremely important for the government to try to make nightlife a little safer .
This is our position and we will therefore vote against the Malliori report , for it contains nothing new and just stresses the severity of the problems without proposing any solution , in some cases even changing the approach for the worse .
I would like to see the 18 @-@ year age limit applied - apart from where there is medical need - in order to protect young women from making ill @-@ informed beauty choices .
If we want to optimise quality assurance then this is the second step , now that we have already taken the first step , together with the Commission , of putting in place stricter product safety standards .
Thousands of women who have had problems have contacted the European Parliament and want us to express an opinion on the dangers associated with silicone breast implants .
Furthermore , the rapporteur even claims that the use of safeguard clauses by Member States is likely to damage the uniformity of Community legislation .
The Netherlands has been treated as a pariah for years , but now we are being praised for the way we are dealing with these matters .
Nowadays the European steel industry is very competitive .
Employees should have new rights in companies at all levels .
The fact that this can happen , without even inciting a reaction from the political authorities aside from a few hypocritical groans , shows the extent to which the workers are unable to count on the authorities to defend them .
B5 @-@ 0143 / 2003 , by Mr Maat and others , on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group , on human rights in Kazakhstan and Central Asia ;
The Commission notes that Parliament &apos;s resolution focuses on Kazakhstan only .
The various different political forces need to be brought together around one table , because only by strengthening the rule of law , only by strengthening the institutions , but also only by strengthening pluralism in this troubled country will we once again be able to avoid a serious crisis there , and the lasting damage that this would do to that country and the region as a whole .
How in God &apos;s name can we get out of this ambiguous situation ?
We did so in view of the fact that Parliament had included important wordings concerning the principle of subsidiarity and the importance of the Member States &apos; participating in the work on developing this regulation .
It should be pointed out that the aim of the proposal for a directive they are criticising is none other than to reduce salaries and , therefore , to authorise the recruitment of staff from outside the docks to do the work instead of them .
Not a single piece of incriminating evidence has been produced on the content of the newspaper , since it is a pluralist , objective and democratic publication .
Entirely naturally , we are therefore sticking to our mandate and are not proposing any commitments in the field of audiovisual services in these negotiations .
That is my first question .
Rather than providing elucidation about the various demands or the degree of willingness to deregulate , the documents available tend to be more of a playground for those who interpret these things .
It is for that reason that I appeal to you , Commissioner Lamy , not to abandon the opt @-@ out clause for public provision of services of general interest under any circumstances .
To my knowledge , the coordinators have had this information at their disposal for almost three weeks . Nobody , however , has approached me to say that the detailed proposals do not correspond with what I had previously announced .
That is something that the Member States should regulate for themselves .
We must therefore know who is working in our ports and under what conditions .
We are opposed to it for three main reasons .
I would like to make a couple of observations regarding the content of the proposal . In my opinion , the duration of authorisations is too long , and the end result with regard to the matter of self @-@ handling will be no more than a small step forward .
Here we are talking about also introducing competition into port services in large ports .
The Commission can accept all the amendments proposed , although I would like to comment on Amendment No 2 a little later .
It is not sufficient to say that 12 % of our energy must be renewable . We must take measures so that that becomes the case .
If we want our game plan to give us every chance of success , it is therefore vital quickly to define a framework in which it will be possible to collate local experience and scientific expertise on a permanent basis and not confine ourselves to banning fishing and keeping vessels in port , as if such measures alone were automatically going to result in restocking .
It is time we had an in @-@ depth , honest , completely transparent debate on the type of Europe we want to build together .
When we envisage a post @-@ 2006 Union with 500 million people or more , how will it be possible to run a Union with fewer Commissioners than we have today ?
The economic crisis and the recession are worsening rapidly , unemployment is increasing everywhere with thousands of people the victims of harsh redundancies , insecurity in all its forms is flourishing to the detriment of the weakest and , in the face of these mortal challenges , the first two of which were raised by President Prodi this morning , the written communication discusses new forms of governance , stability , new social and economic agendas , quality of life , border security and even traffic and registration taxes for private vehicles .
We shall have to look at whether this heading will have to be renamed and whether we shall have to divide it up into different sub @-@ headings , et cetera .
Turning to a more contentious issue , as the rapporteur mentioned , the 2004 budgetary period will be unusual throughout .
The answer is none , so why should that succeed now ?
Madam President , when analysing what you , President Prodi , called the state of the Union and the related budgetary guidelines , we must take care , as you also said , to avoid two pitfalls .
Reforming the Commission has been a priority right from the beginning and , starting in 2004 , we will have completely new Staff Regulations .
I should like to point out to Mr Wynn that even as disparate a group as the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats only intends to table a single amendment .
Nor does what we call the British rebate have any rationale behind it any more , Madam President , Commissioner , Mr Wynn , and , wearing only my one hat - in my capacity as rapporteur for the PSE on own resources - I can tell you that , in that area too , the British rebate makes no sense any longer , any more than does its being funded in different ways by the other Member States .
Report ( A5 @-@ 0039 / 2003 ) by Jan Mulder , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , on the guidelines for the 2004 budgetary procedure ( 2003 / 2001 ( BUD ) ) Section III - Commission
In order to combat liberalisation , we must promote a public port service that is coordinated at European level and guarantees the highest possible levels of safety and social standards .
Although the subsidiarity principle has been adhered to , the continual expansion of the European employment strategy , from horizontal objectives to the Four Pillars , has led to constant reductions in its effectiveness .
In our opinion , however , that also means that the economic guidelines must take more account of the ambitions with regard to employment , the fight against poverty , the future of pensions , and health care .
Moreover , Mr Mann calls for implementation of the national further training plans to be pushed through .
The proposal we are debating today encompasses three main objectives . These are to increase the rate of employment , to improve job quality and to open up the labour market to the most disadvantaged groups in society .
For this reason - and let me cite the relevant passage in English to conclude my brief speech - we are asking for &apos; calls for proposals to be made by the Convention in view of its adoption &apos; .
President Duisenberg claims that governors do not vote according to their national interests , that there are , in fact , no votes and that monetary policy is decided by consensus .
What we are concerned with at present , however , is the enabling clause established at Nice .
There is no exclusion any more . There are Member countries , but countries which have a relationship of increasing active cooperation with the countries around them , with the ring of friends .
Membership of the Union means sharing specific political objectives too , sharing roots and identities , sharing much more than just democratic sentiments .
I will ask the Commission to answer these questions in writing given the extraordinary circumstances , but there will be no oral reply .
In its pre @-@ accession instruments the Commission addressed the needs of the Roma minorities in a big way .
I can only ask you , in your capacity as a Member of the European Parliament , to make the facts known for example in Spain and to keep farmers informed .
EMU has been very successful .
In our Commission Communication to the Council we do not intend to modify the pact or to make it more flexible .
As for the calls for economic government , they bring to mind a scene from the film Shoulder Arms . In it a military unit is engulfed in fog , everyone is stumbling around and a soldier is heard calling for his captain .
Swedish industry traditionally asserts that the euro community is at all events good for trade .
I wish to congratulate him on this work , even though I do not share his conclusions , for he has not only succeeded in responding to the Commission &apos;s Convergence Report on Sweden , but has also taken the opportunity of making a contribution to the EMU debate in Sweden before the referendum in September .
It is essential that the Member States accept and reiterate their commitment to complying with the Stability Pact and that that commitment is not simply formal , but that it is made reality .
Funded occupational retirement schemes in the EU cover 25 % of the EU workforce and are currently valued at more than EUR 2 500 billion .
I believe that with its announcement the Commission has acted correctly , that is by examining the extent to which the present taxes are not discriminatory .
That includes provisions on biometric risks , but that should not be an obstacle to cross @-@ border activity .
Naturally we are in constant contact with the United States as regards our position on the Iraqi question .
Let us further suppose that all the worries expressed about the consequences in terms of the stability of the country prove unfounded .
We therefore need , and this is a very basic equation that all Heads of Government could understand ?
The Iranians are the only people who , at the present time , are rising up against their totalitarian regime . They are the only people who are staging massive demonstrations , who are voting in favour of democracy .
We need to tell our American friends that their perception leads to trouble , trouble which is not even in America &apos;s interest .
Simply saying &apos; never again &apos; will not get us anywhere .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Throngs of people throughout the world have gone onto the streets to demonstrate in favour of a peaceful solution to the Iraq dispute .
Personally , I am convinced of the need for regime change , ideally via Saddam &apos;s exile or , failing that , by military intervention , as the only way to ensure a disarmed and peaceful Iraq .
Are there specific targets which would allow us to assess whether Saddam Hussein has taken the strategic decision to disarm at the insistence of the Americans and the British ?
That means we also want Turkey &apos;s help to ensure that the Turkish Cypriots do not remain excluded from this big family , this community of values .
Institutions for occupational retirement provision cannot be treated as mere financial instruments - they should be thought of as a form of social protection .
( Abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
. ( PT ) I acknowledge the importance and the timeliness of this own @-@ initiative report by the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs , both because of the troubled current geopolitical context ( which requires a clarification of objectives and of the direction to take ) , and because of the debate that needs to be launched on vital issues such as the low levels of public and private investment , low productivity growth , the trend of falling rates of employment and the ageing of the population .
Even if the European Union operation will only be of limited size , let me state clearly that I do not consider that this has ever been a useful criterion against which to evaluate its worth .
Of course it is only a limited military presence , but the fact that the EU is now able to use the whole range of options is a symbolic big step forward which - once again , in the shadow of the present debates about Iraq - we are in danger of forfeiting at our peril .
Having created an unnecessary and artificial military divide , the EU and NATO have had to spend two years on negotiating and arrangements to enable the European Union and NATO to find a way of working together .
The Commission very much welcomes the opportunity to address Parliament on this matter .
The only point of contention is the amendment calling for the Commission to secure suspension of the US demands until there is a decision on compatibility with the Data Protection Directive , which means an Article 25 ( 6 ) decision . The PPE @-@ DE Group has not signed this amendment , and I understand they believe it would leave the airlines exposed .
In my opinion this has not been satisfied either .
Consequently , airlines face a real risk of being taken to court , as a result of complaints from passengers whose personal details have been forwarded to the US authorities .
Mr Santini and Mr Jarzembowski referred to this aspect of the case .
In these circumstances , how can we trust the American criminal justice and law enforcement system ?
It would be an easy way out and we would adopt it immediately if that was the only way of ensuring our countries and coastlines were protected ; but neighbouring countries need to do likewise .
But you have raised an important issue which will no doubt engage both the Council and the European Parliament for a long time to come .
The debate has moved back into the home .
Appropriate financial and human resources are of course essential , but what is needed above all is a genuine policy of promoting equality and considerable political will , not only on the part of the bodies responsible in this Parliament but also on the part of the Commission and the Council , to ensure that the gender perspective is genuinely present in all policies and practices .
It can now be seen that , with the transition to a market economy , unemployment has hit women hard , and unemployment is something women will often associate with accession to the EU .
In practical terms this dealt with two resolutions establishing actions , principally the freezing of funds and other economic resources , applicable to the persons and bodies included on the list created by the United Nations Sanctions Committee specifically for this purpose .
I can tell you now that it was not Parliament that uncovered these irregularities but the Commission , which has known since 1999 at the latest that things were not right with Eurostat , and you have simply stood by and done nothing for years .
He is renowned for his thoroughness and persistence , which have so often been the hallmark of the Committee on Budgetary Control in the past and which in fact led to OLAF being set up in the first place .
There is an urgent need to establish an organisational framework for cooperation between the national authorities responsible for the application of consumer law .
Section 15 deals with international private law .
The challenge , of course , is to properly coordinate consumer policy and the completion of the internal market .
The Bureau will not allow any type of speech other than a point of order .
The strategy proposed by the Commission lays down these three medium @-@ term objectives , which are to be achieved through a programme implemented immediately and to be subject to periodic checks carried out by the Commission and recorded in documents certifying progress made .
I believe it to be apparent from all the reports and from everything that has been said , that we are a very long way away from our goal of a high standard of consumer protection in our Community , and that this makes it coherent and logical to enquire whether the country @-@ of @-@ origin principle and the principle of mutual recognition should remain applicable in future .
I hope , nevertheless , that this has enabled the rest of the Members to return to their places , because I have a statement to make .
Public control over the ECB should be increased rather than reduced .
The existence of an internal market and within this , various transnational business operators , requires the creation of appropriate mechanisms for protection and transparency .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if I may , I shall fulminate and also express a demand and a regret .
It is unacceptable for an employer or board of executives to be able to decide to make workers redundant simply to increase company profits .
The outbreak of violence which occurred in Phnom Penh is a reaction to a Thai actress &apos;s comments that Angkor Wat should be returned to Thailand .
Every situation is distinct and calls for different measures .
Mr Karamanou , I have given you a lot of speaking time , firstly because I feel it was impolite of the Commissioner not to listen to you while you were putting questions to him - admittedly , the Commissioner does have a written text prepared beforehand , but it is always polite to listen - and , secondly , because the Chairman of the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Equal Opportunities was talking .
I have no doubt that the first , in September 2002 , contributed greatly to the international appeal for mercy that has helped to ensure her safety thus far .
We need to examine the implications of this crisis within the European Union and the international community and the UN and decide how to tackle them .
We must also do all that we can to help Turkey cope with the political pressures generated by recent events , and to help Iraq &apos;s other neighbours , too - from Jordan and Syria to Iran .
But then what ?
That approach may be the only means of avoiding an escalation of terrorism .
Long live the Iraqi nation !
Not only will the weapons conflict cause desolation and ruin in Iraq , it will also affect the social and human condition of hundreds of millions of men and women all over the world .
We might ask ourselves what right we have to ask countries that have experienced decades of dictatorship to abandon their democratic ideals .
If signing up to whatever Richard Pearle has to say is a necessary price to pay to demonstrate that one is a passionate believer in the transatlantic relationship , then you had better put in a call to Brent Scowcroft or to many of the most distinguished figures in previous Republican administrations .
In 2003 , the European Union will have streamlined key policy coordination instruments .
Let me take this opportunity to applaud the positive result of Slovenia &apos;s referendum on accession , which has followed closely on Malta &apos;s .
We will not accept any curtailment of Parliament &apos;s rights as regards the Budget , but nor do we want to delay enlargement ; we want to keep to the timetable .
Last week , and quite openly , Mr Rumsfeld , the Secretary for Defence , ordered that the armed forces in the Gulf region be equipped with CS gas .
Europe &apos;s last chance could indeed be to create a genuinely European defence system .
Whatever we feel about the rights or wrongs of the conflict in Iraq , the most important thing to do now - and I congratulate the Greek Presidency on trying to achieve a consensus on this - is to bring all of Europe together with regard to humanitarian aid , facilitating the rebuilding of Iraq and ensuring that its people have the right tools to make their own decisions .
This is why we must prevent Iraqi , British and American citizens dying .
We heard the President of the Commission say that a European Union peacekeeping force will most probably take over the role of the NATO force in Skopje this week .
The crisis once more makes it painfully clear that we need a European foreign and security policy and ultimately a European defence force so that we can play a role in the next crisis .
When Europe has rediscovered the reasons for its strong unity , it will have to participate directly , under the aegis of the United Nations , in the construction of the new Iraqi democracy , once it has assisted with the humanitarian needs , the result of a conflict which Saddam Hussein could have avoided by accepting his proposed exile , mentioned several times by Mr Pannella .
We must invest as much as possible in a definitive peace process in the Middle East .
Where is the road map ?
How will it look if , because of disputes about the Budget , we vote on 9 April for a deferment and the Hungarians hold their referendum on 12 April ?
When the Copenhagen Summit approved the Accession Treaties for the new Member States it also endorsed the necessary financial framework .
Admittedly the normal budgetary procedure for the Europe of fifteen , in which Parliament has the right of codecision , was not followed .
We are convinced it represents an improvement on the Commission &apos;s proposal and that it will make the already excellent European civil service even more dynamic and efficient .
We cannot accept Amendment No 16 , Amendments Nos 14 , 15 , 26 , 29 , 30 and 75 - for the reason that I mentioned earlier , i.e. that they are unnecessary because of positive developments in Council on these questions ; Amendments Nos 53 , 55 and 76 on contract agents - because , as I said earlier , the Commission supports Amendments Nos 52 and 54 from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market ; Amendment No 32 on the extension of Article 50 to administrator grade 12 - we do not think that would be appropriate ; Amendment No 63 on sexual harassment where the Commission supports the text put by the rapporteurs in Amendment No 17 , and finally Amendment No 64 on the expatriation allowance , for the very direct reason that the Commission retains the view that the allowance for staff who are expatriate workers is objectively justified and indeed objectively necessary .
There is also a broad consensus that the present legislative framework is inadequate and must be supplemented by a Community strategy on the sustainable use of pesticides .
Any such ban would impose severe limitations , especially in viticulture .
Over the years , the European Union has brought into being and implemented many directives and regulations relating to pesticides , some about the marketing of them , others about banning them from being marketed , but also about their use .
Firstly , with regard to the directive on the protection of workers against risks from chemical agents , it is asking for an amendment introducing a limit value for the concentration of dust in the atmosphere .
Unfortunately , it will be a good many years before the chemicals policy comes into force .
This is why this situation must be reviewed as a matter of urgency and why crew members , who are entirely blameless in the matter , should not be sacrificed .
In fact , they make up two thirds of the world &apos;s poor and bear the main burden of poverty .
In addition , existing efforts must not be replaced , but rather stepped up .
We also need a situation where no one makes money from medicines , which are literally a matter of life and death , destined for poor countries .
Enlargement will certainly not improve this situation , as it will further fragment the European judicial area , increase the number of administrative bodies involved in the management of Community funds and accordingly increase the risk of fraud .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has presented certain amendments aimed at taking this clarification further , and I would therefore ask the other groups to support them .
The worst situation we could face would be to increase the entropy of the system , with the various bodies being concerned only with their own competences , without the fight against economic crime on a European scale being pursued more effectively .
The rapporteur &apos;s work is conditional upon this structure and therefore has to respond to the most significant issues in the Green Paper and also glean from that supplementary and premature information the essential notion , which is to achieve the legal basis necessary to continue a careful analysis .
I particularly welcome the fact that up to EUR 600 million will be made available for the fight against these diseases , of which the EU will contribute up to EUR 200 million .
.
Consequently , so little remained that it would be preferable to maintain the position adopted on 30 January , in which the majority of Members of the European Parliament affirmed their commitment to the United Nations &apos; remaining at the centre of the world order and roundly condemned a unilateral war .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
It is always a sensitive time to raise human rights and Kurdish rights in Turkey , but if we do not , we let down Turkey itself and its prospects of getting into the EU .
As regards your suggestion for a date in May , I am glad to see that your group &apos;s president , Mr Poettering , was listening .
The second important point is that there are sudden epidemics of new diseases .
The speed at which the epidemic is spreading proves how important it is for every case to be reported at once , which is why I believe that the European Commission should exhaust every means at its disposal to persuade third countries to inform all the competent agencies at once and cooperate efficiently , regardless of whether or not they have signed a cooperation agreement with the World Health Organisation .
Amendment No 8 intends to authorise an individual to obtain the initial qualification or periodic training in the Member State of their choice .
In that regard , therefore , I am happy with the different training methods proposed by the Council .
Language @-@ learning must , in fact , remain a priority for the European Union .
It has been in existence since the mid @-@ 1980s , and provides educational opportunities for students from within the European Union and the applicant states to study in different Member States .
Promoting cooperation with third countries will also improve still further the quality of university education in Europe .
That is why we have tried something for which I also thank Mr Mauro , namely to make you more aware of this .
We consider that to be a more equal and more balanced allocation of funding .
Mr President , Commissioner , Madam Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control , Helmut , fellow Socialist Members and Members from the other political groups who have worked with us : I believe we can be satisfied with the work we have done to date on the discharge of the budget of 2001 , which enjoyed broad consensus in Cocobu and which failed to win the support only of those who , out of ideological prejudice against the European institutions , consider this exercise to be more a means of checking their growing strength than an instrument for correcting their mistakes .
Significant efforts have been made to see to it that renewable energy will soon be utilised , that provision is made for solar panels and suchlike .
He has again called for reforms to the balance sheet .
The fourth demand would then have to be to avoid abrupt changeovers between programming periods in future .
That is unacceptable .
We have overcome a difficult hurdle .
The most senior official responsible for financial control at the Committee of the Regions issues a cry for help !
What we are looking at is a lack of control with regard to management and implementation , to say nothing of the possibilities for corruption that are permitted and covered up as a result .
I am pleased that my report has been adopted almost unanimously by the House .
Today &apos;s global society requires us continually to improve our preparation for the challenges that face us .
These are very important issues and I am only sorry that Mr Staes &apos;s report did not receive a larger majority in this House .
In short , there is absolutely no reason to liberalise the sale and use of any narcotic drugs , including cannabis , or to remove cannabis from the list of prohibited substances .
We take the same approach to tobacco addiction .
In this process , new strategies in the fight against drugs or the reinforcement of existing ones will always be welcome .
Mr President , Mrs Malliori recently took the first steps in the European Parliament to open up lines of thought that may lead to the legalisation of drugs .
This family immigration consists of both family reunification in the strict sense - the reunification of family members with a third @-@ country national who is already resident - and the reunification of a family when the family ties are established after the entry of the third @-@ country national .
At the same time , however , I do not consider it wrong for us to link certain requirements to the rules on family reunification .
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur for the work that she has done on this , and I would also like to add my voice to that of Mr Evans and to support all the comments that he made on this report .
They also refer to a very broad range of reforms such as reforms in social security and protection systems , the question of pensions , the question of taxation , especially when it refers to low wages .
I want instead to address a political issue that I believe to be a major issue .
That being said , and to respond to the concerns that have been expressed both by several Members of Parliament and by some of our Member States , as well as by some traders and , obviously , by the countries in question , the Commission has agreed to show a degree of flexibility .
The next issue is to ensure that the different international humanitarian NGOs will be given access without having to obtain clearance from either party in the conflict .
This became apparent once again after the Prestige disaster .
This is a completely different issue .
There is justification for an EU proposal to make that a crime everywhere .
Parliament really must vote in favour of Mrs Cerdeira &apos;s report tomorrow and in so doing clearly express its rejection of a fortress Europe , of the kind that is in the process of being created , and it must also clearly declare its support for the right to live in a family , which is an absolutely essential right in all of our democracies .
The Commission shares Mr Turco &apos;s opinion that it would be difficult for European Union citizens to understand that the classification system of Europol documents should be different from the classification system of European Union documents .
I welcome Commissioner Vitorino &apos;s confirmation , according to which Europol can simply apply that Regulation now , in anticipation of formal rules being drawn up .
If the European Union has to have a common immigration and asylum policy and has to provide itself with the means to manage migratory flows , this policy should respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms that are universally recognised and acknowledged by the Member States .
Top priority issues , such as enlargement , the links between European policies and daily life and the problems of European citizens , especially following the accession of new countries to the European Union , which is expected to bring about considerable changes in European agricultural , budgetary and financial policy , need to be the subject of full , substantiated information .
Another point which I believe to be extremely important , and which I believe must also be revised , and in relation to which this document introduces a very clear request , is the issue of languages .
Mr President , I would like to support you on behalf of the Socialist Group , while pointing out that we have fought bravely with the groups in this House , in the desire to include the right to strike in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and for this Charter to be incorporated into the European Constitution .
Far @-@ reaching , often painful economic reforms were needed in all the countries which were to accede .
This is about what impact the transformation of a society has on its weakest members .
In just a month &apos;s time , when our future fellow MEPs come here as observers , we shall be given an initial foretaste of what this will be like .
On the other hand , we also want to put right an old injustice . These candidate countries , which found themselves on the other side of the Iron Curtain after the Yalta conference , lost both their independence and cultural identity .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , I am able to report to you today on the conclusion of a successful process .
The Accession Treaty still needs to be ratified in parliament .
We call on the Council , as a matter of urgency , to provide Parliament with early information on developments in the accession process and to involve us in good time .
Today , however , we are voting for the future of half a billion people , for a future of peace and peaceful coexistence in tolerance and in diversity .
I consider the Chirac / Schroeder deal on this to be a shabby affair , a clandestine deal in this age of transparency .
I hope that Mr Annan has already accepted this invitation .
( PT ) In an area in which there is complex tension between the efficiency of a centralised European police force , the powers of the Member States , the effective framework of the Treaties and of Community law in force , and the problems of democratic control , the solution of the rapporteurs charged with evaluating the Danish and Greek initiatives on Europol is simply to urge the European Parliament to reject these initiatives and to push the Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs to make a maximum overall draft recommendation .
The terms that we have offered the applicant states are unimaginative and mean .
. ( EL ) I voted against in the case of Poland because I find its overall stand on the issue of war with Iraq unacceptable .
Yet the EU has not done its homework , and the Treaty of Nice is a mockery .
After all , political stability , peace and security create the conditions for all other policy objectives .
I am voting against , but not against the Czech Republic itself . Rather , I am voting against the circumstances in which this enlargement is set to take place , as I made clear in my explanation of vote on the Brok report .
This is an important moment in the history of Cyprus .
( DE ) I have today voted against the application by the Republic of Malta for accession to the European Union .
The Council is of course not obliged to adopt Parliament &apos;s amendments , as Parliament is only to be consulted on this matter . If however the Council concedes in principle that there should be European regulations on family reunification , the Council should realise it is starting down a very slippery slope .
I should like to take this opportunity to underline the fact that the Morillon report notes that action by the two organisations and their members must be directed and governed by the principles of the United Nations Charter .
Prime Minister Simitis said as much recently . Over the last few weeks , the European Convention , chaired by Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing , has not arrived at a decision on the issue nor made its response known .
I will go no further than to express my hope that , in the face of her growing global responsibilities , France will be able to strengthen her own means of defence . This is the only and the best contribution France can make to what remains of Europe .
General Morillon wants the EU to do the same as the United States did in Kosovo or perhaps Iraq or some other small country against which the United States waged a war of aggression in the last hundred years .
What we Europeans need is a European security strategy to be a response to that .
ESDP is not only a threat to NATO - which is a supremely intergovernmental organisation .
A Social Democrat spoke in terms of a colonial Camp David .
I do not believe that the purpose of the EU &apos;s security policy should , in the first place , be to develop strong , joint military power .
I would have been grateful if you could have put this question when we reached the time for your question out of respect for the agenda , not at the time of your pleasing .
What I said about humanitarian assistance in these situations applies precisely to both sides .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , coordination and harmonisation are needed with a view to establishing measures to prevent sexual harassment in the Armed Forces .
Since Question Time at the February part @-@ session was cancelled and the President , on account of point 2 of the Guidelines for the conduct of Question Time , did not place it on the March agenda , I shall repeat the question .
I therefore request the Commission to reconsider its restrained position on this issue .
In particular we support the amendments which seek to exclude from the scope of this directive tissues and cells originating from human embryos or genetic engineering , insofar as there is no European legislation defining the use of gene therapy .
That is very commendable , for the real task here is genuinely to bring together all the social groups - patients &apos; organisations , but also scientists and others - round the table , and he has been at pains to draw the different positions together .
The use of cells that are of sensitive origin from an ethical point of view needs to be specially regulated , if that is not already the case , in the Member States .
The debate is closed .
The Commission &apos;s proposal must take into account the recently adopted legislative provisions in the area of processed products , as regards the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of genetically modified seed in conventional varieties of seed .
I support the Commission &apos;s proposal to create a clear financial basis for this support .
A normally sensible , wise and objective official , widely respected and , indeed , loved by the world of food and food safety allowed herself to be bounced into a statement that the Commission could accept 250 .
It revised its initial proposal of 350 mg / l and supported the proposal of 250 mg / l .
That is why we accompanied our approval in principle with a text citing ten essential requirements for a freer Europe .
Moreover , I agree with the principle that the possibility of introducing legislation on individual products should be provided for , with a view to imposing more stringent requirements in the field of safety , use and environmental protection than those already laid down by horizontal legislation .
My answer is that a much more stringent statement than the one that has now emerged would of course have been desirable .
This remainder must not in any event contain any highly persistent or hormone disrupting substances .
At a conciliation , it was agreed to ban category 1 and category 2 CMR substances in the cosmetics directive when the seventh amendment was made . It can therefore be stated that Parliament &apos;s proposal concerning cosmetic products has been accepted .
Worthwhile projects are under way at present , for example in Colombia , to promote a broader view of the cultivation system .
All the political groupings are aware of the disastrous impact that this fall in coffee prices will have on the economy of a number of the poorest countries in the world .
That is why I have voted against several articles and against the proposal as a whole , because it is dangerous to vote for rules which give the impression that they can be applied , when they cannot .
This contamination is uncontrollable .
It is we politicians who must take responsibility for giving out political messages and political information , something that obviously applies both to choosing the points at issue and setting them out before people .
The report even believes that European military force should be capable by 2009 of carrying out an operation of the level and intensity of the Kosovo conflict within European territory .
During the last months , the Commission has also participated in various EU actions to transmit to the Supreme Court of Justice and the local authorities our preoccupation about the increasing wave of threats , attacks and violence in that country .
The first so @-@ called &apos; traitors &apos; were picked up in mid @-@ March .
It is every bit as real as the Iraq war .
Do we listen ?
But we are encouraged that the ruling NDP party has recently proposed radically to limit the scope of the state of emergency and the system of state security courts associated with it .
Above all , the Kashmiri people should be involved in this process .
This is extremely important in order to ensure that the people of Guinea @-@ Bissau are given the means to find a democratic solution to the appalling crisis affecting their country .
Mr President , I would also like to lend my support to those who have signalled their congratulations to Eryl McNally for doing an excellent job in piloting this through Parliament and of course in conducting negotiations on our behalf with the other institutions .
To that extent , I think , we have been able to improve the Commission proposal by making it more precise , specific and exact , and I hope it will meet with general approval tomorrow .
Still , even for those such as myself who were not able to follow every twist and turn , my group is certainly extremely pleased with the outcome and looks forward to supporting the rapporteur in the vote tomorrow .
Moreover , the process of cogeneration can avoid the emission of carbon dioxide , which means that stepping up the promotion of cogeneration plants is an essential instrument in the package of measures required to comply with the Kyoto protocol on global climate change .
We must acknowledge your work and your will to resolve issues so that the European citizens are much better covered and so that they gain confidence in air transport .
In addition the UK Government has already estimated extra costs to the UK sector of £ 50 million , a fact that the Commission is determined to ignore .
Today , therefore , I would like to go in to bat for a Europe that is more involved in space .
It is the only technology capable of ensuring the emergence of new worldwide rules to genuinely allow the European industry to access new markets and new technological developments .
The first compromises I suggested were based on this .
The purpose of this amendment is to enable the authorities responsible to set out the steps that need to be taken without having to take action themselves or incur costs in advance , which may be considerable and difficult to recover afterwards .
That is one reason why I oppose the introduction of joint and several liability .
In Denmark , we have banned a large proportion of the pesticides on the market in the rest of the EU .
That is the core of the polluter pays principle .
We discussed the Commission proposal on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , and we are proposing numerous necessary amendments to it .
In the light of this , it appears premature to impose fully @-@ fledged financial security for all Annex I operators within a few years .
On this , I completely agree with what Mr de Silva said , to the effect that the environmental agreements can only be supplementary in areas in which they can be used to bring about improvements , or added value , in the environmental sphere , and that they should not just be used to avoid environmental regulation in a particular area .
The aim of our requests for a separate vote is to rule out such a possibility .
Otherwise it would have the right to choose no option whatsoever and to completely ignore the objections made by Parliament , which would be thoroughly undemocratic .
The loss of half the EU &apos;s share of the global market within a mere two years is due to the stand taken by the ? U and the Member States which , instead of supporting and improving this strategic sector , are supporting and multiplying the profits of the monopolies , mainly in Germany and Denmark .
Although it has been identified , we still do not know its exact natural history , just as we still have no special anti @-@ viral medication to treat it and are a long way from finding a vaccine to prevent it .
I think that the European Commission should develop an emergency plan for this kind of situation , a plan which enables us to take concrete action in response to emergencies and then take measures such as those our American and Canadian colleagues are taking : quarantining people suspected of having the infection , providing additional funds for preventing the spread of the virus and support for people who are in voluntary or enforced quarantine .
There are many examples here and health is one of them .
I know some progress has been made in identifying the virus , but what progress has been made in identifying a vaccine for us ?
I believe that our proceedings in this Chamber today are being broadcast live .
Reports and resolutions falling outside this scope should take up less agenda time and staff effort .
The second unusual feature is that support for developing rural areas in the new Member States is substantially higher - disproportionately so - than it is in the EU of 15 .
We had a presentation last year to inform everyone , which we all conveniently forgot , and have had another presentation this year , but now we have the reality of the situation .
In view of disasters of this type and the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on improving safety at sea in response to the Prestige accident ( COM / 2002 / 0681 final ) , when will the Commission present the assessment of whether current legislative and policy instruments for protecting the environment should be adapted in order to minimise the risk of accidents and the damage associated with them occurring ?
A key objective is to focus on the millennium development goals and the targets for access to water and sanitation for the poor .
In the short to medium term , priority is given to funding the measures necessary to support the peace process and national reconciliation , including creating the conditions for free and fair elections .
This process is now being discussed with the ACP partner countries .
It is the case that this programme is now in the hands of the legislative authority , that discussions are ongoing , and I believe it to be a matter of general consensus that the European Union should continue to give support in the health sector .
Then there is the authorities &apos; continuing arbitrary treatment of the Kurds , who , even after formal changes to the law , are far from being treated as having equal rights .
Associations of cooperative societies in Europe have been demanding this sort of statute for some years now , and the text of the regulation now before you has met with their approval .
This period should in fact allow sufficient leeway for the ECJ to hand down a clarificatory ruling .
In adopting them , we shall help to develop cross @-@ border cooperative activities in the social work sector which , according to the more general strategy on employment in Europe , will constitute an important source of employment .
Recreational craft in the European Union account for 0.5 % of all emissions .
Can the European Union remain unprepared to confront and respond to the needs of the industries involved in this activity , simply because there is no legal base that would enable it to intervene effectively ?
The Barcelona process , the comprehensive dialogue , the human rights and on @-@ going political and cooperation negotiations with Iran , the on @-@ going negotiations for a free trade area with the Gulf Cooperation Council , the ministerial meetings and our very tight political links with Turkey - all these constitute a solid basis on which to build an active and constructive EU policy in the wake of the Iraqi conflict .
We Europeans have responsibilities here .
The overriding aim must be to set aside past divisions and focus on what must and can be done to help the Iraqi people at this time .
But we were not aware of the immense irresponsibility of the occupiers .
When we have cholera , when we have dozens dead , when we have the looting of Baghdad museum , when we have the looting of nuclear facilities , we do not pass a decision , we do not pass a resolution , because those who back the war do not want the European Parliament to pass a resolution and stand before European public opinion .
If three quarters of the Members of Parliament were prepared to take up such a clear and , in certain cases , courageous stance on this issue in a roll @-@ call vote last month , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , it is because , thanks to the Iraqi crisis , they understood that it was essential to give their unreserved support to our colleagues currently working in the working groups on defence , chaired by Commissioner Barnier , and on foreign policy , chaired by Mr Dehaene .
Of course , it is exciting to see that , after this war which some people still persist in describing as unnecessary , pamphlets , books and newspapers are being sold on the streets of Baghdad which would have led to a prison sentence and torture under Saddam Hussein - or , elsewhere , under Communism .
I should like , however , to close by commenting that many who speak of the need for a common foreign policy or common security or defence policy consider that what must of necessity emerge from these procedures are decisions or positions which correspond absolutely to their creed and their positions .
It is therefore appropriate to remove this clause .
Mr President , a Bilderberg meeting will open in Versailles tomorrow .
This is why it is appropriate for the European Parliament to be consulted and not merely informed , as you have said .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I am not going to repeat the excellent points made concerning the untenable situation as regards what is known as the third pillar .
However , I repeat that , under the draft extradition agreement , every Member State also has the facility to decide itself which country the person requested will be extradited to .
It goes without saying that the intensity and pace at which relations between the EU and individual countries develop will depend on the capabilities and ambitions of the individual partner states .
We do not want the hallmarks of the European Union to become borders protected by barbed wire and infrared cameras in the east and the south ; we want the EU to be associated with partnership and closer bonds .
Democratisation of society , the rule of law and respect for human rights and minorities need to be implemented by means of practical policies not just because membership of the European Union is on the horizon , but also because they are in the best interests of the peoples concerned .
However , better engagement and cooperation with Belarus in areas of common interest is essential to encourage reform in that country .
I should like therefore to begin with the latter .
Concessions in economic relations and help with military research must be made conditional on significant improvements in the human rights situation in Russia , and on the country &apos;s respect for fundamental rights .
In practice , though , this will not in the least be a problem , as there is no dispute about the borderlines .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Council has asked the Commission to produce a study of the effects of Basle II .
Question No 10 by Gerard Collins , which has been taken over by Mr Andrews ( H @-@ 0238 / 03 ) :
As the time allocated to Question Time is at an end , Questions Nos. 39 to 58 will be answered in writing .
Naturally the legislation permits us to sell our products on the European market under certain conditions but as regards the supermarket chains we are left with question marks .
As far as FMD is concerned , all is quiet in the candidate countries , but I would like to take this opportunity to observe that this state of affairs can change rapidly .
The Commission has moved , in large measure , to implement what we in the temporary committee recommended .
I should like to thank Mr Sturdy , Mr Parish and my UK colleagues who were at the forefront in promoting the original establishment of the temporary committee , for reasons that will be obvious .
Mr President , Mrs Ferrer &apos;s report provides very interesting ideas for developing the concept of capacity building and to describe the means to implement it .
After all , it is not we who develop a country ; it develops itself .
Mr President , I do not think anyone in this Chamber tonight would disagree with the concerns about the education crisis in our world : 115 million children worldwide do not attend school and two in five children in Africa receive no education whatsoever .
Therefore they are excluded from the system .
What would help them is something to which they do , in fact , have every right - to have a share in the added value of successful productions - whether this be through the practice of buy @-@ outs , through appropriate remuneration , or by way of the options that are open to us in the European Union .
We just need to know how things stand . We would like the Commission to report on this promptly .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party supports Mr García @-@ Margallo y Marfil &apos;s report .
Last year , we already saw a decline in economic growth .
&apos;In particular , Member States should over the coming three years design , introduce and effectively implement reforms of pension systems , encourage longer working lives by modifying incentives that encourage early withdrawal from the labour market and by restricting access to early retirement schemes , increase funding and improve , where necessary , access to supplementary pension schemes &apos; .

Wages are always set in relation to productivity .
I know that many MEPs , both in my own and also in other groups , would like to see governors from the financial and commercial worlds , and perhaps even from the world of politics , at the heart of the European Central Bank .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.40 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
Unfortunately , Russia , unlike more than 100 States , has not yet kept its promise to ratify the Protocol .
Mr President , I call for your and Parliament &apos;s support so that there is a reaction and this sort of arrogance stops .
If we divide up the public service and want to turn it into a centre of profit , that will mean the end of the public postal service , the end of any postal presence throughout the territory , and the end of the social nature of this sector .
If the European Union , with its resources , with its weight , or as a member of the United Nations , does not take action , what can we expect of the African Union , or what message can we send to it ?
I therefore appeal to the Council of the European Union , to the governments of our Member States , to act resolutely so that Taiwan can join the World Health Organisation at last , and to ensure that these artificial obstacles are overcome .
It is responsible for discrimination against indigenous peoples by the ethnic Vietnamese , the so @-@ called Kinh .
The deadline for tabling amendments to this proposal is tomorrow , Tuesday , at 4.00 p.m .
I will take up the matter , Mrs Maes .
This formula asks for an improvement of the actual implementation of the rule of law , meaning respect for such fundamental freedoms as political association and peaceful assembly , the independence of the judiciary , the right to a fair trial and the exclusion of all forms of torture and ill @-@ treatment .
For example , Amendment No 28 , which I have just mentioned , refers to MEPs &apos; customs privileges , which , as we are living in an internal market , no longer exist .
As far back as 15 years ago , this report stressed that the European Parliament was an institution destined to play a crucial role in the Community &apos;s activity and in the process of producing Community documents , and that there could therefore be no opposition to changes deemed to be necessary for the Community bodies .
The only way to break this impasse is to vote for the report as a whole , to take the process a step forward .
It is only because we will favour and encourage small customers to bundle together in order to form sales communities that small consumers will now be able to get a good price .
The second point for which we have fought hard is of course unbundling : functional unbundling , obligatory as from July 2004 , and legal unbundling , obligatory by 2007 at the latest .
Therefore , I cannot endorse a Parliamentary debate which does not provide a solution but continues to destroy what does exist .
Types of energy choices can be affected , however .
I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their speeches and say that perhaps Mr van Velzen - one of the shadow rapporteurs along with Mr Linkohr and Mr Clegg - summed up best what most speakers have said here , in other words , that we would like more .
We are now talking about 15 year @-@ old vessels , but it is important for a vessel , irrespective of age , to be of a good class and standard and to be well maintained .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to take up some of the issues raised here today .
This is what Mrs Mann a moment ago called deep integration and it is initiatives of this kind that we are in the process of launching , including with South @-@ East Asia in the form of the very recent cross @-@ regional EU @-@ ASEAN initiative launched just over a month ago in Laos , in Luang Prabang .
I hope that the Council and the Commission share this opinion , and therefore provide this good instrument with the corresponding legal basis .
To achieve this , the Technical Assistance Offices have been dismantled and eight delegations have been set up ( in Algeria , Tunisia , Morocco , Egypt , Jordan , Syria , Lebanon and the West Bank ) , with a representation only in Gaza .
The focus on results rather than process means more emphasis on the use of targets and indicators to benchmark progress .
It is also about increasing the value of products and raising the level of productivity .
For my part , I would rather see more respect for the spirit of open coordination - of diversity , of the exchange of good practice - and talk in concrete terms of successful experiments , which should be passed on .
If we take into account the economic climate and the experience we have gained in recent years on the European employment strategy , it would appear that the Commission has already endeavoured in its proposals to define specific objectives which I consider to be particularly important because they are in line with the recommendations made by the Commission on the basis of the evaluation of national employment plans .
It is a question of the demographic challenge which , in Stockholm in March 2001 , was identified as one of the Union &apos;s most important issues for the future .
Accordingly , I shall support the view that signature should be conditional on finding a solution to a problem affecting many European citizens .
These agreements represent the current low point in the development of the EU &apos;s legal policy .
.
There needs to be scope for mobility , for example , to maximise the benefits the Union can gain from hosting these individuals .
Mr President , I would just like to clarify one point with regard to the voting list .
. ( FR ) Lifelong learning , work and the elderly are all highly important subjects that are highlighted in this report , and employment strategies are vital .
One such aspect concerns setting a monthly parliamentary allowance that is the same for all Members , regardless of which country they represent .
As the Mann report again shows , the chief aim of creating regional free trade areas ( FTAs ) is to ensure the EU has political and economic stability in its relations with the countries concerned ( the &apos; strategic geo @-@ political interests &apos; ) so that nothing can get in the way of the sacrosanct free movement of goods , services and capital .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.30 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
There is still room for improvement , it is true .
Another key element of this reform is modulation .
This brings me to the reports on the market regulations , and I would like to start with the Souchet report on cereals and starch .
It does not help to bury one &apos;s head , ostrich @-@ like , in the sand and say that we have not noticed anything and that we do not wish to change anything .
Now as far as modulation is concerned , I should like to assure you that I am taking serious account of the limit proposed by Mr Cunha , which is slightly higher than that proposed by the Commission , but of course this is a matter that will also be discussed at the Council of Ministers for Agriculture .
Mr President , EU agricultural aid discriminates against the developing countries , the acceding EU Member States , the environment and ecological interests .
On other continents , decoupling as an instrument has failed .
Commissioner , I have probably been involved in politics as long as you have , and the basic duty of the institutions is certainly to protect the weakest members of society and yet you have put yourself in the position of protecting only the strongest .
It will not help however if everyone takes their region out and says that nothing should be done here and nothing should be done there .
.
Question No 25 by Ward Beysen ( H @-@ 0315 / 03 ) :
In future , we would like to see our national team participating in official competitions .
However , the measures introduced must be adequate measures to prevent abuse .
Therefore you can expect a new phase with negotiations on this directive .
After 12 years of struggle , the security situation in our country has improved considerably , but it still requires the measures of vigilance and protection made necessary by the isolated acts of violence which occur from time to time .
The proposal also makes it plain that responsibilities must be clearly distributed so that it is the actual exporter who gives notice of the export .
It will bring all the EU countries into compliance with the Cartegena Protocol and enable them to go forward and ratify it .
When we get together to take a measure within the maritime sphere , we can now , as Mr Lange also said , achieve a very great deal internationally .
No wonder more than 230 UK fishermen have applied to scrap their vessels .
The report by Mr Fava on the action plan to counteract the social , economic and regional consequences of the restructuring of this industry in the European Union raises the need for the Community to deal with the losses with sufficient financial resources and without so much uncertainty , particularly in terms of employment , which this reform of the CFP will cause in the regions dependent on fishing .
I will say nothing about the report by Mr Fava since we are all going to accept it and I believe there is little controversy about it .
Mr President , I would like to focus on the Fava report and then make a brief point on this absolutely fascinating debate on the Irish Box .
I am very grateful , Mr President , but I believe the Commissioner should tell us what the truth is : is it what he stated in his answer to Question No 26 - which is that the regulations are in force - or what he has just stated , which is that the regulations are no longer in force ?
Democratisation , reconciliation and regional cooperation , on the one hand , and the rapprochement of each of these countries with the Union , on the other hand , constitute a single entity .
We want a strong Commission , because it , together with Parliament , and of course with the European Court of Justice , forms the heart of the European Community .
I fear that the proposal we adopted yesterday will not make your work any easier , but I hope you will be guided in this , as in other matters on your agenda , by the advice of your philosopher , Socrates : remember that there is nothing stable in human affairs , therefore avoid undue elation in prosperity , or undue depression in adversity .
Parliament is demeaning itself .
I hope that the Union will decide to give consideration to this and that the next Presidency of the Union will put forward proposals in this respect .
Besides , Greece and other Member States did not articulate a single word of criticism of the Anglo @-@ American invasion ; on the contrary , they helped it in any way they could .
First of all , to congratulate the Greek Presidency , which , in a troubled and difficult period for Europe , has achieved a great deal , showing once again that there is no correlation between the size of a country and the quality of its European presidency .
For example , the Military Committee in Brussels is discussing intervention in the Congo .
We are a union which has progressed and realised the need for institutional changes , which sees it needs a stronger presence in the field of foreign policy and defence .
We have sought to be as constructive and positive as possible to assist the conclusion of this difficult matter .
We have precedents for this .
Hence our vote against the report .
I do feel , however , that the European Parliament should not assume the Council &apos;s old stance against the reference to the precautionary principle . The principle is , in any case , covered by Community legislation .
This nationalistic approach in Parliament towards fisheries is extremely hard to accept from an ecological point of view .
We have agreed with Mr Swoboda that we can accept an amendment from the radical and green corner , concerning the willingness of Turkey to fulfil its tasks under the reforms , as an addition , not as a replacement .
I can offer him some words of consolation : even if the official spokesperson of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats does not support his report , the official spokesperson of the Social Democrats is genuinely 99 % behind him .
Finally , a third remark in response to the rapporteur &apos;s proposal .
The other points mentioned were the role of the army , minority rights for the Kurds , the right to vote , in other words the fact that the 10 % hurdle is still in place , the imprisonment of persons motivated by political or moral conviction such as Leyla Zana , who will soon have spent ten years in prison for speaking freely , or the issue of the heritage of the Armenians and Syrians , which is not protected at present in Turkey .
I would venture to say that the countries which intend to share our European culture may become part of the European Union .
In support of the government dialogue both Europe and United States have recently reconfirmed their commitment to the Transatlantic Business Dialogue in a more focused format .
For example , our collective economies are only achieving moderate success at this particular time .
Initially , however , it did not adopt a particularly interventionist line . One section of the administration used the trauma of 11 September to impose its own unilateralist and extremely interventionist agenda which predated those terrible events .
I had the privilege of working with a very proficient core team , efficient departments in Brussels and with an enthusiastic observation team comprising over one hundred members .
Question No 2 by Alexandros Alavanos ( H @-@ 0292 / 03 ) :
Subject : List of terrorist organisations
results of the Convention on the Future of Europe and decisions for the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference ;
However , the Union was present at the meeting held in Crete a few days ago , at the Euro @-@ Mediterranean conference , which was also attended by the Israelis and the Palestinians and numerous other Arab countries .
The problem is that we are being treated like NGOs in this area .
With regard to the question of whether an institutional agreement or an article in a proposed treaty or Constitution is the best place for this , I personally have not made up my mind on that point .
Madam President , Commissioner , I welcome this discussion enormously .
We cannot allow it to be used to interfere in the process of setting salaries and to exert pressure for making the labour market more flexible .
There is your proposal to create a &apos; women and sport &apos; unit .
Just imagine , in 1912 , when the legendary Pierre de Coubertin was asked about the possibility of organising Olympic games for women he replied as follows : &apos; This is impracticable , lacking in interest , anti @-@ aesthetic and incorrect .
Through sport , we can combat drugs and exclusion and give people room to grow and develop , but everyone - girls as well as boys , women as well as men - must have the same opportunities .
Together we have followed a path that we think is the best for everyone who has to face , will have to face or has had to face the problem .
The second point on which I would like to focus concerns item 7 ( g ) of the report in question .
The report gives key importance to quality standards and best practice , which Community health policy can help evaluate and which can be extended throughout all the Member States .
Exceptions to the rules should , however , be limited to flexibility in the attendance of an official inspector and the forwarding of information .
Whatever titles and job descriptions the inspectors may have , they need to be backed by very clear and robust legislation that leaves no one in any doubt as to their authority and rights .
This report will take us in that direction and it is very welcome .
The Commission has made commitments concerning labelling in other legislation .
However , the right to freedom of expression is highly protected .
However , we believe , and I personally believe , that farmers need security .
The Commission proposal does not increase appropriations for rural development . Instead , it transfers some of the appropriations from the &apos; markets &apos; pillar , which will mean some of the CAP &apos;s costs being renationalised .
The June Movement believes that the only real way to abolish discrimination is by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely .
The last of our industries that have not already relocated to the East will move to Turkey , where the cost of labour is even lower than in Eastern Europe .
I , like many others , believe that cancer remains the real &apos; disease of the century &apos; , which must be given priority .
For years the Committee on Petitions has been demanding intensified inter @-@ institutional cooperation .
From my own experience I know how dangerous it is just to travel from one place to another in this territory .
The EU &apos;s extension of its travel ban against the regime , and assets freeze , were agreed in April but suspended until October in the hope of some improvement in the situation .
The economy is in ruins ; exports and tourism , once flourishing sources of income , have collapsed .
I understand the Greens &apos; argument , though .
The Convention has now produced a constitutional blueprint with a broad institutional balance .
I would also like to say right away that our group can support the draft Constitution .
That was followed by the war , and as you all know , weapons of mass destruction have still not been found .
We hope that the Intergovernmental Conference will be able to go further : on this and other matters , we are determined to prevent regression in respect of the Convention &apos;s conclusions .
Mr President , it is a great pleasure once again to be able to participate in this plenary session of the European Parliament to discuss issues which are essential to the European Union and to the World in general .
Additional proactive measures would help win the hearts and minds of the population and would reduce the attraction and influence of those who are so bitterly opposed to peace .
This will lend impetus to the peace process .
For that very reason , influential countries like the United States , or many other countries , or indeed the European Union , are in a stronger position to shape that world because it is a smaller place .
Perhaps a generous financial package of compensation to those who lost property might be the final answer .
The Palestinian Authority will be unable to resolve the security problem on its own .
We cannot simply divide between our security interests on the one hand and our development and trade interests on the other .
No .
I hope that they will follow this example .
It must also be borne in mind , however , that after enlargement we will have to add almost 600 000 more jobs to the two million already included in this sector , and many hundreds of thousands more in areas of industrial production such as Germany and Italy .
This can be done both through the community support framework and outside the community support framework , especially in the field of research and technology and innovation so that we can reinforce the sector as regards competitiveness , which is the key word .
To conclude , Mr President , I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results it has achieved , on the compromise reached between Council and Parliament , in which the Commission played a part and which should , we hope , enable this dossier to be concluded at first reading .
This report is a breakthrough and should be supported by all those who wish this institution well and who subscribe to the principles of transparency and accountability .
In financial terms , there are no large amounts involved - as yet .
The bill before the House tonight traduces these principles .
The Commission &apos;s statement makes hardly any reference to the transport sector .
Instead , Europe should support the public services to ensure those populations do have access to electricity and water .
This amendment is essential in order , as far as possible , to prevent the same accidents from happening again .
In conclusion I would like to underline that I consider Parliament &apos;s resolution to be a positive signal overall , and that the Commission will closely consider your suggestions .
Before we come to what I hope will be the conclusion to this matter , I would like to thank everyone most warmly : my fellow Members , the staff of the political groups and also the secretariat , all of whom have done such hard work on this .
In the throes of a codecision procedure , a large group like the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has the opportunity of using its large quantity of votes to prevent us from obtaining the 314 votes we need and , through preferential negotiations , has the considerable power to land Parliament with results that we cannot then alter .
The Commission will make use of all the management tools available on the basis of scientific advice .
It would be ludicrous , however , to ignore the impact such activities have on the fisheries sector and on fish stocks .
The translations had to be carried out very quickly between Monday and Wednesday .
The Cohesion Fund has played a decisive role in lessening these asymmetries by supporting those Member States with greater structural difficulties .
The citizens in the Member States , who are supposed to contribute tax money to the proposed European parties , will view these as artificial bodies intended to reduce the influence of the national parties and to impose political integration from the top down .
. ( PT ) As I wrote in my explanation of vote on the Markov report , here too one of the main problems of the Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre @-@ Accession ( ISPA ) - the development programme aimed at eight of the countries in the process of accession , for the year 2001 - is the persistence of difficulties associated with fund utilisation procedures .
I should have liked to see a debate , but it would be good if we could take a decision on this issue in the course of this week .
Mr President , I have taken the floor to speak on this report because , at last , Parliament is taking into consideration the specific nature of the request made by the national authorities when addressing the issue of immunity .
Instead of having to use 15 separate prospectuses to reach retail investors in the existing European Union , in future an issuer of bonds or shares will only need one .
Having succeeded in sweetening them with a taste of the profits so that they gamble all their savings , by applying the idea of easy money , they have also managed to turn their heads by inciting them to raise gambling to an art form .
I believe that this is a cause of which the rapporteur was a great supporter , and he has won the day .
In full accordance with the current state of jurisprudence , the common positions already clarify that environmental characteristics may be used as award criteria and that it is not necessary to show that each and every award criterion taking individually provides an economic benefit for the contracting authorities or entities .
Let us go forward , colleagues !
They believe that the Commission &apos;s proposal would , in a number of respects , reduce their efficiency without increasing either competition or legal certainty .
The tool of public markets could help us towards that aim .
Mr MacCormick referred to the current state of jurisprudence .
The European Commission stated that it had approximately EUR 140 million at its disposal .
We must show the same political drive in the field of asylum .
All in all , this has been a profitable six months for the European Union , despite the huge costs of war and the difficult economic position .
Mr President , the draft treaty presented by Mr Giscard d &apos;Estaing is only one draft constitution among many .
It is worth saying that the text of the Convention was not a consensual one and nor could it have been .
Fourthly and lastly , the matter of the Constitutional Treaty really did progress , but with opaque and , in my opinion , very dangerous procedures , which may even change the essence of everything the Convention has done .
This strikes me as extremely important , provided this does not simply look into the extent to which the current situation at the start of the negotiations about other chapters can be maintained as much as possible .
On the arduous path to a Common Foreign and Security Policy , a post of common foreign minister has now also been created , which is supposed to combine the two functions carried out by the previous agents .
We also hope that you will perhaps consider , together with your colleagues in the Council and the Commission , easing the visa requirements in a number of fields and for particular professions , so that people are able to gain faster entry to the European Union .
We cannot solve the problem of illegal immigration just by clamping down at this end : that is a sure , confirmed fact and it is the basis of our initiative , but our partners will have to cooperate responsibly in this initiative of ours .
First there is the transport issue , which actually comes under the heading of the rules which the European Union has provided itself with in the context of the liberalisation of air transport , which prohibits equalisations and the servicing of lines that are not necessarily , immediately and permanently profitable according to the criteria of the law of the market .
I wanted European legislation to be logical ; if genetically modified organisms are authorised centrally then the rules for coexistence should also be laid down centrally .
It is the current ban on growing and importing GMOs that for years has cut off Europe &apos;s scientific community , its consumers and farmers from the positive developments in the field of green genetic engineering .
We also know that these countries are certainly in no position to buy expensive seed from the US genetic engineering industry .
I represent Wales , a country where the National Assembly tried to implement separation distances between GM and non @-@ GM crops , only to be informed by the Commission that this action was not legally sustainable .
The liability of those who introduce GMOs into the environment , and I am thinking in particular here of the seed industry , including European companies , must be clearly established in accordance with the &apos; polluter pays &apos; principle . In other words , the cost of remedying the damage must be borne by GMO farming .
With regard to the labelling of authorised GMOs , we know that the food industry can detect the presence of even 0.1 % of GMOs .
In those circumstances , reflecting the views of those who asked us to engage in this exercise and provide this legislation , we have now come to the stage when we must lift the de facto moratorium .
For those of you who are not familiar with G10 , I would like to briefly explain the background to this initiative .
The review is supported by G10 and now has the support of the Member States .
I should just like to say a word about the pending research .
We are considering this step , particularly because these negotiations - especially in the field of agriculture - cannot be separated , in terms of a bargaining chip for the EU , from what is happening in the multilateral context of the World Trade Organisation .
What we have on the table is a text with which we agree . The Americans do not agree with it because they do not have confidence in the system .
I wish to thank the Commissioner for his answer , but I still think he is leaving the basic question unanswered , namely that of mutual solidarity and of conduct towards each other in the European Union .
When products subject to a notification originate from a third country , its competent authorities are systematically informed in order to enable them to correct the problem at source and prevent further cases .
Other measures to reduce the transmission of BSE are improved rendering standards - which came into effect in early 1997 - and a ban on the use of so @-@ called BSE risk materials in food and feed , which became effective in October 2000 .
My proposal , which became our proposal following contact with the other political groups , was that we should propose to the Council that the substances be kept for the purposes of the two less important areas relating to dead foetuses and pyometra .
We are glad that there will be more research into safety and into efficient alternatives , so that eventually we can move away from them altogether .
Recycling costs money , but it does produce something as well .
I believe that the Council &apos;s common position is pretty balanced .
I have to tell you , Commissioner , you are the guardian of the laws , and you have to intervene at a much earlier stage .
The IPP strategy has to do with this , our resource @-@ use strategy as well as a new waste @-@ recycling strategy .
Of course , we might have secured more , but speed is of the essence .
He has fought with much energy , determination and expertise for a good and practical system of greenhouse gas emissions trading .
This happens in particular in Dutch companies and this chicken meat , if you can still call it chicken meat , is then sold in the UK as Halal to the Muslims and Kosher to the Jews .
Another important point for this budget : we want to promote economic development in the new Member States .
In view of the current debates - in Poland in particular , where ministers have resigned because they are evidently missing the opportunity to actually create the structures there that will allow the money to be used properly - I believe that all states must understand that no money can flow if the relevant structures are not in place .
Finally , one of the basic problems we have when it comes to implementing the budget is that , overall , we have a rigid budgetary system that really needs to be modernised and altered .
Thirdly , on the subject of &apos; children and development &apos; , the Commission is pursuing the Millennium Development Goals as its objectives , in particular the achievement of universal primary education and the reduction of infant and child mortality .
The fight against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , and support for the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are specific areas in which to test our ability to build a solid relationship of cooperation between the two shores of the Atlantic .
For vision , because we really are laying the foundations for the Europe of decades to come , and we cannot accept short @-@ term solutions that merely respond to the - albeit difficult - current economic climate .
However , I hope you agree that the spending you propose on TENs and on defence must be compatible with Member States &apos; commitments under the Stability Pact , which is already under great strain .
In order to stop this happening , every technological invention must be subject to a European screening process , a scientific experimental control process which provides the guarantee that it is safe to use .
Therefore , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , we shall not oppose you for the sake of this Europe , but for the sake of another Europe : a social and democratic Europe .
Here , as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you will not have it .
This suggests to me that the real reason for this delay and the lack of information is simply because this presidency is not ready .
I would ask you please to do everything necessary to make it possible .
This is the important Europe that we have to address , by moulding the economic structure to the growth of these ordinary people , who should not have to live with the insecurity and instability in which the globalised economy would trap them .
If you read page 49 of our programme , Mrs Frassoni , you will find that we want to introduce high levels of environmental protection ; our policy , over and above the way it is being misrepresented , is directed precisely towards greater protection of the environment , and we are the first to be puzzled by the fact that , all too often , the expansion of production and industry has been to the detriment of the environment .
From this perspective , the amendments tabled by the rapporteur to the Council common position aim to make regulations more flexible , to speed up the procedure for approving the prospectus and reduce the scope for independent decision @-@ making by Member States and national legislations .
The problems associated with genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) turn on apparently contradictory issues .
These are thus the difficult circumstances under which these courageous officials have the European total ban on the use of hormones enforced .
Saving the planet is the responsibility of us all , all the rich countries , all industries , including transport , and also individuals .
Secondly , it is obvious that all parties are tired of war and want peace .
Mr President , Commissioner , one thing of which I am certain , having taken part in this delegation , is that , today , it is completely inappropriate to apply the word &apos; peace &apos; to Chechnya . Three thousand were killed at the start of the year .
Needless to say , we welcome in this framework the agreement that the European Union reached in the Council last week concerning the reforms of its agricultural policy , a result on which we would particularly congratulate Commissioner Fischler .
We have a duty to our own consumers and to our farmers to maintain the stability of national agricultural markets and protect them from international price fluctuations and to uphold the models of production and land use which are typical features of European agriculture .
What the EU should focus upon is ensuring that every country has its say in the negotiations and not only , as is usually the case , the rich and privileged countries that will take care of their own interests .
The fact is that these firms employ two @-@ thirds of the European Union &apos;s workforce , and I believe that it is worth our while to stand up for them .
It is certainly an honour since Italy has , from the very beginning , been among the Court &apos;s major supporters and has given its name to the Rome Statute .
The new accession countries are , at the same time , new NATO members ; it is to be seen how serious the Americans still take the existence of NATO if military assistance is simply withdrawn .
Subject : Suicide attacks against European targets in Casablanca
Moreover , the European Union will also continue to express its general concern in this field - in order to promote the protection of human dignity without distinguishing between men and women , with particular reference to women &apos;s rights - in international organisations , starting with the United Nations .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , there are silences that speak volumes , which make themselves heard , and the complicity of which is horrifying .
However , Commissioner , I do not believe that the Council has achieved the maximum possible in this field .
If it is about affirming the desire to distinguish the role of the operator and that of the regulator and increase transparency , the requirement should take into account the real situations that show that different concepts can also work .
We are therefore once again expressing our opposition to this increased privatisation of the sky , which is damaging both to users and to air transport employees in the broad sense , and to the people in the flight path .
Thus , of necessity , things are moving towards the conciliation procedure .
Let us then proceed to conciliation : the positions of the Council and the countries concerned still differ , as everyone is aware , and that means that we have to find a satisfactory solution in conciliation by the end of this year .
The vote will be at 12 noon tomorrow .
I am equally sure that these regulations cannot have been intended to apply to them with the same rigour as to fully @-@ fledged airlines .
In my view , they should trigger huge demand , above all in rail transport , where - as is well known - the obstacles are numerous .
There is no doubt that , even by today &apos;s standards , these tests appear to be the most effective and the most cost @-@ efficient , as well as to be the only ones available , but this is where criticism has to start .
It is an annual report about a very eventful year ; a year in which citizens had their first chance to show their confidence in the euro ; and a year which was preceded by higher expectations as regards economic recovery following the September 11 attacks .
Upon accession , the new Member States will join Economic and Monetary Union with the status of &apos; countries with a derogation &apos; , and their central banks will immediately become part of the European System of Central Banks .
What contribution can the ECB make to overcome the lack of structural reforms necessary in order to attain the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy ?
I should like to say to Mr Karas , who has a three @-@ year @-@ old son , that I have eight grandchildren of about the same age .
It was Jacques Delors who said that the euro was not enough .
The first conclusion to be drawn from the introduction of the euro is a considerable increase in the cost of the shopping basket of the housewife , who , Mr Gasòliba , contrary to what you have written , is far from being purely a psychological illusion , and whom I am not confusing with inflation .
Few people are aware of the impact of budget policy decisions on women in economic , social , and societal terms .
Equally important is the consensus reached on the Union &apos;s position regarding the agreement with the USA on extradition and judicial cooperation in criminal matters .
Germany and Italy want free passage through Austria and Switzerland , but the latter two countries want to protect their valleys against those flows of heavy goods vehicles , and want to transfer transport quickly over to the railways .
. ( EL ) The ? U is going to Cancun having carried out what is for farmers a disastrous interim reform of the CAP , which it is offering as a &apos; gift &apos; to the competitive global market in agricultural products .
My supplementary question also met with a contemptuous and deafening silence .
I speak also on behalf of the rapporteur when I ask the House to support us in seeking this , and I appeal to the Commission to include this dimension .
However , it does not highlight the causes or who is responsible for this situation .
The decision adopted on 2 April 2003 concludes , on the basis of a repeated ruling of the Court of Justice , that , firstly , there is a price agreement which violates the provisions of Article 81 of the Treaty and that , secondly , there is an agreement to suspend imports from other Member States , which also violates Community competition rules .
Nor , I believe , can we expect them to do so in view of the history on which this country can look back .
Thierry Falise and Vincent Reynaud were in fact convicted simply for carrying out their work as journalists and cameramen , filming a group of mountain people who have been hounded for years by an authoritarian regime that flouts every principle of democracy .
B5 @-@ 0355 / 2003 by Mr Johan Van Hecke , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on the kidnapping of children by the Lord &apos;s Resistance Army ( LRA ) ;
Since this agenda has no public appeal , Kony abducts children to lead his war .
This is a matter on which the European Court of Human Rights has registered its protest and noted that this is a violation of Article 2 . I would call upon the House to appeal to Mr Denktash to reverse his decision not to allow the secondary schools to reopen .
I was in the role of rapporteur during the conciliation procedure .
I would like to conclude my talk by referring to what is , for me , a very long @-@ held conviction .
This is a human , economic and ecological balance @-@ sheet that might have been even more serious had it not been for the bravery and the efficiency of the fire @-@ fighters , many of whom are volunteers , for the assistance given by the Red Cross to the communities affected , for the solidarity that European States have shown one another , not forgetting the substantial cooperation of third countries .
With regard to the forests and forest fires , we would first of all express our heartfelt condolences to the victims of these fires , above all in Portugal but also in the other countries that have suffered the same disasters , for we are concerned here with genuine environmental disasters in Southern Europe .
( The President cut off the speaker )
That is why we are calling upon the Commission to draw up a Green Paper on the protection of elderly people and combating climate and , more generally , health risks , on the basis of European best practice .
In spite of the indisputable beneficial effects of this regulation , the Commission - as many of us have pointed out - has transferred only the fire surveillance aspect to its &apos; Forest Focus &apos; proposal .
As it happens , I have a longstanding and keen interest in the provision of cycle tracks and I will tell Mrs de Palacio that the European Parliament is determined to see progress made here .
I believe the new capital framework will be good for financial stability , that it will be good for financial institutions and that it will be good for their customers .
I would also like to emphasise that it is very important that the crucial points that have been brought up by Charles Goodhart &apos;s research group from the London School of Economics should also be clarified , in particular those referring to the procyclicality of Basel II , to which reference has already been made .
In order to make the problem understandable , I have confined myself to raising the basic question to which the report gives a positive answer , in other words the extent to which the Community can impose an obligation on the Member States to make provision for criminal sanctions for serious infringements of Community law .
emphasises the fact that the Commission ought to pay special attention to those regions suffering from the statistical effects of enlargement and to treat them as regions similar to Objective 1 areas ;
Integration means establishing social and economic cohesion in an EU of 25 and , if you will pardon my saying so Commissioner , you still have not given us your blueprint for achieving this , although it is high time that you did so .
Therefore , we need to preserve the European Union &apos;s minimum intervention threshold , we need to stem the flow of people leaving mountain areas , we need to intervene in disadvantaged islands , which are disadvantaged not only because of their distance from mainland Europe but also because of inherent problems to which Europe must find an immediate solution .
We must now , in connection with enlargement , have a solidarity policy , and we must bind Europe together .
I therefore ask you to confirm in the House that concentration will remain a valid principle in the future . Structural aid would then continue to be channelled mainly to the most disadvantaged regions of Europe .
The report I am presenting states that this should be the case .
There are also objective reasons .
In principle , I think that it is important for us to only regulate on a European level things that actually have added value .
This agreement is intended to guarantee fair and non @-@ discriminatory treatment of European and Chinese shipping companies in each party &apos;s respective ports and thus enable trade between the European Union and China to be carried on even more smoothly .
For these reasons , it is of crucial importance to be able to depend on guaranteed minimum qualification requirements for crew members , whatever their country of origin .
( Parliament adopted the text )
Mr President , I could not wait to take the floor once again in this Chamber and , not least , to deliver these explanations of vote .
The facility to increase funding to disadvantaged regions , depending on the extent of their handicaps , is particularly important .
In amending this regulation , we are constrained by a strict legal base within the Treaties and by numerous Court of Justice rulings about the scope of the regulation : definitions of social security and not social welfare in general , for example .
I should like to underpin this with a few examples .
For that reason , the application regulation and annexes are of major importance .
It is a nonsense to think that we can go beyond the current 2 % of movement to a real movement of labour if we do not get serious about this issue .
The fishing opportunities relating to the remaining EUR 28 million have a very low take up .
In the ten @-@ year period that we feel must now be started in order to ensure that the European institutions discuss the status of the &apos; Western waters &apos; , a thorough review must be conducted of the issue of access to waters , European legislation must be adapted to the broad principles of International Maritime Law and the best ways of safeguarding sustainable fisheries in the Atlantic must be studied .
That is why the stocks are run down .
How do we reconcile our desire for the WTO to focus on a multilateral accord on a number of principles governing investment , and our aspirations in terms of development ?
This represents 10 % of the problem . We still need to deal with the difficulties that are not linked to the patent problem , namely the problems of finance , production and availability .
Iran wants to have a better relationship with us and the rest of the world .
( DE ) Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I can give a succinct answer to that .
.
Compare these sums , Commissioner , with those you have just mentioned , which are totally inadequate .
We must be inclusive .
We need her to do so ; indeed , in the vote that will take place tomorrow we call on her to do so .
Neither of these two rights can be exercised by the disabled unless they are given the right language .
In essence , then , this amendment is no longer necessary .
The programme has been implemented well and the funds used efficiently and , given the wealth of interest , there are clearly sound reasons for increasing the budget for DAPHNE , and also by an amount larger than the general budget increase we normally give in connection with enlargement .
Clearly , all types of violence merit being included within the scope of this text , especially when those most vulnerable are affected .
Despite this , domestic violence , sexual violence and violence perpetrated against women and children are still a huge taboo .
Your second point of concern is perhaps the most important one : to what extent the current accounts reflect that reality of the new agricultural policy which we wish to define by means of other criteria .
The main tasks of the delegation are not only to assist with the implementation of aid programmes and projects , but also to promote a political dialogue with the Cuban authorities and civil society , to monitor human rights issues and to protect the interests of the Member States in terms of trade and investments .
The draft compromise resolution , which will be voted on tomorrow , contains a condemnation of the closure of the Spanish Cultural Centre in Havana .
Lastly , Mr President , I am not forgetting that you have given the European Convention a home on your premises .
We cannot alter one part of the building without risking bringing down the entire construction .
This is a good thing because , above all , the text has great symbolic value : this is the first time the Union &apos;s foundations have been debated in an open , democratic forum representative of the peoples and States of Europe .
We know how fragile some solutions are , the compromise on the size of the Commission and on voting in it being one example .
It has to be said that they were added on the quiet and after the event , right in the middle of July so that the majority of editions of the Constitution in circulation quite simply ignore them .
Mr President of the Commission , we have had debates .
I much appreciated your contributions during the Convention because you defended neither particular interests nor lobbies .
This morning , before I came to the European Parliament , I met Mr Fatuzzo as he was aged 18 , who , many years ago , worked as a sailor on cruise ships sailing between New York and the Bahamas .
( DE ) Today , I have taken a firm stand in favour of extending the EU &apos;s Action Programme to prevent violence against children , young people and women ( Daphne II ) from 2003 to 2008 .
We must indeed &apos; facilitate the fulfilment of the aspirations of disabled people &apos; !
The question before us is not whether we should be involved in the reconstruction of Iraq , but how we should be involved and what is required for it to be a success .
Recently , we saw the killing of the Shia Muslim leader , Mohammed Baquer Hakim . Not that I think he was a hero .
Trials are essential , but Iraqi judges cannot carry the burden alone .
I would like to say , however , that the instability and the attacks on the US and UK forces are a problem for everyone - they have been right from the start , right from the first attack - and not just for the coalition forces .
What is the opinion of the Commission and the Council ?
Thus far , the EU has noted with satisfaction that the de facto moratorium on stoning is still a reality .
Personally , in spite of many doubts , I have nevertheless concluded that this report is useful and I congratulate my colleague Mr van den Bos .
This is an urgent matter .
I am thinking , in particular , of the concern regarding the fact that citizens , European nationals , are today being held in what I would call great secrecy in Cuba because they are suspected of have carried out terrorist acts .
Where does the Commission itself stand on this , and when will it show the political courage to raise human rights issues in the European Union ?
I would refer in this connection to the shameful statements made by some of his group colleagues during the debate on Cuba this morning .
The Council therefore notes that , in order to establish an effective migration policy , we need to develop a genuine partnership with third countries to bring about more effective , common management of migration flows .
What does the Council consider to be the legal status and responsibilities of the occupying forces in Iraq , and how can they guarantee the fundamental rights of the inhabitants of the country &apos;s occupied areas ?
Mr President , I cannot help but say that one of the problems in this world is that there is too little jungle left .
One reason why I think Mr Lannoye &apos;s report is so good is that he focuses very directly , and also very critically , on the problems and obstacles standing in the way of sustainable water management .
Working conditions , including child labour , merit more specific detail in the Commission document .
This round of trade talks must truly be a development round .
In my group , as my colleague has already said , there are different thoughts about this .
Doing this brings us to something that adds up to more than 40 % of the programming for the 9th EDF .
I would prefer to tell you briefly why I decided some time ago to stand for the European Parliament .
Whenever the EU gives any aid to any poor country , please let us inform the population what we are doing : how much money we are giving for each sector and to which actors or players or stakeholders this money is being given .
Our report , however , makes many critical observations , all in the best spirit and in the hope that in subsequent years the shortcomings and insufficiencies will be overcome .
Would the President like one ?
Indeed , the Parliament itself provides its own delegations travelling abroad only with interpreting services into English , as was recently the case with the delegation to Japan , and that leads me to believe that we are going down a dangerous path .
The rapporteur , Mr Ebner , has done an excellent job .
Nevertheless , recent technological developments call for more detailed reflection .
This has been stated clearly both by those working in the industry and by the Commission .
We need here to analyse the cultural , commercial and economic dimension in order to include the sectors in the definition of cultural or creative industries , as they are called in certain countries .
This morning &apos;s debate on the cultural package is closed .
This is about the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and we are not here to decide what should be retained or completely removed .
It is a sad fact that successive Spanish Governments have failed to champion the official languages recognised by the relevant Statutes of Autonomy , earmarking for development the principles and rights of the Spanish Constitution itself .
I object to this behaviour .
This just shows the ideological misuse of the issue of human rights .
.
Climate change will make this situation worse .
.
The Commission and the Member States bear separate and full responsibility for this , since they both have obligations to act to solve the problem .
The Commission has publicly announced that Israel improperly issues proofs of origin to settlement products , but why has the Commission done nothing effective about it ?
We follow general principles and criteria as regards how much processing is necessary before the origin of a product is decided .
The communication about the untying of aid dates back to 18 November 2002 and we still have quite some work to do , even though we have made good political progress on the issue since last year .
The issue of the capability to sustain a secular state with religious tolerance is now before us , as is the question of whether the tension with Pakistan will be cooled and whether intercommunal relations in India will become peaceful .
Fourteen years of violence and misrule in Liberia resulted in immense human suffering amongst civilians , as well as gross human rights violations , a breakdown in social and economic structures , and now 85 % of the population is living below the poverty line .
We call on the Council and the Commission to show their readiness , in collaboration with the United States , to help facilitate the national reconciliation process in Burma .
Such a move could enable these countries , if they see fit , to promote competition between suppliers of goods or services , thereby potentially reducing additional costs and the risks of corruption inherent in tied aid .
The basic political question is whether or not to refer this report back to committee .
We then had to go through all the regulations , both European and international , in order to see where we could make improvements .
However , we can say something very important and that is that this time we have taken decisions , this time we have acted .
For example , there is a problem with the disposal of waste in ports .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this issue is , as you know , of immense concern not only to our group but also to me personally , as a Portuguese Member of this House .
That is a road on which we can make further progress .

Major problems result from this latter not being done , and from these installations being used infrequently .
Only in that way can we include third countries and ships not registered in any country in the same objective .
When it comes to gas , the Directive is aimed , in a nutshell , at guaranteeing a daily and operative security of supply within a competitive environment .
The problem needs , though , to be seen in the medium and long term context ; it will not be capable of being solved without the development of alternative fuels and alternative propulsion technologies , or without changes in our overall patterns of mobility .
Gas cannot be stored in the same way as oil .
There must also be a necessary reserve of key energy products in stock .
Mr Schmidt has clearly understood that Parliament does not want to turn its attention away from really important matters , and that it is not prepared to take short @-@ cuts which do not actually lead anywhere .
We must also remember that we cannot implement policies liable to encourage waves of illegal immigration , involving the trafficking and exploitation of individuals .
The task is to define the role of the Central Bank in a globalised world dominated by trade , commerce and international financial markets .
It is of the greatest importance that we adhere to the rules of the Stability Pact without political games and without interpreting the rules to promote our own interests .
At a time when many of our traditional industries are migrating to China and the Far East , we need to rely on our innovation and inventiveness to earn our living .
We believe that intellectual property in the field of computers must be maintained and that we need a Community Directive which just regulates industrial applications , not computer programs , and which regulates it in a sufficiently clear way to prevent us from taking that route , so that the jurisprudence of the European Patent Office does not drag the countries of the European Union along the road of the patentability of computer @-@ implemented inventions as such .
The Radical Members of the Bonino List will vote in favour of the amendments seeking to restrict the margin of software patentability and will vote against the proposal as a whole if the main amendments are not adopted .
You claimed in your statement , Commissioner , which was extremely aggressive and even threatening with regard to the criticism inspired by your draft directive , that software as such was not covered by patentability .
However , what we are doing is applying traditional patent law to small- and medium @-@ sized businesses , in the knowledge that patents have increased growth and have made it possible for all types of companies - including small ones - to carry out research and invest in new developments .
My staff have been bullied to the extent that one of them had to take days off with a stress @-@ related illness .
Are there any objections to that oral amendment ?
It has now been suggested that he be given a further period of eight years .
Although he states that a commercial trade mark may in no event be at the same time a geographical indication or designation of origin , the rapporteur also says that the indication or designation may be included in the trademark when the products covered have the right to bear it .
Now , the oil from the Prestige continues each day to pollute the whole of the Atlantic coast up to the Channel .
We now have a minister who will sit here for three hours or so in a budgetary debate , as we had last year , which says a lot about the Council .
Therefore , I would like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office &apos;s opinion about the approach that I have taken on his decisions .
We wonder which of these figures is correct .
Up to now we have always put the emphasis on the quantitative side of this .
We cover something like 120 budget lines with reference to ten different directorates @-@ general .
I also note that the committees and groups have submitted amendments for external policy which amount to EUR 841 million more than the Commission &apos;s proposals .
Next week - on 1 October - we will have the opportunity to debate this in a joint meeting of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , when the Commission will be putting forward a proposal that the margin and also part of the flexibility reserve be used for Iraq , and will be submitting an amending budget .
As young people &apos;s health is always of very great importance to us , we should be building up the school milk programme , rather than virtually freezing its current funding in the way that the Council has decided .
We were simply being realistic about what has to be done in and for a bigger Union .
That will be very welcome .
We now have one with the new n + 2 rule and it is starting to bear fruit .
It is a positive sign that enlargement is being taken into consideration in the Socrates @-@ Youth programme and Culture 2000 programme .
I would also like to stress , as Mr Perry has said , that we attach great importance to the use of audiovisual systems .
We need some EUR 4000 million if we are really going to be able to act as the driving force behind the construction of networks of a trans @-@ European nature , and not of a solely national nature .
This is a necessary condition for healthy European industry and for lasting employment . &apos; 
We might have had you to thank for the ruin of Schneider and of Legrand .
Mr Wurtz said that the Commission has discretionary power in the field of competition which is not subject to control .
It has acquired new foundations for national cohesion and social solidarity .
The definition of such bodies must be strict .
In some cases , that has to do with the pensions systems , but the main reason is women &apos;s position in the labour market .
Unfortunately , this undertaking is contradictory and causes the rapporteur to call into question fundamental social principles in the name of financial criteria .
a reference to the growing difficulties faced by pension funds in the wake of the worldwide stock market slump , which provides ample proof that the growing risks of the financial market have an adverse effect on the adequacy and sustainability of funded pension provision ;
Having referred to the position adopted by Parliament in 1999 and taken into consideration new political material such as the Gothenburg European Council &apos;s declaration in favour of a Sustainable Development Strategy , as rapporteur I therefore proposed to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that we should reinforce Council &apos;s position on certain points , while retaining a moderate stance bearing in mind the different political sensitivities .
Now is the time to put the disappointment to one side ; making headway in the debate on the directive is the next step in an inevitable direction .
That was a useful meeting in which we discussed all the main issues and agreed to put our officials to work to make further efforts to find a solution in the coming weeks .
Secondly , we appreciate the work carried out on the suitability test - Article 18 .
As it stands , the report that was adopted proposes a system of regulation that is inferior to that enjoyed by the United States .
We consider that the current exemption for commodity derivatives and the dealers of such instruments should apply on a consolidated basis .
Parliament &apos;s opinion , in the text approved to date by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , has provided valuable support for our efforts , as have the speeches given by the rapporteurs who spoke before me and strongly confirmed this intention .
My colleagues will analyse in detail the aspects which we consider fundamental , with greater authority than my own .
It is to be adopted on 13 December and signed on 9 May , whereupon we can go to the polls and participate in referendums , but not change the Constitution .
Fortunately , things went well in the end .
This is an inadequate structure in a Community of over 25 Member States .
The terms of a constitution can be amended by a qualified or overqualified majority . Constitutions are never amended by unanimity , however .
The Intergovernmental Conference is only an assembly of all the governments .
Lastly , there is the issue of price stability .
It may rouse the whole gamut of emotions , but it will not be denied its role as the precursor of a new Europe , based on democracy , human rights , equality and European solidarity .
We leave them to the judgment of our peoples .
We await a common position from Council and Commission .
We have grave reservations about this directive .
The unsustainability of many national pension systems is due to demographic change , and we may be sure that it will indubitably do serious and - unless something is done to stop it - irreparable harm to all retired workers , both now and in future .
Besides the fact that the questions are always skewed by the authorities asking them , we do not consider referenda to be a way for the citizens to express their will in a social structure in which the wealthy hold a monopoly over information tools and the media .
. ( FR ) We thought that with the draft European Constitution we had seen everything , but obviously we did not count on this new report , which is supposed to express Parliament &apos;s position on the forthcoming IGC .
At their informal meeting in Riva del Garda at the beginning of September , the EU Foreign Ministers decided to add the political wing of Hamas to Europe &apos;s list of terrorist organisations .
We have also provided more than EUR 30 million for the vital work of Palestinian municipalities in providing basic public services , because that is how you fight despair - with clean water and classrooms ; with the promise of normality and peace .
All these praiseworthy attempts eventually foundered on one person &apos;s thirst for power , that person being &apos; raïs &apos; Yasser Arafat .
The American presence will reassure the Israelis , who rightly see the US as their unquestioning and loyal ally .
What have we done to ensure that the Palestinians do their duties , such as to support Abu Mazen so that he may have a single police force or to demand that Arafat concede some of his powers to a minister who he himself had supported ?
In the event of failure , however , the reverse is true .
We were sat there and followed the negotiations between a number of protagonists , including the United States , the European Union , the G @-@ 21 and the ACP countries .
I also believe that it would be suicidal for employment in Europe not to see that China , to be followed in future by others , is emerging with huge comparative advantages .
It was mainly a matter of the timetable .
We are being asked for transparency and clarification .
Finally , on the Singapore issues : are you aware , Commissioner , that on Thursday the DTI Minister in the UK said that she would be seeking a meeting with you on the Singapore issues to ensure that you stick to the position that was taken in Cancún and that we will no longer press for negotiations at the WTO on investment and competition ?
The EU and US positions ignore the need for debt relief for the least @-@ developed countries , and ignore the problems faced by workers and by micro- , small- and medium @-@ sized enterprises within Europe itself , in sectors such as textiles , clothing , footwear and agriculture .
We made those reforms ourselves - and I am pleased to remind you about that here , because we had that very debate here in this Chamber .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we do not , of course , have to re @-@ invent the trans @-@ European networks , because we have them already .
There is not much point in holding the debate if the Commission and the Council are not here , but let us , at least , use it to discuss the matter amongst ourselves ; in any case , there are very few of us left in the Chamber .
Users will therefore definitely come along for different applications , for 3G , 4G or 5G , when there is meaningful content .
After all , information does not shrink at the point from which it is distributed to others , no matter how much of it is shared .
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to thank Mr Cashman for his work and congratulate him on his detailed report on the issue we are debating today , namely transparency .
Nonetheless , it would be appropriate to draw up some kind of proposal requesting Member States to be just as transparent as Community institutions .
There is still a good deal to do where these are concerned .
Then there are many amendments relating to the thresholds , in other words the percentages proposed by the Commission and changed by Parliament in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
It is an extremely sound proposal which will entail a considerable improvement where such emissions are concerned .
Thank you for your explanation , Commissioner .
We also need , step by step , to stop using substances that remain toxic for long periods .
It seems to me a good idea to examine all of our legislation and policies against sustainable development : primarily policies with clear external implications , but also more internal matters such as the Directive on paints .
As well as reacting to the complaints that are received , the Ombudsman should also have a proactive role in promoting democratic values , empowering citizens and widening the choices available to them .
It is something of an irony of fate that we are today discussing the report of the Ombudsman , whose job it is to combat bad administration , when the rest of the House is full of rumours about maladministration and Eurostat .
Mr President , the role played by the Committee on Petitions must become more widely known amongst the citizens .
He has to bring a Member State into compliance .
As stated in all the advertisements : you cannot guarantee that past profit is an indication of future gain .
( The sitting was suspended at 11.59 a.m. and resumed at 12 noon )
I am opposed to the amendment which aims to increase the maximum boiling point for a volatile organic compound from 250 ° C to 280 ° C. Since this has practically no environmental benefits , and since it is even doubtful whether it complies with the eco @-@ labelling rules , this amendment may have highly negative repercussions for paint @-@ manufacturing SMEs .
I come now to the European Parliament : on 10 April of this year , on the basis of the Morillon report , the European Parliament set out its views on defence policy , and in particular proposed a two @-@ stage plan .
All this , which is expressed through the constant militarisation of the European Union , in ever closer cooperation with ? ? ? ? , calls for huge quantities of arms .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to restate that the Commission does not intend to stop overnight all funding awarded to rehabilitation centres .
We address this publicly , for example in the human rights dialogue that is underway with this country .
It has been provided with information on the decline in bee populations in some Member States , as you yourself have solemnly emphasised .
It is Dr Lee &apos;s first visit to the European Parliament .
I would like to deal with the second of the two reasons first : the right time and circumstances .
A sociologist from the United States , Fredson , demonstrates in his work that the system of the professions corresponds to the work ethic , which has to strike a fair balance - and I agree with Commissioner Monti on this - between profit and the implementation of rules , which are the hallmarks of the market and of bureaucracy .
At the next Council , the Commission will fulfil the mandate assigned to it by the European Council by presenting a series of measures with a view to completing the common policy .
Please do not allow every page of the Convention &apos;s proposals to be completely renegotiated .
One alternative approach is for us to address monetary policy and hence the role and workings of the European Central Bank .
When prioritising , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I believe that we need to focus clearly on a Europe that is going from the West towards the East , but also at the Europe which is looking from the North to the South .
Because we have not yet reached any agreement on any of the old European common initiatives in the field of immigration .
Above all at a time when Parliament is increasing its legislative powers , it makes no sense for us to continue with this procedure for producing legislation .
My own feeling is that there is simply no way that we will achieve the general principles referred to in the common objectives in the agreement - namely legal certainty , the promotion of simplicity , clarity and consistency in the drafting of laws - if we do not make rapid progress - as called for in paragraph 25 - in establishing a common methodology to have environmental , social and economic impact assessments , not only attached to draft proposals from the Commission , but also in significant amendments tabled by ourselves and by the Council of Ministers .
Mr President , as we all know , the Commission has been preoccupied with the question of better governance of this Community model which is called the European Union for years now .
The quality of human resources and basic research , however , warrants greater attention . The future of the European Space policy depends on this being given .
We cannot separate one from the other .
We believe that Parliament should adopt a position offering a better guarantee here .
This is thus a reasonably wide definition , and one that is capable of offering the necessary flexibility and room for manoeuvre .
I would like to reassure the rapporteur , Mr Della Vedova , the draftsman , Mr Doorn , and also Mr Karas , Mr Mann and other Members about this basic principle .
Thirdly , I fully support the new ruling that , where tunnels impinge upon the territory of two Member States , joint investigating bodies are to be set up to exercise the necessary functions .
Firstly , may I say that I cannot answer for statements made by members of other parliaments , whoever or wherever they may be .
Are our European taxpayers &apos; monies going , in the future , to pay for the collapse of other fisheries agreements ?
I am frustrated because the Middle East is still bleeding to death . Life after life is still being lost needlessly .
It is understandable that the international community should be focusing its attention on the security issue , but we must not forget the need to strengthen institutions and undertake reforms .
Discussion of what should happen following implementation of the Road Map and the ensuing peace conference is best left until the time comes . I believe it is too early to discuss issues such as Jerusalem , Israel &apos;s withdrawal to the 1967 borders and refugees .
We are as yet unsure how the government being formed by Mr Abu Ala will fare . His track record has earned him the support of the House .
Is Israel prepared , after thirty @-@ five years of military occupation , to evacuate these territories and cede power back to the Palestinian Authority ?
I agree with her when she says that it is our duty to intervene and I share her indignation that we cannot be happy with moral stances , as we so often are , stances that ease our consciences , but , ladies and gentlemen , a clear conscience is the opposite of real conscience .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you .
The Commission , therefore , should review the regulations governing the mechanisms by which funds are allocated by the Solidarity Fund , which was created precisely in order to respond effectively to emergencies .
The resolution also supports the military use of satellite systems in carrying out what it euphemistically terms &apos; peacekeeping operations , &quot; which means paving the way for war operations , thus going against the spirit of United Nations General Assembly Resolution No 49 / 74 of 15 December 1994 on prevention of an arms race in outer space , and in particular Article 4 thereof .
I am glad that the Committee on Citizens &quot; Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has lent its unanimous support to a ban on the transmission of data by airlines and automated booking systems , if this discriminates against those who are not US citizens , the data is kept for long periods and if information or review procedures are not in place .
Mr President , I had the opportunity to be in Romania last week , where I observed the preparations for the referendum .
We can then come back to the colleagues who have asked these questions .
My group and I are going to support her , and I would also like to congratulate Mrs Wallström on her speech .
We need to make an effort to increase citizens &apos; sensitivity in the approach to and use made of forests .
There are several reasons why it makes sense to revise the directive after over a quarter of a century .
Who is going to be counting ?
As we know , it is the most significant global issue in the area of environmental sustainability and is having disastrous effects not only on the climate but on ecosystems and plant and animal species too .
Monitoring and reporting are of course crucial , and I can reassure Members of Parliament that I will also do everything in my power to make sure that we report to citizens on how Member States are doing .
All this is understandable , and so I believe that the compromise at which we have arrived is the right one .
We should not point the finger only at the United States .
These partnerships will be based on joint projects lasting a maximum of three years . They will focus mainly on the mobility of European students and teaching staff outside Europe .
I am therefore stressing that it is not only students from third countries who should be encouraged to have a command of at least two EU languages .
The setting up of virtual training rooms , for example , is one way of achieving the goal of exchanges of good practice between teachers in the different Member States , at both methodological and teaching level .
I would draw your attention to the fact that the overlap between the scopes of the Convention and the new regulation will , I am sure , make it easier to apply these two instruments in parallel .
Unless we take that step , the shift from road to rail and air to rail that is envisaged for the year 2010 will leave passenger traffic untouched .
Although there was general agreement on the common position , my report includes the proposals made by the relevant parliamentary committee at first reading . This is progress .
We are of course also eager to do so .
If we liberalise but do not strive to ensure that there are sufficient incentives for investment , there is a real danger that networks will collapse and that the seeds of insecurity will be sown .
Ladies and gentlemen , shipping has been liberalised for a great many years now .
The Sterckx , Ainardi and Savary reports are more in tune with the needs of today .
I would venture to remind you also , Commissioner , that road safety is another area of concern for us .
In this context , I feel that rapid liberalisation of the rail sector in all the Member States would favour this mode of transport as a credible alternative to rail and road transport , and as a means of combating the explosion in these sectors , which have disastrous effects on the environment and on regional planning .
This is logical , because June 2003 is now in the past .
Penal sanctions against the arsonists and those behind such acts should therefore be strengthened .
When the outcome of the vote was not as we had wished where these important points were concerned , we chose to vote against the proposal for a directive in the final vote .
We are to present a budget for 25 countries now , when we all know that we shall not have a European Union of 25 Member States until 1 May next year .
I want to take this opportunity to remind colleagues that the principle behind the statute for political parties was to enhance transparency , something which appears to have been forgotten by some groups in this House .
There needs to be some means of putting pressure on the Council . We are therefore retaining our amendment regarding the basic remuneration of the Council &apos;s staff .
For example , the excess on the allowances for Parliament &apos;s car service this year must be looked into carefully , and next year we cannot introduce a new system for claiming expenses for the use of taxis without a decision made in plenary .
We would point out that far from there allegedly being no code of conduct , there will certainly be measures to secure separation between types of expenditure - between information and political expenditure - and a code of conduct on the use of appropriations entered under this heading .
I agree with those who have commented upon the idiotic proposal to award ourselves additional taxi allowances outwith the budgetary process .
Where are you going to get it from ?
- Madam President , first of all , I , too , should like to thank Mr Mulder for the work he has done with such great balance and commitment that it has achieved a substantial consensus within the Committee on Budgets .
We have spent EUR 180 million on the ridiculous pilgrimage to Strasbourg ; we have wasted EUR 60 million on the Committee of the Regions - a talking shop that nobody listens to ; EUR 5 million have been nicked by corrupt officials in Eurostat .
So if they themselves say that , then who am I to give them extra money ?
During a visit to Bulgaria this summer I intervened in a very unconventional way to try to overcome this blockade .
That is the focus of my attention at the moment .
Having said that , this morning I discussed this very issue with your colleague , Mr Parish .
At present there is no decision and no agreement .
Irrespective of that , the Commission services have started a project to examine ways of promoting the use of rating systems that include technology risk assessments - in other words , technology ratings - to enable potential investors to appraise the specific risks and rewards associated with investments in technology @-@ based SMEs .
On the whole - and I am coming back to where I began - the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission has been so excellent because we held a European dialogue at European level on all of these issues , between insurers , automobile associations , Parliament , and associations of accident victims - I am referring here to the European Transport Law Seminars in Trier .
If the Commission has contributed to the report , it did so out of the conviction that this is the way to go .
The only problem is that , following these statements , when action should come , nothing happens .
The priority , however , is that women are able to use all resources so that they can enjoy their fundamental rights without any discrimination .
This is why the Commission is soon going to put forward an amending budget in order to cancel part of these appropriations .
However , the ultimate goal is , of course , for this Structural Funds policy to be better aligned to its objectives .
The Commission undertaking to re @-@ evaluate all sweeteners in the near future is also a decision that is in line with our objectives , as we are aware that we need consistent statistics and that we need to regularly re @-@ examine our positions in the light of the new data .
I too am in favour of scientific progress , but not everything that appears to be an improvement is actually in the consumer &apos;s best interests .
Perhaps in the case of a number of existing individual solutions , some well @-@ established importers do not necessarily suffer in their protected arrangements , but this does not compensate for the major losses incurred through the substantial decline in imports from other Member States as a result of this fragmentation of the German market for these products .
Deposit money was often used as a disguised form of protectionism in favour of the country &apos;s own products , for which there is no excuse whatsoever .
I also wish to thank you , however , for having contributed , on more than one occasion in the past , to calling for my freedom , which had been denied me when , during the twenty @-@ six years I spent as a member of the opposition , I had at times to deal with an authority that had little respect for democracy and human rights and which interrogated me , arrested me or threw me into prison according to its whim .
Countries must not be left completely unregulated , but we must , by means of national regulations , which everyone must respect , establish good governance and create security , or &apos; profitability &quot; which is the free transfer of profits .
Asia , and China in particular , has not been given as much attention in the report as might perhaps have been wished . The increased tensions in relations between China and North Korea is cause for concern , but what is more worrying is , of course , the fact that North Korea will not phase out its nuclear weapons programme .

We find that quite a number of our conservative friends , some liberals and unfortunately also some socialists are forgetting , or are trying to forget , Gothenburg and the need to include the environment .
I was happy to see this week &apos;s Commission proposal providing a blueprint for these regional advisory councils and how they would work , with two thirds of the membership of these new organisations coming from those active in the fisheries sector .
Last year , several TACs were set higher than ICES advised .
It is totally unacceptable that the UK Government has absolutely no intention , yet again , of doing anything other than increasing that pain .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
It is important , then , to draw up minimum standards defining the terms &apos; victim &quot; and &apos; crime , &quot; establishing which persons are eligible to benefit from compensation if the victim dies , and determining the methods and means of payment .
The tasks described in Mr Savary &apos;s report and partly , too , in Mr Sterckx &quot; report are urgent .
He would therefore combine very different responsibilities , leading to a formidable mix of styles .
The Palestinians have been unable to fulfil many of their commitments on the crucial issue of security .
Others have &apos; delocalised &quot; their production to Central Europe , and they sometimes subsequently transfer it to still poorer countries , sowing devastation behind them .
Furthermore , the regional and local administrations , which often , as in the case of marketing , are responsible for applying Community rules , must also feel that they are participating in decision @-@ making .
During the period 1998 to 2001 , at least 746 vessels were exported to third countries .
We must therefore expect a decrease in cotton production and we are aware that this reform will require adjustments on the part of the sector .
Mr President , Commissioner Lamy , I have long been endeavouring to extract from the Commission figures relating to the number of jobs to be lost in the leaf tobacco production sector , the related manufacturing industry and in associated sectors .
This is where it is very important that we should proceed with tact and sensitivity , rather than adopt a schoolmasterly and accusatory role , for ethnic misunderstandings and prejudices led us Europeans , too , to spend centuries smashing each others &quot; skulls in , and such things are still going on in Europe today .
As has already been quoted by other fellow Members , Turkmenistan is &apos; one of the worst totalitarian systems in the world . &quot;
We now have a delegation there .
She declined to do so .
On 27 July 2003 a tanker , the , with a local pilot at the helm , ran aground at the entrance to the port of Karachi .
Indeed , this will be one of the last big decisions that it will fall to my Commission to take in this term of office .
I should like to remind colleagues that we are not having a debate in substance now .
I agree with you , Mr Oostlander , that it is precisely in the area of the military that we had hoped for more progress in Turkey .
Rather , we are dealing with massive , extremely weighty and very emotional domestic disputes .
Therefore , and in view of the high stakes , all parties should adopt a flexible approach to the task of laying the foundations for the European Union of the twenty @-@ first century .
Mr President , the performance of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers causes me great concern too .
This is a task that the Council should have carried out .
The Convention &apos;s proposal regarding the weighting of votes must be held on to .
We were not rewarded by success , but we have kept the debate open on this matter , considering that the work of the Convention , on the one hand , and the demands of the European Parliament , on the other , are sufficient for the issue to be given a place in the final proposal .
Human rights , and especially women &apos;s rights , the rights of minorities and of indigenous peoples and the removal of inequalities are also the guiding principles of European cooperation policy in these regions .
Why a simple regulation ?
On the other hand , other amendments go much further in the opposite direction , and we cannot accept either Amendment 24 on youth or Amendment 24 on culture , both of which propose a substantial increase in the rate of the gradual reduction .
The Commission puts forward a proposal and implements the will of the legislator .
The Commission only adopted the proposals in May 2003 , and therefore we cannot realistically expect the first grants to be available before late summer 2004 .
Similarly , we have worrying evidence about the small percentage of women Internet users in the accession countries .
The Commission is of the view that this network must ensure the necessary exchange of information between immigration liaison officers and also the coordination that the Member States must develop with third countries in order to work together in the field of European immigration policy .
Adopting these common standards is crucial to increasing the confidence and the faith which members of the public and the judicial authorities in one Member State have in the legal systems of all the other Member States .
I am not perhaps as much in favour as some of my fellow MEPs of Parliament &apos;s approving all the directors in turn , for we should then be attaching too much importance to the agencies .
However , I thank those of you who have stayed .
I also believe that use , rather than ownership , should be taxed in the first place .
In conclusion , the future for our single market must lie in a car taxation system which is visibly CO2 modulated , but without central prescription .
In the European Union , we have previous experience of a situation in which an industry saw its employment dwindle , namely in agriculture , an example with which you , Commissioner , are very familiar .
As regards the European Works Councils Directive , I can explain it to anyone , as I was its originator .
This has to do with the European employment strategy , in particular with the proposals for guidelines and recommendations relating to it .
Who manages daily life in international , European , national , regional and local assemblies ?
I am also of the opinion , however , that we ourselves must keep hammering on about gender equality and that we must keep a very close eye on it .
We must nevertheless remember that things could also be better in the current Member States , including my own country , Finland , although Finland can be considered one of the pioneers of equality between women and men .
Women are no longer expected to leave the most important decisions to men .
Setting up a temporary European Parliament committee on improving safety at sea is the commitment that will enable us to overcome the hostility of our colleagues on the right to any initiative that would help to determine the causes of the major disaster that resulted from the shipwreck of the and to determine who was responsible .
Colleagues , as you will be aware , on Saturday 15 November 2003 , 15 people died and 28 were injured after the collapse of a gangway on the new cruise ship , in the French shipyard of Saint @-@ Nazaire .
This is apparently so that the police can control their content .
Today , a large number of countries have still not adopted the draft directive on equal treatment for people subject to discrimination .
Despite the fact that a large proportion of the policy for the disabled - particularly its medical component - is national policy , it is , however , the case that employment policy , social exclusion policy and internal market policy are of key importance to people with disabilities .
They want to see action after 2003 , not merely more words .
Research on both types of cells is necessary , in particular because their properties are different , as moreover are the medical applications envisaged .
Our function must surely be to take up an independent position rather than being a mere extension of the Commission , and so I would like to take this opportunity of expressing warm thanks to Mr Liese .
We must persuade the Council of Ministers to do likewise .
- Mr President , given the way that society is currently organised , where economic decisions are determined by profit , I do not trust the way in which industrial groups use scientific discoveries .
Most of the stem cell lines listed in the NIH register come from Sweden . I once took the trouble to consult the people who manufactured them .
Its budget has doubled over the past five years , and , in 2004 , it will be getting another billion dollars , itself equivalent to over two @-@ thirds of the budget of the German Research Foundation .
On the other hand , however , there are also extremely dangerous points in keeping with the more general policy of commercialising everything . They include the reference to competition @-@ orientated research in paragraph 5 , the approach to intellectual property rights from the point of view of the commercial interests of private undertakings in paragraph 26 and public intervention for market @-@ orientated research and financing which abides by the rules of competition of the European Union in paragraph 32 .
The IDA programme is more complicated .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to join other Members in expressing my approval , not only of the three reports we are discussing here but also of the Commission &apos;s proposals .
Can we have the operators pay for these reforms in the infrastructure ?
As it is not possible to adopt such a comprehensive approach now , and as this directive fixes the level of fuel taxes for quite a long time , a decision seems unlikely .
I would like to once again stress to my fellow Members that the Commission made an extremely progressive proposal , which can be expected to have an impact in 2010 @-@ 2012 for the candidate countries .
It goes against the distortion of the internal market as it has to in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty .
The plan is based on the fundamental principles of the reform , and the key points include the functional independence of OLAF , the new Financial Regulation , which came into force in January 2003 , the new Staff Regulations , the provisions concerning rights and obligations and the codes of conduct .
I therefore feel that I must stress at this point that the sooner the Annual Policy Strategy is presented , the more fruitful this exercise is likely to be .
I believe this must be emphasised , because new instruments are being introduced whilst overlooking the crucial role played by the European Parliament .
President Prodi , that is not good enough !
We take note of the extraordinary progress that they have made , but we attach great importance to their respecting the and applying the texts relating to controls at the new external border .
It is therefore an institution which has a watchdog role and which cannot afford to be associated with even the remotest doubt or suspicion regarding its impartiality or authority of the kind currently surrounding it .
A way must be found to restore the harmonious balance between Parliament and the Commission .
Although the Commission has not taken account of all the requests made by the parliamentary committees , experience shows that the reliability of the timetables could be further improved .
Mr President , I would like to focus on the issue of culture , and I welcome the Commission &apos;s endeavours in the field of education , youth and culture , also for 2003 . For 2004 , you list a work programme with seven proposals of interest to the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport .
With the Stability and Growth Pact in mind , I demand that you insist on compliance with the law .
This will be decided by OLAF .
The vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs was clear : we rejected the proposal by a crushing majority and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs therefore proposes rejection of the Commission proposal .
In fact , the report itself is obliged to note that private companies , being essentially concerned with profit , indeed with short @-@ term profits , are neglecting to invest in research .
Application is extended to include all other passenger ships on domestic routes .
These events will certainly lead us to provide ourselves with regulations ranging from prevention to sanctions .
Which states have progressed , and which are dragging their heels ?
This compromise does not mean a complete liberalisation of port services , as I have heard throughout the previous debate .
During conciliation , the parliamentary delegation initially appeared determined to persist in the view previously adopted by Parliament .
This push for liberalisation is currently presenting more risks than benefits in our ports .
I am convinced that competition between ports demands the continuation of a purpose @-@ built framework and of certain rules , not least for the sake of the workers and of our environment .
It is just unfortunate that it was not just that little bit more , then I , too , could have reconciled myself with the text .
Other companies , on the other hand , employ third @-@ party service providers .
Meanwhile , the current presidency hosted an experts &apos; seminar in Rome on 13 and 14 October which further explored the European Council &apos;s mandate , focusing in particular on resettlement and protected entry procedures .
In the plenary debate of 4 September on the &apos; Application of the EC @-@ Israel Association Agreement &quot; the Commission was asked why it had not notified the Member States that Israel &apos;s definition of territoriality is illegal .
We would like to see that happen during the Irish presidency and we would like to see the Commission come on board too .
The Commission will take any step it considers appropriate following a detailed analysis of the situation .
I am also worried about the welfare of vulnerable sea areas and the environmental risks they face .
That is something that we have already discussed here in connection with the Legislative Council .
They call for genuine changes , and it is on this basis that large numbers of the public demonstrate their sympathy .
As regards expenditure , and this is the small step forward that we have identified , in accordance with the Convention &apos;s draft the final decision is to be taken by Parliament .
There is no will to shape things in the Intergovernmental Conference , but rather a blocking mentality , and that cannot continue if we are to achieve a good result in December .
They must step up their fight to defend and broaden their rights and demolish the structure being constructed by the exploiters in order to finally change society .
A further consequence is that the potential for cooperation cannot be fully exploited . We have of course already seen this with the resources that we enter in the budget for the Barcelona Process and the MEDA Programme , which remain unutilised .

I also think it very important to support the &apos; Agora &quot; website , thereby developing a virtual forum in which legislators at national and European level can consult each other .
Quite a lot has already been said about the first matter . I wish , in any case , to make a general remark , however , namely that it is striking that the women &apos;s programme is the shortest one .
I also wonder , by the way , about the Association of the Councils of State and Supreme Administrative Jurisdictions of the European Union .
And therefore , defending and supporting each and every women &apos;s organisation which works for equality , we must not treat those which are not equal equally .
. Mr President , I would like to respond briefly to this joint debate in order , firstly to thank Members , rapporteurs and other participants in the discussions this morning and also to express appreciation for all the work that has been put into the issues covered by this joint debate .
- We broadly agree with the criticism made of the proposal for a European Parliament recommendation on SIS II as to its effects on safeguards for citizens &quot; fundamental rights ( protection of data and privacy ) and to the growing use of the SIS as a tool for police cooperation , in an increasingly supranational context without any proper checks .
The principle of subsidiarity is important to us . We want to see a limited and efficient EU dealing with cross @-@ border problems .
Rather than opening the borders between EU countries slightly only to close them even tighter on the outside , Europe must be an open Europe that shares its resources with the peoples of these countries , which it pillaged , colonised and exploited for so long .
Certainly , international terrorism and other worldwide crime constitute an extensive threat to the Western democracies and to human dignity .
Mr President , Mr Kinnock , I would like to thank you for being here to reply to this question and you will agree with me that certain measures have the virtue of inspiring unanimity , even if , as in this case , the unanimity is in favour of rejection .
All that remains is to implement it .
The whole experience has been a real lesson in the handling of the transitional requirement that arises automatically when we are making very necessary but quite sudden changes in our management and financing relationships .
Today , the parliament has resumed its activities and the President is negotiating with her Prime Minister , which is why I feel that we must seize this opportunity .
The tragedy in East Timor does not appear to have served as an example for the Government in view of the demands for autonomy that are coming from Borneo , the Moluccas , Atjeh and Papua .
The Buddhist patriarch is under house arrest and , what is worse , the pagodas belonging to the Buddhist church have been locked up , in a blatant attack on the most important principle of the Buddhist church .
On these grounds , with the greatest respect and with regret to my colleague , Mr Gargani , I ask that this matter be deferred until the next Strasbourg sitting .
Precisely in order to facilitate these efforts , however , it will be necessary , in the Presidency &apos;s view , for the Heads of State or Government to provide clear directions on the next legs of the journey , confirming , therefore , the deadlines : 2004 for the conclusion of the negotiations , 2005 for the signing of the Accession Treaties and 2007 for accession to the European Union .
The real challenge facing us is how to solve this problem .
I should also like to call for the Council meeting to express its support for the Geneva Initiative for peace in the Middle East , under which a number of courageous Palestinians and Israelis have now signed an agreement that may succeed in breaking down walls .
In his excellent speech , which we all applauded with pleasure , Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit stated that he did not want to die for Denmark , Europe or America nor from any illness .
It was , &apos; this is better than nothing . &quot;
We believe it significantly alters the balance of power between Member States and the European Union institutions .
People deserve better than a watered @-@ down compromise seasoned with national interests .
It is equally true , however , that certain sections of this House , and local employers &apos; organisations outside it , are increasingly calling for ever more stringent , narrowly @-@ drawn business impact assessments as a way of blocking the Commission &apos;s right of initiative on much @-@ needed proposals .
In essence , first in the work carried out during October and November , subsequently within the Eurogroup and , lastly , within Ecofin , a broad consensus has been achieved on the substance of the recommendations formulated by the Commission and on the substance of the adjustments introduced by France and Germany .
Now that we have monetary union , we ought to revise the Pact to include the new elements .
I believe that this is to be done by people who , rather than being the guardians of rules , want to be politicians , which is what Plato once meant when he talked about the politician and his supremacy .
Of course , the Commission said it would continue to apply the Treaty and that it reserves the right to look at the consequences of the Council conclusions and to decide on any action it might take .
We can see how , in practice , there are quite different rules for large countries such as Germany and France and for small countries such as Portugal and Ireland .
Of course , the way the big boys play the game within the European Union has a seriously prejudicial effect on the accession countries , who , as we are aware , will , all ten of them , followed by another two , be signing up to the euro , and all the while we have had one debate after another about the need to keep to the criteria .
However , he has appealed against the original sentence , and now , along with others involved in the original affray , is awaiting the start of a retrial .
This is , one might think , rather a mouthful for what is essentially a simple idea .
I hope I will be able to respond to a number of the points he made in his opening remarks .
OLAF has a difficult transitional period behind it .
It was not until Parliament became vociferous on the subject that the investigations picked up speed .
The next item is the debate on the report ( A5 @-@ 0407 / 2003 ) by Mrs Miguélez Ramos , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2561 / 2001 aiming to promote the conversion of fishing vessels and of fishermen that were , up to 1999 , dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco ( COM ( 2003 ) 437 C5 @-@ 0357 / 2003 2003 / 0157 ( CNS ) ) .
We are very keen to ensure that development policy is not ghettoised into one little bit of the Commission , and that its objectives are mainstreamed right across EU policies when we are dealing with the developing world .
In resolving the restrictions to the provision of funeral services the Commission will do its utmost to make Member States aware of the very important problems raised in this report regarding differing provisions on autopsies and death certificates .
The environmental and human health benefits of the tighter sulphur limit would still outweigh the costs but the overall cost to the shipping industry would double to over EUR 2 billion .
We still have a long way to go before we reach that point .
The Commission sees no reason why it should make a proposal , and that is exactly why unanimity in the Council does not work .
One notable exception to this is the SAPARD programme for rural development in applicant countries .
The Commission has committed itself to the objective of doing so ; far from being discouraged by setbacks , we will redouble our efforts , and the Court of Auditors gives us fresh courage as we pursue this goal .
We could fulfil all of the EU &apos;s tasks with 10 % of the budget , whereupon we should only have 10 % of the fraud we see today .
There is also an account of previous observations , proposed observations and of the Commission &apos;s responses .
The House will be aware that the Court has never favoured references to the rate of error .
Quite simply , to return to the Spanish Presidency and its slogan , this card will provide us with &apos; more Europe . &quot;
These adjustments will help to speed up the implementation of the policy of the European Union , of the capitalist reforms in the Members States , on the pretext of harmonising health systems , by which we mean levelling social benefits downwards , abolishing the public nature and privatising and commercialising the health and social security systems , reducing pensions and increasing workers &quot; contributions to insurance funds .

Without running the risk of falling into a utopian programme , I believe we could go a little further , along the lines of what the rapporteur proposes , towards drawing up a bolder plan .
In spite of constructive efforts , current fisheries policy still means that the EU is buying itself the right to misuse the natural resources of the poor .
This gives countries equal opportunities as regards time , with none having more rights than any other .
Given the relatively low attendance in this House on Thursdays - I make no comment about why that is - it is quite unacceptable for a major codecision text of this kind to be taken on a Thursday .
It is good to draw attention to this rule , especially at a time when Europe in general , and Parliament in particular , is criticised for meddling in everything .
The compromise package will ensure that the increasing number of patients in Europe who are treated with human tissues and cells can trust that these substances are not only safe but also of good quality .
I too would , therefore , like to thank the rapporteur Mr Liese , since once is not the norm here , who undoubtedly played a very positive role in drafting these compromise amendments .
The debate is closed .
That is made clear by three amendments that have now been re @-@ tabled : Amendments Nos 35 , 36 and 37 , and by other amendments that have been tabled by the Verts / ALE and GUE / NGL Groups .
Subject to Member States &quot; law being preserved , in particular by Article 5 , we will vote in favour of the new draft regulation .
Furthermore , this directive does not say anything at all about the specific control that the European Commission exercises over mergers that are likely to lead to misuse of a dominant position , control which , strangely enough , is still opposed to this type of merger when a European company has the dominant position , but much less so when a company from outside Europe has this position .
Private operators are more attractive to VAT @-@ registered companies , although the overall price may be higher , as the customer can reclaim the VAT , which generally results in a lower net cost to the business .
I could have done so earlier but she did not ask for it and therefore I did not think it was necessary to reply .
Having said this , it is clear to me that Member States should have the possibility to develop financial assurance solutions at their own pace which are well adapted to their own needs and institutional conditions .
I will mention them in no particular order .
With regard to the reparation measures , we must allow the Member States to be able to cover the damage created , as reparation measures , as laid down in Amendments Nos 10 , 11 and 12 approved by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
I am well aware that this proposal is complex and sensitive .
These were the points I made on behalf of this House to the IGC .
In this connection , the Council has invited the Commission to look into the matter and put forward solutions .
Sharing the blame is not enough , however , ladies and gentlemen .
I would like to underline the extent of the concern felt by Liberal Democrats and Reformers in this House and beyond and our feeling that the actions of the larger Member States are plunging the European Union into a crisis which could endanger the democratic nature of our Union .
Sweden said at the end of the IGC that it is a matter that could probably not come back before the Council until 2005 , and others have talked about it not coming back for at least two years .
But if you look things calmly in the face , you will see that the cause of this fiasco is not the Italian Presidency , whose excellent work I commend in passing , nor the attitude of some Member States , who have courageously defended their national interests as their peoples demanded , but quite simply our Convention and its incredible draft constitution .
The IGC has simply unmasked the lie of the Convention .
That is why we reached an outcome that ought to have been validated by the Heads of State or Government .
I trust that the Italian Presidency &apos;s proposal that the Council should have the facility to amend the statute of the European Central Bank by a qualified majority will be accepted and I hope that the statute of the European Central Bank will soon be amended along the lines you indicated , so that the European Central Bank can finally start to encourage investments , especially public @-@ sector investments , instead of trying to strangle them at every step , as if they were illegitimate children .
Furthermore , assurances are still required in relation to the protection of Scotland &apos;s offshore oil and gas reserves and the need to ensure that control and licensing powers are not conferred upon the EU .
In brief , they are asking tobacco producers to uproot and to pay for the privilege .
I am glad that , thanks to the negotiations involving the Council and our rapporteur Mr Lehne , the adoption of this important text is now , at last , within our reach .
That concludes the explications of vote .
We need to fast @-@ track , to improve quality of spending and to focus more on our core areas and secure greater rationalisation of our processes .
I say that because I was a coordinator for five years , I have been a chairman for four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years and I know which is the harder job it is not this one .
Thanks also to the Directorate @-@ General , now skilfully led by Mr Romero , and those who worked with it .
This year , we have formed relatively few reserves .
EU Member States often tend to make big promises , but then forget them when it comes to putting their money where their mouths are .
As for Parliament &apos;s role , I think it has shown more rigour , more European spirit in the work carried out to establish a budget .
The debate is closed .
We could spend a long time discussing the type of abortion we are referring to - spontaneous abortion or induced abortion . I really do not feel able , personally , to give a detailed answer to a question framed in this way .
The importance of the admission of citizens of third countries for temporaral or seasonal work is fully recognised by the Union .
In the meantime , the interim President , Mrs Burjanadze came to Brussels to meet the High Representative , Mr Solana , and the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi .
The European Medicines Agency in London will guarantee , through the structures and working methods envisaged in this legislation , that scientific resources are coordinated effectively , thus safeguarding the high standards of the evaluations .
First , the data protection scheme and generic competition .
When effective alternatives exist , however , they should be promoted .
Sometimes , improvements can also be achieved through studies on existing substances .
I have two specific questions on this , which I would like you to answer , Commissioner .
In my opinion that is not what Europe is all about .
Permanent derogations are exceptional .
The proposal aimed at guaranteeing a high level of health protection for European patients using traditional herbal products .
Garlic is an extremely potent medicinal remedy ; it is also a food in wide circulation .
The proposal in question based on the new approach replaces some 11 existing old @-@ approach directives which allow for national legislation to exist alongside Community provisions and are technically outdated .
As regards the principle of the single salary , we are convinced that it represents a principle of democracy and equal treatment .
He has paid compliments to other colleagues , so let me pay a very warm compliment to him .
If that should happen , we look forward to working with you on that urgent matter .
This is the key to bringing peace , as is the need to put in place humanitarian assistance , protection for civilians and so on .
Moreover , it should also be pointed out that Beijing has rejected the idea of making the lifting of the embargo dependent on tangible progress in human rights .
Therefore , we do not want to do anything to further escalate the tensions in this region .
Mr President , thank you for having given me the floor now because , in actual fact , the three reports on which we are to vote constitute a package .
I was first elected to this Parliament in 1994 .
The &apos; 8 + 2 + 1 &quot; compromise involves eight years &quot; dossier protection , plus two years for generic medicinal products , to put the dossier in order , followed by market access , and then one year &apos;s extra protection for the innovative industry if a medicinal product also has a therapeutic effect for other illnesses ; and results in greater price competition , an improved supply of medicinal products and a boost to the knowledge @-@ based economy .
If the truth be told , we could expect nothing else from the political forces that decide , in the EP , in the Commission and in the various governments , on EU policies .
The European electronic road toll service we are proposing , like the interoperability of systems , responds to genuine need for users , in particular lorry drivers , who want an electronic means of payment as soon as possible , a single one for the whole of the network .
Advocates of a toll system , at any rate , know how important tolls can be in regulating traffic flow and diverting traffic from overstretched or environmentally vulnerable areas to other routes .
If we are then required to move to some kind of satellite system , that really would cause enormous problems , because satellite systems are not designed for urban environments and there would be difficulties of visibility - of actually seeing traffic in the way that is required .
The views of the two institutions moved closer together during the conciliation procedure .
You are turning an environmental conflict , an ecological disaster , into a legal conflict that is unique in history .
Because we were faced with the task of finding a solution for a country that has not itself played a constructive part in the process .
I personally was in favour , including during the conciliation procedure , and I shall also vote in favour of the result of the agreement with the Council tomorrow , because I think that , without damaging the airlines , it provides a good framework within which to protect the consumer , the passenger .
With regard to interlining , I would say that if a British Airways flight from Tokyo arrives at Helsinki and Finnair goes on from there to Oulu and this onward flight is cancelled due to bad weather , it is unfair if Finnair has to pay the whole cost of the ticket .
It goes without saying that in its cooperation with Turkey the Commission presses for full compliance with all agreements and provisions relating to the fight against drugs .
We must work on an extremely broad front .
- Mrs Zorba , let me start by saying that no state in the world other than Turkey recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus , and I have no plans to change the situation .
The Commission is monitoring noise problems , however , and their impact on citizens living close to airports .
In particular , when assessing the number of jobs involved in the passenger and ferry services and cruise activities , the cabin crew and catering personnel have been taken into account as part of the crew . &apos; 
I think it is a good thing that we have avoided a conciliation procedure .
This will ensure the continuity of the budget line until the end of 2006 when the new financial perspectives will be established .
I sincerely hope this is still a reality .
We all know this as well .
But the reality is that both the Commission and the Council are male @-@ dominated .
Back then we were discussing the regulation on genetically modified food and feed . I was the rapporteur , and we had to battle with the Commission and certain Member States in order to secure the flexibility in the form of Article 26a .
He mentioned organic farming .
I would have preferred to see more of a social component in them , and I back anything that can improve the situation in the African countries in relation to fisheries agreements .
At the concluding session at the beginning of last week , agreement was reached on a report containing 19 recommendations for action on a variety of issues , including the exchange of information and best practice .
Allow me to tell a personal story .
As spokesman for my Conservative delegation on research , I share the view of Ms Lynne that we should like to see chronic diseases more strongly prioritised in the EU &apos;s framework research programmes .
An interminable number of international summits have now taken place at which we have given pledges concerning , for example , education for all and the fast track initiative within the World Bank to help children and , above all , girls to benefit from an education .
This is especially gratifying given that in other areas - let me cite some examples from my sphere of interest : the Alpine Convention - has mystifyingly absolved itself of much of its responsibility and has thus contributed to the stasis and paralysis of this initiative .
We have concluded this second reading of the Draft Budget for 2004 , which is a historically important year since it covers the enlargement of the European Union to 25 countries .
The alarming conclusions of this hearing led to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development appointing Mr Souchet and myself as co @-@ rapporteurs of this own @-@ initiative resolution .
The solutions indicated as regards the system of financial compensation in the event of overbooking / flight cancellation , reimbursement for delays , the system of carrier liability and passenger assistance in the event of flight cancellations are satisfactory and protect the various interests involved , particularly those of passengers .
.
For the umpteenth time , they congratulate the Turkish Government on its &apos; reforms &apos; and repeat the wish list for the Cyprus problem to be resolved , without daring to close the accession door to Turkey if it is not .
The mid @-@ term review provides the opportunity to again put the emphasis on prevention or repair .
There is even a solidarity principle in Article 2 of the treaty .
We also know , however , that many people &apos;s perspective is determined primarily by their economic situation , and that the confidence in parliamentary democracy - and that confidence is not so great in Georgia as it is - melts away if there is no improvement in the economic situation .
The joint debate is closed .
Mr President , I do apologise , but I would ask you to ring very loudly , for most Members of the House are assuming that the vote will take place in an hour &apos;s time at the earliest , and it will take some time for them to get here .
Could I take the opportunity to thank colleagues for their solidarity and support .
It is little wonder that many Scots have now completely lost faith in the CFP .
Mr President , I will end by saying that what has happened recently demonstrates , firstly , that safety is a central aspect of air transport , and it is essential that we continue to ensure that it is maintained and strengthened .
Mr President , Commissioner , I have listened most attentively to your statement on air safety in a context that is particularly difficult for France after the Sharm el @-@ Sheikh disaster and I have heard your concerns .
We cannot afford , in either financial or human terms , to make room for woolly interpretations by one side or the other .
The problem is , however , that Member States flout the rules to which they have committed themselves in treaties .
We have a saying in Dutch to the effect that many small ones make a big one , by which token many small incidents of pollution are , in time , as important as a major disaster .
This is the burning question when the director of the Maltese maritime authority , which was responsible for the registration of the , is ordered by his government to refuse to answer the summons of the judge investigating the case and when the authorities in the Bahamas are showing the most obvious lack of good will by constantly delaying publication of their report on the disaster , a ship that was flying their flag .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that the Commissioner and we as Parliament are right to claim responsibility for a measure adopted in this parliamentary term that is finally effective in the area of safety at sea .
Consequently we accept them all , notably Amendments 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 , 20 and 23 .
We have to maintain our commitments .
In particular , he proposes an essential change .
I am opposed to nuclear energy and opposed to the nuclear package .
I challenge the honourable Members to come up with any .
We all know that Euratom loans support the nuclear industry in a way that distorts competition ; with their more favourable interest rates and their high political risks covered , nowhere in the whole of the energy sector is any other form of investment even comparable .
The Convention recognises our right to do so , having inserted a new article to that effect in the draft Constitutional Treaty , and the prevailing situation demands that we do so .
Although our different views on policy made working together difficult , we managed together to get the report underway .
I do not see any need for granting the Commission new powers in this area , therefore .
They are meant to provide services where the market alone cannot do so on a universal basis , at a reasonable price , or , in many instances , free of charge .
We also deplore the fact that no discussion has taken place on the consequences that will ensue from the thoroughgoing changes proposed in the draft European Constitution , specifically the end to the pillar structure , the introduction of a hierarchy of legislation and the explicit provision made for judicial supervision of agencies &quot; acts .
The reason for this is quite simply that we want to start with what is immediately feasible and it seems to us that if we had to work initially on streamlining the existing agencies with their very disparate characteristics , it would have been difficult , if not impossible , to adopt a truly uniform approach .
We must fulfil our development promises : stop the agricultural subsidies that have shot up and instead use them for the environment , consumers , and agriculture that is beneficial to the developing world .
One only has to look at the budgets of the European Union : we are continuing to spend 40 % of the Union budget on subsidising and protecting rich farmers , who represent a declining sector in the European economy .
Tuna fishing is one of the types of fishing worst affected by these illegal practices .
From a strictly legal perspective , however , I believe that this situation is far from simple , given that the proposed Directive is based on Article 80 relating to transport , although it also a matter of defining a crime .
I therefore voted in favour .
As I have advocated on many occasions , the terms of the regulation and implementation of EU legislation ( and operating rules of EU institutions ) need to be as clearly worded as possible .
Furthermore , we have other third countries , such as the United States , which is the world &apos;s largest exporter of cotton , or China , which dominates the market by being the world &apos;s main producer , the main consumer of industrial cotton and the main exporter of textiles .
On the contrary , the people of the South are organising themselves and resisting European ambitions and the WTO .
One of the options that the Commission needs to look at most earnestly is the proper management of the trade , which would involve extensive and , unfortunately , expensive , surveys of animal populations , control of selective killing and , as far as the export trade is concerned , proper regulation for public health .
What people have said in this debate is quite correct : ebola is one threat and there are many other very difficult aspects of this trade which require considerable attention .
In building close relations between the Union and Iran - which has a population of over 70 million people - it is best to build on the basis of dialogue and consultation rather than on the basis of political assumption , political prejudice and political coercion .
In your resolution , you call for a study on the state of tuna resources .
However , fresh tuna has become more popular and is readily available to consumers in my country , Scotland .
Our question is this : would it not be possible to produce some kind of recommendation on how contracts should be concluded with these homes ?
I would ask you to look particularly at the problem of neonates and infants , who are being fed milk formula from reconstituted , fluoridated tap water .
The Commission confirms that no Community aid is now available for investment in greyhound rearing or racing .
The diagnosis is not under discussion ; what we are discussing now is the therapy required .
The association agreement should be seen as a framework for a long @-@ term engagement with Syria in this respect .
Thank you for this decision .
I think this is the right approach , because it means that countries wishing to take this further will not now be prevented from doing so ; nor will they actually have to turn the clock back . Instead , they can retain their current successful standards .
Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur and all the parties involved in the proposal tabled .
I agree with the choice of wording put forward by Mrs Sandbæk .
This , as the report says , is where the EU , the Commission and this Parliament have to redouble their efforts .
Madam President , I agree with most of what has been said tonight .
I will dwell a little on the establishment of the peace facility .
Unfortunately , many of Zimbabwe &apos;s neighbours not only have encouraged the Mugabe regime , but also have allowed Mugabe to dictate the terms of Africa &apos;s relationship with us .
What we are demanding is that there should be no more forced liberalisation in this area .
I would like to reiterate this call today .
The wealth of Europe - and what differentiates us from other regions of the world , as the Commissioner has said - undoubtedly lies in our cultural diversity , and we must try to export that model .
Security has been maintained and not only has the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro been formed , but it has also become a member of the Council of Europe and an equal participant in the European integration processes .
I fully understand the importance Parliament attaches to bringing the constitutional project to a successful and early conclusion .
As a presidency , we will also progress work on the Union &apos;s crisis management capabilities .
I therefore agree with the proposals made by the Irish Presidency to concentrate Union measures on humanitarian aid , respect for human rights and on the political , economic and social factors that fuel war and violence .
In this regard , I would like to say , Mr President , that we naturally support the proposals from the Commission which at least maintain the current effort .
- Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , we have to ask ourselves a very simple question : is Europe as a whole sustainable ?
Indeed , I am of the view that the transatlantic relationship has not yet adapted fully to the new set of circumstances which exist following the collapse of the Iron Curtain , the effective removal of a security threat to Europe from the East and the emergence of the United States as the world &apos;s only superpower .
Europe must advance with social progress hand in hand with economic progress .
I would in any case like to ask the Taoiseach , in the light of the collapse of the talks , to answer one very specific question .
Because of the failure to establish agreement on the new European Constitution during the previous presidency , their first main task is to reach that agreement .
We should in any event get away from back @-@ room decisions taken in the middle of the night .
I am asking because Parliament has so far been asking the Council about this in vain .
I am sure that , in your new garb as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you will be able to further these measures and bring them to a conclusion , because they are in the interests of the European public and our fellow citizens are awaiting them .
We must now try to complete the process .
I am well aware that making decisions like this one has its consequences .
These include the fact that the aims for the strategy have yet to be defined in measurable terms and that the annual reports do not manage to combine addressing the political aims that I have highlighted and a thorough analysis and evaluation of the current situation .
I accept that .

The directive is important irrespective of its individual contents .
They would then have to work in a Member State for two years before they can access Europe .
I would also like to congratulate Mr Zappalà on the work he has done , on having to endure the enormous number of amendments , and also on his speech in plenary , which has clarified things .
Lastly , I should also like to congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on her birthday next week .
I turn to the report by Mr Purvis .
The Commission has founded its proposal on Article 95 because it strongly believes that this measure ought to be adopted under the codecision procedure .
We regret that the report makes no distinction between those areas of immigration to be handled at European level and those to be handled at national level .
A group of experts has been set up by the Commission , made up of officials from the Member States , with the aim of finding solutions to problems that have arisen .
Consequently , the internal market cannot be complete unless the management of copyright and related rights is addressed .
As Commissioner Bolkestein said , these are monopolies , but they are in principle benign monopolies because of the territoriality of copyright .
I recently asked the Commission about this matter and I was satisfied with the answer Commissioner Nielson gave .
This sort of support was specifically excluded from the measures taken against Zimbabwe in order to protect the population and to promote progress .
. Mr President , the Commission joins in the strong condemnation of the brutal murder last month of Archbishop Michael Courtney , and expresses its deep sympathy to his family and to the Holy See .
We call upon the Haitian Government , the opposition and civil society to engage in a constructive dialogue , possibly in the framework of a national conference to pave the way for free and fair legislative elections .
In due course it will be our duty to seek national ratification , in some cases through referenda .
We have confidence in you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , in your government , in your Taoiseach , in the President of the European Council , in your foreign minister , in you personally and in Commissioner Barnier too - that is all I want to say about the Commission today - and , if we take this path together ...
We are all looking forward to ten countries acceding to the Union on 1 May 2004 .
In spite of the Intergovernmental Conference , the draft Constitution produced by the Convention is still on the table , amongst other things because of the impetus given by this House and words such as those spoken by its President , Mr Cox , last Monday in Madrid , demanding that the IGC finish its work and finish it properly , in time - in other words - for the European elections and - why not ? - before the end of this legislature .
The following are the two main aspects of the new system : abolishing the notification system in respect of agreements between undertakings and establishing uniform conditions under which undertakings are to operate in the context of the common market .
My analysis , as Parliament &apos;s rapporteur on the electricity market , is that today in the European Union we do not have the relevant instruments to cope .
Initial trends indicate greater price convergence and we believe the process is fully under control .
We have a clear aim , which is increased integration in European airspace in the interests of the citizen .
The airspace blocks will be based on operational or functional requirements , irrespective of national borders , in consultation with Eurocontrol .
The result is satisfactory .
I refer to the rescue and aid services that are to be implemented .
- Report ( A5 @-@ 0008 / 2004 ) by Stefano Zappalà , on behalf of Parliament &apos;s Delegation to the Conciliation Committee , on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water , energy , transport and postal service sectors ( PE @-@ CONS 3695 / 03 C5 @-@ 0608 / 2003 2000 / 0117 ( COD ) ) .
As we all know , the issue of the social and environmental criteria has been much to the fore in this debate .
Having devoted most of my adult life to negotiating , I know that , in negotiations , a point must be reached at which the parties agree .
The waste problem does not need to become any greater than it is .
It went on to say that the efforts of the administration had been focused on discouraging or destabilising the messenger of the bad news , in this case the financial controller , rather than to change things for the benefit of the COR .
If this is not the case , the Commissioner must issue instructions so that improvements can be made .
The rapporteur , Mr Casaca , has worked hard to produce this painstaking report .
Personally , I am glad about it .
The problem is when and how to implement the measures detailed in the communication .
The neo @-@ liberal dogmas that had previously held back the EU , fearful of a de @-@ industrialised Europe , from adopting an industrial policy , are now obsolete .
We need the Commission to produce an annual report that will get Parliament discussing the political priorities in order to establish how to proceed , what we have achieved and what we have not achieved .
It is not enough , however .
The report also looks at the role that the EU should play within the UN .
These hopes were , however , dashed by the fact that the great powers often used their vetoes to block the UN &apos;s work .
Given the challenges to the multilateral system that Secretary @-@ General Annan has placed in the spotlight in such a determined way - including last Friday at the World Economic Forum in Davos - the central thrust of this report , which reaffirms support for a strong , reformed UN at the centre of the multilateral system , is very welcome .
For the report , a more effective UN means an enlarged Security Council , minor restrictions on the right to veto decisions and more means of intervention , including the military option .
This is something I naturally welcome .
Let the ten new countries in and let them find their feet first before we start rushing into further European integration .
As I remarked , we are also joined today by a number of those who survived that vicious assault : Ms Nada Al @-@ Nashif , Mrs Mona Rishmawi and Professor Gil Loescher , you are also very welcome here today .
The vast majority of immigrants are industrious , courageous and determined .
Now , as we offer you our heartfelt gratitude , we remember Sérgio Vieira de Mello and the many who were killed by a murderous terrorist act in Baghdad , we remember the many who have laid down their lives in the service of the United Nations , and , to those members of their families who are here today , we extend our sympathy and express our solidarity .
Secretary @-@ General , in this connection , before concluding , allow me to mention the issue of the appointment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights .
It is unfortunate that the PSE Group did not support us on this .
They have created friction , especially in Germany .
In a slightly shock reversal of the normal roles within the PPE @-@ DE Group , I found that the rest of my Group were more cautious about the idea of further regulation than I was : usually I am the one in my Group arguing for a more deregulatory approach .
Consequently , the Commission communication expressly concerns itself with the results of these judicial cases .
But workers in the UK are on low wages , even though we have a national minimum wage .
Had it been a derogation with a limited lifespan , nothing could have been said against it .
We are fighting together with the workers to overturn the current anti @-@ labour framework and flexible forms of employment .
This forum has provided the possibility for women &apos;s opinions to be heard and the possibility for mutual support .
That is far more the case in the developing countries and will remain so for longer , for they often totter on the brink of a catastrophe .
A poor country is often not equal to the financial power of a multinational whose budget is many times greater than that of that country itself .
In its sanitary and its economic dimension , not forgetting the animal welfare aspects , this outbreak of avian influenza is unprecedented and , although there is at present no indication of a developing human pandemic , this risk cannot be excluded according to the WHO .
The point is that this Parliament has given the Commission the opportunity of using this extra money twice in the past two years .
I believe Thailand should be completely delisted from all poultry meat exports until that country can prove it has the infrastructure and the integrity to apply EU standards all the time .
In relation to the FVO , I should say that I have not sent the FVO to Thailand in respect of this particular outbreak .

The epidemic of atypical pneumonia has confirmed the courage of those researchers and doctors who have risked their lives to alert the international community , and even if Europe has escaped relatively unscathed in this case , we must remain vigilant .
For the Europe of today , where millions of people cross national borders every day , we need to be in a position to take rapid , coordinated action at EU level to best protect the health of our citizens .
Here , in this House , we have done our bit ; it is now for the Member States to properly implement these conclusions and to do away once and for all with the unfair treatment of different types of farming , such as , for example , dairy cattle and arable farming . Let me quote you some figures .
A small farmer who failed to comply with one of a very large number of directives , including the Loiseau directive , would have his aids , and therefore his income , cut off .
We must apply a policy which secures farmers a decent income so that they can be master of their own land ; so that they have employment , prospects , a future , a productive horizon for their children .
With the Stevenson report now before us , Parliament urges the Commission to be more consistent in managing sustainable fisheries , and calls for a clarification of Community competences in the field of monitoring and inspection .
On behalf , too , of a Member here today , the MEP Mr Gobbo , I would like to mention the flight of 350.000 of our compatriots that were driven out of their countries and , above all , the sacrifice and the tragedy of the more than 10.000 people thrown - in many case when still alive - into caves and ditches in these countries : a tragedy affecting the Istrian , Giuliano @-@ Dalmatian and Fiumano peoples and which is still present in the lived experience and the suffering of these lands ; a tragedy that Europe too should remember and commemorate .
I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the work of the rapporteur .
Thriving rural areas are entirely dependent upon the existence of profitable farms .
I too agree that the complex research areas of food and food safety must be addressed in particular .
Cuts as proposed would have devastated the sector and caused widespread socio @-@ economic hardship .

My second comment is specifically to the Council .
Your communication , Mr President of the Commission , is rather sketchy when it comes to the choices that will have to be made to meet emerging needs .
We need to do this in all the areas before us .
Reform is therefore necessary , not to enable us to do everything nor to continue the &apos; sprinkling &quot; approach that we have adopted so far , but to enable us to meet the expectations of the public .
Budgetary discipline means the own resources ceiling , which is set at 1.24 % .
In the case of Wallonia - an Objective 1 region which is lagging behind the Community average - that is what justifies the support for aid , not whether or not there are cheap tickets .
It is reported that 260 of the 290 biological purification plants built are only partly operational or have been abandoned .
The results of this study will be made public in the spring , giving the Commission time to propose appropriate legislative measures in the framework of the future regulation applicable to the coming Structural Funds programming period .
Should such decisions not be taken with greater openness so that the factual arguments in favour of the location can be given greater weight ?
At the same time , action is being taken to intervene in an ongoing court case that could bring politically inconvenient facts to light .
Obviously , this will also include assessing whether or not Turkey is fully respecting human rights .
It is only by action at the EU level that we can take action against false food scares and bring reality to bear .
We should be talking about whether aquaculture itself is providing a viable and environmentally sustainable food for humans , and I would argue that the answer is increasingly looking like &apos; no &apos; .
We must find solutions in the form of industrial policies geared to protecting quality products , environmental conditions and employment in the iron and steel sector .
The second is the promotion of access to training for all workers , but especially elderly workers , and here we have set specific quantitative targets .
Dealing with 30 000 terrorists is not easy .
We need more cooperation in order to destroy drugs .
. - Madam President , as we all know , Afghanistan is a country with more problems than it has mountains and valleys .
Ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , you can be assured that the present report has prompted me to reflect on this a good deal .
However , it is imperative that security for women throughout the country is a priority for both donors and the Afghan Government .
We have to offer the rural population economically viable and steady means of earning an income .
I am also rapporteur on the two regulations dealing with the continuation of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights in 2005 and 2006 .
That is an important shift of emphasis and an important way of trying to use our development assistance and cooperation to promote political objectives which we all know are crucial , not only to the stability and wellbeing of societies , but also to their long @-@ term economic development .
I should also like to point out that raising the level of compensation can be no excuse for negligence in terms of prevention .
In this regard , only codecision would allow us to achieve a legitimate and viable compromise .
Mr Monti proposes that subsidies of less than EUR 15 million a year paid to businesses with an annual turnover of less than EUR 40 million should in future be the sole responsibility of the Member States .
I can only assume that , for reasons unknown to me , the Commission finds it embarrassing to answer this question .
Representatives of the two largest groups and of one of the other groups in this House recently paid separate visits to Iran .
The second offer , for another bilateral commission which would engage in a joint effort to combat terrorism , is one which , in my view , we should not refuse , likewise the offer made by the judiciary to cooperate with the Court of Human Rights here in Strasbourg in order to accelerate the training of Iranian judges in this field as well as simply to show them the advantages and disadvantages of the various systems .
I am in no doubt that what we are seeing at the moment is an attempt by the conservative clerics to distort the electoral process .
Parliament rightly continues to take an active interest in the affairs of Cambodia and I will ensure that this interest is reflected in what I say to Council and in the work of the Commission .
Mr President , I just wanted to draw the attention of the House to a major seminar that has been held in Dublin over the last two days on the subject of HIV / AIDS .
It is essential to remember that enlarging Europe both in terms of its territory and of its population will call for additional effort and greater coordination .
Issues such as moving forward with proposals concerning the interaction between industrial policy and other Community policies feature also .
The second axis - security - suggests that we should put in place border management and create a police force , in order to control migratory flows , in line with the interests of employers , and in so doing strengthen the trend towards security in the name of combating terrorism .
Parliament and the Council must focus on the adoption of the legislative package to promote competitiveness .
I do not think so .
Consequently , in order to discharge its responsibility , the Commission made a proposal presented to the House by Commissioner Barnier .
Mr President , in this magical world of the European Union , we never let reality intrude on our dreams , and from one summit to the next we go on regaling each other with fascinating fairy tales , such as the Lisbon Strategy or the European Constitution .
But where is the cash ?
Similarly , programmes seeking to modernise production processes must be stepped up , and it is essential that further investment is channelled into the research and development sectors .
It is absolutely vital to be far more active in promoting the efficient use of natural resources .
I do not believe the difficulty lies in the diagnosis . Rather , the difficulty lies in the implementation and practical application of what was decided in Lisbon .
In addition , during the Spring Summit , the Commission should indicate what has been done about removing superfluous legislation , of which , according to the Commission &apos;s promises to European industry , 25 % is to be deleted .
Municipal life , the concept of human dignity , of individual rights , of people &apos;s freedom , of the family is the principal social nucleus and of municipalities as the broadest framework of rights and co @-@ existence , solidarity , the concept of the State , they are all European concepts , as well as the concept of secularity . Furthermore , the very differences which make up what we so often call our cultural diversity demonstrate the wealth of interpretation and ways of living with a single common heritage .
I would like to thank the honourable Member once again for presenting such a thoughtful report and I am sure it will contribute to the outcome that we both wish to see .
But when , as we have seen in Chechnya , we find that 200.000 people have been killed in nine years , with tens of thousands of cases of torture and rape , that is no longer a human rights violation , it is genocide .
The organisation Journalists Without Frontiers has published a list in connection with press freedom on which , out of 158 countries , Russia is in 148th place . Moreover , the situation is getting worse .
That concludes the vote .
I can only urge all the committees to adopt projects in their own areas of responsibility - in accordance with the resolution in our report , a year ago , on gender mainstreaming - and to make it clear that mainstreaming gender equality is not just to be left to the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights .
If Mr Kronberger joins us , he will be on the right side .
Mr President , our only comfort is the knowledge that , for legal reasons , during the next legislature we will not have to listen to this type of comment so lacking in solidarity , which is contrary to Parliament &apos;s positions and which undervalues the rights of victims .
However , there is a basis for thinking that this percentage could be higher : 53 % , rising to 58 % by 2015 .
Six Member States set national targets to increase their childcare provisions .
Earlier today , we had a press conference in the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Equal Opportunities . I then heard that the number of people brought into the EU Member States for the purposes of sexual exploitation has now increased from 500.000 to 800.000 .
There is a clear link between , on the one hand , prostitution and every cruder pornography and , on the other hand , the oppression of women and violence towards them .
It is vitally important that the members of a family should have more of a choice as to whether to do the household chores and look after children themselves or to delegate them to others .
This gives us grounds for hope .
The action programme was well balanced and proved to be a solid basis for action , predominantly on account of the broad basis that was created at the conference .
Over the years the EU has been very good at creating free markets for goods and capital .
We are all familiar with the history of the issue : it is now the third time that we have discussed it .
It is production and can thus fall under this decision , since there is no type of guarantee that the aim is to combat trafficking , which is already amply punished in all of our laws .
This is severely disappointing .
To accept such a thing is in effect to exclude oneself from eligibility for European party funding .
The fact that the whole chain is to be included - right from the field to the shop , dining room and restaurant - is the principle that of course permeates the whole of the food safety legislation .
The fees issue was also hotly contested .
I believe that the essential elements to avoid deflection of trade are included in the proposal .
It is of course intended to have a deterrent effect on product pirates and counterfeiters .
I do not wish to comment on that now , I shall leave that to my colleague .
We have no need or means to interfere when it is a matter of copying by private citizens .
If , for example , the European Parliament cannot oppose the technocratic procedures for adopting decisions by means of small groups in the form of self @-@ regulation or co @-@ regulation , I do not know what role it can play .
Neither did the Commission , at first , propose adequate measures to combat these practices .
Negotiations leading to an arrangement of this type will certainly resolve this problem , which is actually a relatively minor one .
This approach is generating results ; duties are being recovered on goods from the settlements .
I voted in favour of this report , which proposes , without amendments , the approval of a Commission proposal intended to codify Council Decision 78 / 774 / EEC , concerning the activities of certain third countries in the field of cargo shipping .
I feel that the adoption of budgetary and legal initiatives must be based on a clear risk analysis demonstrating a genuine probability of terrorist attacks in the EU .
In effect , by imposing very high requirements for the formation of a European political party , the aim is to exclude new groups .
In particular , extending the regulations to include patents would be a mistake .
I wish to highlight two of these : the penalisation of all types of trafficking , production and sale of opium , cocaine and cannabis , and the condemnation of the production of synthetic drug precursors if they are produced with the aim of processing drugs .
They promised to direct their efforts to ensuring that these issues remained areas in which strictly national legislation applied , without the involvement of the EU .
It has been prepared in order to emphasise that , even in a just cause , there are some quite fundamental rules that have to be obeyed , namely respect for the individual person &apos;s rights , as laid down in the UN Convention on Human Rights and in the Geneva Conventions .
Nowadays , no one should be able to set themselves up at one and the same time as accuser , defender , judge and executioner - you might as well say torturer .
It is right and proper to condemn and continue to condemn the atrocity of 11 September 2001 and all other atrocities engineered by terrorists , whether in the United States or in Europe , in Spain , Ireland or indeed in Israel or the Palestinian territories .
What then is this new cliché about &apos; European Partnership &quot; ?
It is refusing to do so .
I wish to thank the rapporteurs , Ulpu Iivari , Doris Pack and Christa Prets for their excellent reports .
There will be no more rigid sectoral divisions like there are today , but rather the major emphases I have just described , with the three types of action we already know today : multiannual cooperation with private operators and businesses - an opening to the field of cultural businesses ; innovative annual projects , no change there ; and going back to the problems we have just solved , support for European cultural bodies .
Languages , Mr President , are included , as a common theme , in all our education programmes as well as in our programmes for citizenship .
Only after this decision has been taken will it be possible to start the recruitment procedures and look for staff , which process will take up a certain amount of time next year .
The least developed countries &apos;reference to flexibility in terms of quantity and negotiated quantitative restrictions could raise questions about compatibility with WTO rules if they were to be seen as a sort of voluntary limitation of exports .
Currently , the procedure is aimed at modifying the non @-@ implemented part of the project in the autonomous community of Castille and Leon .
I am aware that in a number of countries , including Namibia , South Africa , Botswana and Tanzania , carefully managed trophy hunting provides a major contribution to their relatively successful conservation efforts .
The trouble is that it is inevitably incomplete , given the time pressures within which we had to operate .
That is completely wrong and that is why we need strict limit values .
The Commission seems to be fully aware of this .
Previously , we Social Democrats have tried to start by decoupling production support by 50 % and shifting towards rural policy , nature conservation and animal welfare , in other words , shifting from quantity to quality .
The Commission has not taken into consideration the socio @-@ economic impact or the consequences for land @-@ use planning of the measures that it proposes .
I would conclude by calling on President Prodi , having taken note of Parliament &apos;s opinion , which we hope will be favourable tomorrow , to steer the forthcoming new mandate of the European Commission in this direction .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have listened attentively to the contributions to this debate , and I should like to express my sincere thanks for what was certainly a very lively , if in some areas highly critical , discussion .
We also have a greater understanding of where scope for compromise and possible agreements might lie .
This accords with democratic principles ; it is a fair solution ; it is not motivated by party @-@ political considerations but is a matter of principle .
At the present time we have two main problems . The first of these is that the Convention cannot defend its own draft and , with the Convention having completed its work , the European parliaments have lost the only place where they could coordinate their efforts and join forces to defend the parliamentary and democratic dimension of the constitutional provisions .
The sensible equation which seems to be commanding greater support is 55 @-@ 55 .
Having been at first a rather euphoric European , and having now become , after fifteen years in the European Parliament , a more realistic , more critical , not to say more uneasy one , I wanted to use my two minutes to shout , &apos; Look out !
So let us not play off the one against the other , but rather let us do what we have to do .
I have to say that I was heartened by it and I am very grateful to Members for their positive words and encouragement .
These are very much in the hands of the Bulgarian authorities , although we can help .
Last December , the European Council set out a very clear timeframe for the conclusion of negotiations in 2004 with both countries , subject of course to their individual state of readiness , with a view to their accession in January 2007 .
The alternative - and we must tell people that - would be continuing lack of freedom , the continuation of a totalitarian regime .
Indeed , what is evident from this discussion is that the main problems in the new Member States are not related to the fisheries chapter or the transport chapter , important and interesting though these may be .
We have therefore pushed for a number of general measures , covering all EU citizens , amending the definition of &apos; work &quot; to the effect that it must be sufficient to support the person concerned .
. The Daul report has received the consensus of Alleanza Nazionale , as an acceptable compromise has been reached between the various political groups of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , thanks to the work carried out by Mr Berlato to modify the Commission &apos;s original proposal .
Finally , I want to talk about the Czech parliament &apos;s intention of honouring the former Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš .
Already the next objective is to enter the eurozone , an objective that , some years ago , seemed difficult when inflation was rather high , but that now seems attainable within a reasonable time , given that , at the end of 2003 , inflation fell , settling at between 4 % and 5 % .
Forty per cent of the population still works in agriculture , and many farms rely on subsistence farming .
It is important that our family extends to Romania , a country that needs the European Union and that needs and , in certain sectors , also wants democracy despite the existing problems .
This is a question about the EU &apos;s credibility in the quest for peace .
A number of other issues were dealt with , but I want to return to one issue - the question of free movement and migration .
I would like to start , Madam Vice @-@ President , by reiterating that you have taken a very great deal of trouble in submitting a very well thought @-@ out proposal .
It is for that reason that we have to make it our concern that a start really is made on these projects , that they are brought to completion , and that funding should be provided for them .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must not hand out the motorways of the sea just to people we know , because that would be entirely contrary to our approach .
As I mentioned , the measures were symbolic and political in their nature and therefore the implementation concerns only governments and EU Member States .
The Council would like to stress once more that it has not set any specific date for decisions regarding the arms embargo on China .
Therefore , the Oslo agreement , which instead provides for autonomous Palestinian areas , is being rendered totally ineffective by Israel when the latter restricts the movement of foreign citizens too .
As with the Irish language , there has been a great interest in it and more people are speaking Scotch @-@ Irish today than have spoken it for many years .
Parliament was very keen to approve the Regulation at the earliest opportunity .
One might say that a majority in this House , drawn from every political group , is united in favouring the adoption of these practical rules for really safe air transport , so , on behalf of my own group , let me thank the rapporteurs and the Vice @-@ President .
First of all , I should like to extend warm thanks to Mr Miller for the good working relationship .
Mr Bolkestein is a frequent and always welcome visitor to Scotland .
The entry into force of the directive is postponed until 2007 .
This relationship has been developing ever since Israel &apos;s participation in the Fourth Framework Programme for research .
The debate is closed .
It is at this level that the debate must take place and at which all the interpretations are possible .
I should , nevertheless , like to make two crucial observations .
Mr Schmidt says that we have such different systems - which is true - but he also says that we could live with these different systems , that they do not affect freedom of movement and that we do not need these regulations .
Changes in the over 80 @-@ year olds age group will be greater and quicker than those in any other age group .
This cooperation should not be restricted to public health , the quantitative and preventive aspects , but should also pertain to the cost @-@ conscious and effective handling of provisions and the reinforcement of the financial basis for the health costs and the costs resulting from an ageing population .
In one candidate Member State , Romania , a large proportion of the population is now no longer insured , so they rely on the goodwill of doctors .
Today we are simply making a suggestion and a gesture which I believe to be appropriate .
This is indeed a strategy that will have a great impact on Europe in terms of both growth and employment , and one that should ensure great progress in terms of the continent &apos;s economy .
This entire issue and everyone involved are far removed from the real interests and needs of the workers and citizens of the various countries that make up the EU .
In other words , capitalism is welcomed and criticism is levelled at any reservations about the process of privatisation and at any obstacle to the greed of the current EU countries &quot; large @-@ scale capital in Bulgaria &apos;s strategic economic sectors .
Important steps in this field were also taken in the Bastos report on reconciling working life , family life and privacy , on which we have voted during this part @-@ session .
-Mr van den Bos , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , on Ukraine ( B5 @-@ 0135 / 2004 ) ;
Naturally , it is Ukraine which must choose its own form of government and its Constitution , in accordance with European democratic standards , but the circumstances and the way in which the debate on this reform is being carried out continue to cause concern .
The Commission regrets the climate of violence that has been created , the loss of human lives and many injured and urges the parties to apply the Declaration against Violence and for Peace and Democracy , which they themselves agreed .
We shall proceed to the vote on the motions for resolutions within the vote .
These more committed policies gave the European Union great visibility , ending the century with the negotiation of an association agreement with Mexico , which was a milestone in the European Union &apos;s policy .
The four regulations we have before us are an important part of the measures to improve food safety in the European Union .
This would be a pity , particularly having regard to the length of time - since July 2000 - that these proposals have been under consideration .
In the areas of poultry and rabbit production , there is clearly a demonstrable need for that and there is no serious problem of public health .
Transitional provisions should be put in place , though , for regions that have few slaughterhouses or special market problems .
Effective border controls on the transportation of animals are being made unlawful .
Looking ahead , we must ensure that the rules are properly implemented , that transport as meat increasingly becomes the norm , and that the rules are driven more by science than by emotion .
I hope that the majority of Parliament will show that it is considerations of animal welfare that are crucial in connection with the transports .
And what do I believe are the main reasons for this document ?
Mr President , as you will be aware , the debate on this report only concluded just before the vote .
.
In 2001 , an action programme on the mainstreaming of gender equality was adopted in Community development cooperation , which expires in 2006 .
On the one hand , I feel it was politically motivated rather than scientifically based .
The goal is to enjoy close and cooperative relations with all the countries of the region , responding as far as possible to initiatives from within the region itself .
They could have arrested him and tried him .
The least that can be asked is that we repeal and suspend the Association Agreement , just as the European Parliament has requested .
Both in Israel and among the Palestinians , there are forces pursuing mutual destruction .
What the Middle East needs is a broad democratic initiative for dialogue and cooperation between all countries in it , and Europe possesses the appropriate instruments to bring one about .
The drive and the initiative to address these challenges and to implement the necessary reforms must come from the region itself .
Before we arrived , he had decided to set up a reconstruction fund with an initial budget of EUR 5 million .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let us not beat about the bush .
To an increasing extent , threshold values are being determined by reference to what modern analysis can do rather than to the potential risk , and we should concentrate on the actual danger posed to the consumers .
That was not , however , the case .
First of all I would like to make a point about the legal base .
That is not ambitious enough , certainly not for a first reading , when we have so many negotiations yet to come .
It is important to bear in mind that this is a long @-@ term strategy .
Furthermore , such an instrument will help to improve the implementation of Community law , and hence further the effectiveness of Community environmental policy .
Certain amendments presented to plenary replace &apos; qualified entities &quot; with &apos; NGOs , &quot; but I do not believe that this resolves the issue ; I therefore propose that we follow the line approved in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , and which I proposed myself , on a broader notion of qualified entity , according to which any person or collective affected by an environmental issue could have the right to justice .
These requirements proposed under the regulation cover not only Community institutions but all bodies that exercise public functions under the Treaties , also comprising the agencies , offices or bodies such as the European Investment Bank , to the extent that their activities are relevant to environmental matters as dealt with by the Convention .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by expressing my thanks for , and congratulations on , the result that has been achieved after all .
This makes it perfectly clear that a new directive is needed in this field .
This is a much @-@ needed report and , for obvious reasons , the accidents in Romania and Spain , but also other incidents that have taken place around the Union over time , have demonstrated quite clearly that this kind of material poses a real danger to human health and to the environment if it is mismanaged .
I am glad to say also that the Declaration endorsed a proposal made by European parliamentarians to declare 11 March a European Day commemorating the victims of terrorism .
Protecting the most vulnerable members of our society is an essential part of the Lisbon Agenda .
Finally , with regard to the important issue of Cyprus , I would like on behalf of our group to reiterate our unconditional support for the efforts being made by the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations to find a solution to the issue of Cyprus and by doing so to help the enlargement process to be successful .
Al Qaeda has bombed America , it has bombed Africa , it has bombed Asia , it has bombed the Middle East and it is now bombing Europe .
- Mr President , 25 countries have now agreed to prepare an EU Constitution by 17 June .
The Irish presidency has so far done good work .
It is important to point out , Mr President , that , not only in view of the phenomenon of terrorism , but also of the crisis with the Stability Pact , the appreciation of the Euro and the challenges and opportunities raised by enlargement , the climate in the European Union at the moment is not at its most optimistic .
The implementation of internal market legislation in the Member States must be stepped up .
It is a point that I underlined most strongly in addressing my colleagues at the European Council .
The delegation is in Strasbourg for a number of meetings with our delegation to the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee .
In these circumstances , we can withdraw Amendment No 3 and can also announce that Amendment No 2 will be replaced by Amendment No 4 .
.
Furthermore , the form of waste recovery that the proposal advocates is aimed at preserving resources , reducing the pressure that is exerted on the exploitation of natural resources .
The European Parliament has made this false move because it wants to boost its own importance and acquire the image of a defender of freedom ; it may also be due to an element of anti @-@ American demagogy and , lastly , to provocation from the Commission , which has clearly exceeded its powers .
We will not be led by prejudice and we will not have tabloid newspapers writing our script .
Some Member States have postponed ratification precisely because they have been dissatisfied with Croatia &apos;s levels of cooperation with the Hague Court .
There can be no compromise on these fundamental values ; there is no trade @-@ off .
Misconduct on the part of government personnel and police officials , conditions in prisons , unequal treatment , discrimination , racism , xenophobia , anti @-@ Semitism and particularly recently , the increasingly @-@ threatened erosion of civil rights , such as the rights of suspects , the presumption of innocence , and last but not least , privacy - all of this under the guise of the fight against terrorism .
On every occasion , it is remarkable how each rapporteur manages to outshine their predecessors in criminalising millions of Europeans who are faced with the tragic effects of unbridled immigration .
I feel , however , that for Members of this House , who are soon to go before the electorate in elections that are especially important for the EU &apos;s future , it is worth recalling that the extraordinarygains of the past five years in the area of human rights are something to be proud of and may , indeed , encourage the citizens to take part in the electoral process , given the prospects for establishing a European policy on fundamental rights .
The European Union has a major role to play here in demanding , through the Member States , that the World Bank should take account of the study &apos;s recommendations .
In addition to the human dimension of these events , we Portuguese have linguistic and cultural ties with that country .
He outlined in considerable detail the efforts that have been made .
This should be applied to all fisheries agreements and not just this one .
We welcome the increase in halibut quotas , which means that national fleets may now catch 800 tonnes of Greenland halibut .
This is a crucial point in the discussion of the requirements the American authorities are imposing on carriers .
How does the Danish protocol work in this area , Commissioner ?
In view of the current malfunctions , what are the advantages of inclusion in the budget ?
To work for development , in fact , it would be more logical to delegate control to the joint ACP / EU Parliamentary Assembly .
I therefore think that the further implementation of the procedure and the directive , and also the way in which the public and the persons concerned around the airports are informed and may be able to play a part in raising the alarm , will give rise to further refinement of the procedures .
Since a slot is considered a public asset , the public authority always has prerogatives which are being maintained in all cases .
The reform process has given public debate in Turkey a new mood of openness and freedom .
We have similar problems in countries like Romania and Bulgaria .
It is true that Turkey has not always had a coherent framework enabling it to guarantee political , civil , economic , social and cultural rights .
It is , secondly , very much in our own interests that Turkey should become democratic and be under the rule of law , and that we should support developments towards this end .
The military were present outside many polling stations within the Kurdish area .
These objectives , however , have yet to be achieved .
Mr Leinen mentioned the 1963 Association Agreement .
I am making this request because yesterday in this House Commissioner Vitorino announced two substantial amendments to the initiative , which I believe should be subject to further analysis in committee and , furthermore , this is laid down as an ordinary procedure in the Rule I have mentioned .
In this context , and in view of the fact that this is a country with few resources and many needs , the income from fishing is of particular importance and therefore deserves special protection .
. In its communication on air safety , published last year , the Commission expressed concern at the link between the number of air accidents and the increase in air traffic .
Lastly , there is the link between these conditions and the need for a serious evaluation of the current state of fisheries resources and of the appropriate measures to ensure the conservation of these resources , an area in which issues of liberalising access and the underlying contradictions are to a large extent echoed in the situation in Portugal .
I hope that lessons will be learnt for the future .
I support the position adopted by Mr Queiró , which he expressed in plenary , on the need for the Council and the Commission to make a clear and precise assessment of the consequences of Turkey &apos;s accession .
I do not think much of this idea at all , as it makes Europe more expensive as an industrial location .
The promotion of re @-@ use is extremely important and particularly respect for the judgment of the European Court of Justice that waste incineration of municipal household waste is disposal and not recovery .
It is for that reason that our resolution makes it very clear that it is necessary to provide for the appropriate measures , and that means that institutions providing funding - such as , among others , the European Investment Bank - must give priority to renewable energies and to energy efficiency .
It is monstrous that there should be someone in this House who is attempting to make criminals of these Members , of all people , who are performing their duties in an exemplary manner .
This is a completely unfounded allegation . The same Committee on Petitions sent us the first petition pursuant to Article 7 of the Treaty so that we could look into it .
If the Americans do not get by this route the information they require , they will obtain it by other means , whether this involves questioning at the border , mandatory visas or interviews in Consulates @-@ General .
Evidently , penalties should still be resorted to if necessary - let us be clear on this particular point .
It is therefore also your final opportunity to ensure that when you have to inform your voters about precisely what you have done to further consumer interests and the enforcement of law , you have a tangible example to show them .
We retain only one rate , the overall effective annual rate .
Traders simply need to comply with the requirements applicable in the country where they introduce their products onto the market .
.
I commend this proposal to you as a major advance in consumer protection and I look forward to the forthcoming discussion .
Directive 91 / 414 / EEC on the marketing and use of pesticides governs agricultural production and I intend to bring forward proposals to amend it later this year .
European company law can either legislate to harmonise this , or do nothing and let the inevitable process of convergence be driven by the market , providing no particular model is discriminated against .
It is also necessary to re @-@ establish the liability of the payment service providers over the whole of the payment chain .
Some of those that participated might feel let down , as a voluntary commitment was altered to a compulsory regulation in the Commission &apos;s reading .
I do not share his views on changing the legal basis , but he certainly has worked in a most constructive manner also .
As its title indicates , the proposal is aimed at improving the environmental behaviour , what could be termed the Eco @-@ design , of energy @-@ using products .
I therefore share my fellow Members &quot; disappointment that no agreement was reached with the Council at first reading .
Point 7 : the agreement that the Member States have to make half of their Kyoto efforts in their own countries and half abroad , has been re @-@ confirmed .
Many Member States had still not notified a plan by 31 March at all , and some have submitted plans that are far from ambitious .
Neither are they prohibited in the framework of the battery directive , because , as you heard a moment ago , they are included in the list of exceptions .
At the moment , these substitutes do not exist for all applications .
The debate is closed .
That does not necessarily mean that you need to get Parliament &apos;s backing , but mainly that you do need it from the Member States .
It is therefore making a victim out of the attacker .
We are delighted to be able to conclude that the Member States have caught up with regard to the directive on port state control and the classification bureaus .
We are among those who think that the insurance arrangements must be strengthened and , in particular , extended to cover the degree of danger presented by the cargoes and not only their value .
We must - and I think the Commission has a role to play in this respect - support the moves by those who would clearly like to change the image of their industry .
As such , we support the proposal on the setting up of a European coastguard service .
The future is where we are and this is what we are all working on together .
On the other hand , the Member States must tackle the costs - including social costs - involved in the growth of mobility , from increased air and noise pollution to environmental problems , and above all increased congestion and rising accident rates .
Nevertheless , warm thanks to the rapporteur .
The scope of the control to be carried out in industrial areas has been substantially extended , for example to the weekly driving times , the total driving times during two successive weeks , the weekly rest times and offset times .
The debate is closed .
I propose that the debate on this motion of censure be scheduled for tomorrow , 21 April at 9 p.m .
I hope that these new Member States will rapidly integrate the process of the Single European Sky so as to allow the airspace to be properly managed over the entire territory of the unified Union .
The protection of personal data should not be viewed as an obstacle to effectively fighting terrorism , which means that we have certain reservations about the changes proposed to the regulation , in spite of the European Parliament &apos;s amendments , which specifically refer to these rights .
Our support for the total exclusion of nuclear projects is absolutely solid , and this is why we were unable to accept the de Roo report at the end of the day .
That is why this regulation is essential , and why its adoption today is necessary .
Nevertheless , this proposal for a directive , amended by Parliament , aims to improve the rights of consumers who have been the victims of unfair practice , provides a clause that establishes a general prohibition of unfair commercial practices , clarifies the definition of such practices , broadens the range of practices covered , provides stronger measures to protect consumers deemed vulnerable , such as children and the elderly , and involves consumers &quot; organisations more closely in drafting codes of conduct .
This is one of the reasons why the Commission decided to opt for the collection of all batteries , so as to ensure that the valuable material contained in all batteries could be recycled .
Now that another task has been entrusted to me in my country , I am pleased to be able to pay tribute to you and take my leave as is customary between partners and between friends , because I cannot forget - and have no wish to - that the battles I had for nearly five years here in Strasbourg and in Brussels in the service of the Commission were battles shared by and with this House .
The Commission , however , has proposed a further seven @-@ year period as a transitional phase for many reasons , which I do not wish to recapitulate here .
The plan to the budgetise the European Development Fund must not result in a reduction in the overall development finance for ACP countries .
The debate is closed .
We simply help agriculture .
It must not , however , encourage or sow the seeds of new injustices .
The budget of 2005 will thus be presented to a host of new faces , not least within the Commission .
With regard to the substance of this apparent agreement , it is evident , particularly in my own region , that we are not prepared for enlargement as far as the transport infrastructure is concerned and that there is an urgent need for funding here . It is therefore unacceptable that an important project proposed by the Commission under parliamentary pressure should now be ditched .
Section VIII - Ombudsman
Parliament has free cars at its disposal , and thus there is no reason to also have a system for reimbursing taxi fares ; we can pay these ourselves out of our subsistence allowance .
Geography , as I have often said in the past in Zagreb , is not destiny .
Mr President , as there is so little time , two very short questions .
We would like to see a clear timetable emerging in June , and not postponement to some vague point in the future .
That is not acceptable , and I would ask the President of Parliament to look into this .
Do you agree ?
- I agree with the comments made by Mr Martinez and I should like to take advantage of the debate about Cuba to raise a matter again and ask the Commissioner if the European Commission or the European Union in general intends to intervene , at long last , in order to put a stop to the embargo which the USA has imposed on Cuba for over forty years , an embargo which has caused and continues to cause immense damage to Cuba and its people .
They made me a confirmed pacifist , a confirmed supporter of the Flemish Movement and a confirmed European .
That is my opinion on this matter ; apart from that there are no problems with the agencies that we are dealing with .
Finally , the Eurostat affair .
It is , however , completely unacceptable for the Commissioner who has formal responsibility to come to us and say , &apos; I am not responsible , because I did not know what was happening . &quot; The implication of Mr Solbes &quot; answer to us is that all the Commissioners will be free from responsibility and will instruct their colleagues not to bring anything near their desks .
I believe that such an agreement is beyond what is achievable today .
Commissioner Patten , I believe that the real reason why the European Union finds itself in a weak position is because we have waived our own rules .
I think that the Commission does have this duty .
Then again , the facts that have been presented to us regarding the risks to freedom of information in Italy are so obvious and serious that it would be pointless to repeat them .
Becoming a theatre of national quarrels for electoral purposes deals a mortal blow to the future of this institution and undermines its foundations and its credibility in the eyes of Europe &apos;s citizens .
- Mr President , I have just become aware of a communication from the services of the sitting which tells Members - and it appears that it was announced at midnight last night - that , in relation to the Boogerd @-@ Quaak report , on freedom of expression and information , in view of the large number of requests for roll @-@ call votes , separate votes and split votes , the vote cannot take place today .
The presentation of the contents of the plan to the public has not always been equally balanced . &apos; 
The situation is not entirely comparable .
You see , you were too quick off the mark again , but I know what I am saying .
Why would the thousands of refuges vote yes when their future looks uncertain , when they will not all return to their family homes and they will not all acquire their property , while at the same time they will also be deprived of the basic human right of the judicial protection of the European Court of Human Rights ?
- Mr President , without doubt there are practical problems with the Annan plan .
Colleagues should be aware that if they vote in favour of Amendment 2 , they are voting in favour of adding Friday sittings to the Strasbourg calendar next year .
The Commissioner exceeded the remit granted to him by his institutional role and the need to respect the democratic rights of which the Commission is supposedly the guardian . Such stands should not be adopted when the common ground of all the Greek parties is that the Cypriot people should decide without pressure , assessing without haste the possibilities and the dangers which each possible outcome of the referendum implies .
Our democracies have ways of exerting pressure . If we do not use them to ensure that our universal values are respected we shall lose our souls .
It is true that everything is not perfect .

This is the reason why , faced with the observation that the economy is slowing down , we must bring everything into play , and it is the duty of the European Union to react .
Therefore , we have introduced a number of recitals that seek to focus upon key areas of implementation .
I had hoped to be in a position to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent report .
When I spoke in similar terms within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs three or four years ago , I think my fellow Members were shocked .
If we could find a new alliance of social forces , then we could really bring the European economy back to its old levels .
As he himself has just admitted , Mr Barón Crespo spoke to a fellow Member yesterday , saying , &apos; &#91; be quiet , wretch &#93; &apos; .
I thank you , therefore , for giving me the floor .
In relation to the Parliamentary report , there is general agreement underlining the need to retain the programme of support for the production and marketing of honey .
. - This report supports the draft regulation establishing a European Railway Agency , which is a further fundamental step towards the Commission &apos;s objective of revitalising the whole European railway industry at both freight and passenger transport levels .
Neither responded .
We are against reflecting in future Community resources the principle of dealing at national level with the consequences of policies decided at Community level and we are against calling on the peoples to foot the bill twice .
At the root of the &apos; scandal &quot; are accusations by certain newspapers regarding &apos; misappropriation of funds , &quot; &apos; personal enrichment &quot; and &apos; nepotism &quot; on the part of Eurostat managers .
. The resolution on which we voted today concerning the state of human rights and democracy in Pakistan , should be viewed in the context of the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Community and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on partnership and development .
I also note the higher percentage of unemployment and poverty among women in the Balkans .
They are bringing their victims , the girls , not to bars or brothels , but to private flats .
They and we may be partners in the war on terrorism , but in that anti @-@ personnel mines have no part ; they are themselves an instrument of terror .
Yes indeed , and I refer you to the full @-@ page article in yesterday &apos;s devoted to unceasing internal efforts to bring about peaceful regime change on the island .
Last February , the wives and mothers of the political prisoners expressed their appreciation to the European institutions for the support they give .
In the past , I have personally called in this House for the expulsion of Nigeria from the Commonwealth in the event of such a barbaric punishment occurring .
We hope that Parliament &apos;s adoption of a resolution which is balanced on this issue will be seen as meaningful encouragement along these lines .
National sovereignty can be exercised and defended only if it is exercised jointly with others .
We must reverse this Malthusian approach with no future and accept that the real driving force for our common development is social progress and the promotion of the human capacities of all the peoples of the Union .
The European Union was created by men , by the founding fathers , who did not want it to be political : they wanted to create an area of peace through law and economics .
As regards the numbers voting , I will ask for a formal legal opinion to answer Baroness Ludford &apos;s question , although , in all probability , the number entitled to vote will be the larger number currently present .
Hence , with the draft of 1984 the process began within the Union which led to the successive revisions of the Treaty of Rome , the Single European Act , the Maastricht Treaty , the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Treaty of Nice , and , subsequently , to the constitutional discussions which took place within the framework of the European Convention .
This is a historic place because the European Parliament is at the heart of democracy in Europe and the only European institution to be elected directly by 450 million European citizens .
Mr President , I very much regret that this will be my last speech to this Parliament , having been here for the past 25 years .
We decided to place the public at the heart of the European project , hence the complete incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Constitutional Treaty .
Eight months on , we are no less convinced of the rightness of our position ; in fact we have , I think , been strengthened in it by the way in which the debate on the European Left has unfolded , by the experiences of several EU countries and , lastly , despite its wishes , by the work of the Commission itself .
One of the key words in the Constitution is &apos; balance . &quot;
What they are doing is now entering a similar system - they just call it pooled sovereignty .
I would like , with your permission , to make a few comments .
The future belongs to those who , despite the uncertainties of the present , can see the coming of tomorrow &apos;s dawn .
Mr President , the request for urgent procedure cannot be accepted by Parliament as the Council has not forwarded to Parliament a text to which the international agreement makes reference , namely the Commission &apos;s draft decision on adequacy , declaring that passengers &apos; data are adequately protected by the US ; nor has it received the so @-@ called undertakings by the US administration .
Although the European Parliament is authorised to exercise the power of democratic control , a majority of its Members has explicitly declined to do so .
I want therefore to read this into the record to once again expose the type of behaviour that Mr Martin engages .
It is true that within the European Parliament we now have a fantastic variety of representation of traditions and cultures , but this is not what Europe is going to be about over the next five to ten years .
Unfortunately , the referenda , the expression of the will of the people , did not bring about the result which we all hoped for .
Courage is also required when considering the future of the European Union , because the process of enlargement will not stop at this stage .
What is particularly shocking today is that restrictions are imposed upon the rights of people from the ten new Member States - their right to travel , settle and work anywhere within the European Union .
We must prepare our European home for the accession of so many new countries .
- Madam President , yesterday , when we welcomed Members from the ten new Member States , many speakers spoke in terms of the dream of the unification of the continent of Europe coming true .
In this case Europe &apos;s eastern border will soon resemble the US @-@ Mexico border , together with all the similar problems .
Today we are debating difficulties related to partnership with our neighbours .
These concepts are not a threat , but the key to economic prosperity .
We should have no reservations about working jointly with Russia and Ukraine .
This occurred because the advanced Western countries took advantage of their superior competitive position to break into the markets opening up in the eastern countries with an annual increase in their economic potential of about USD 50 billion .
We have all seen the labour market surveys that deal with the expected movement of workers from the ten new Member States .
There is no social stability and no real prosperity where there is unemployment , where there are imminent threats to existing jobs and competitiveness is gradually eroded due to macro @-@ economic policies , fiscal measures and constraints that are not adapted to the existing situation on the ground .
With some support , it could develop impressively and benefit the whole European Union .
The principle of solidarity , which already applies today , will be more clearly laid down in the Constitutional text concerning border controls , asylum and immigration .
It is difficult to solve these conflicts , but I believe that the Members of the enlarged European Union , together with the citizens of Europe , will be able to find the answers .
Unfortunately , the reality of the modern world speaks of the intensification of blind violence , hatred and terrorism .
This right , this freedom , is enshrined in the Treaties . It is also contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and has its own very practical dimensions .
While in a formal sense my Commission is coming towards the end of its natural life , from a practical point of view we have a full agenda in front of us .
Instead , we must avail ourselves of every opportunity to urge others , America , Russia , China , and Japan among them , to abide by these agreements .
Finally , complete your mandate fully and do not resign prematurely .
This tends to be a job that no one wants to take on , precisely because for many long years it only causes headaches and brings no benefits ; nonetheless , we really have laid the foundations for zero tolerance .
We in the Committee on Development and Cooperation , and the ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly , would like reassurance that we can expect the same level of commitment from the new Commission as we have from the current Commission .
Mr President , health is a much treasured gift and one of the most important concerns of every citizen of the European Union .
We brought the Europe of values .
You have brought this Parliament closer to reforms than ever before and I have no doubt that as a result of your work we will succeed in reforming this House .
It therefore follows that I approve of the composition of the new Commission .
Allow me to emphasise once again that my aim is for this House to become a forum for strategic debate .
It is only right , in the hour of triumph , to think of those who do not share in it , so let me address the opposing candidates , such as you , Mr Geremek .
During our presidency we enjoyed an immensely cooperative and mutually supportive relationship with the European Parliament , which was an essential element in the realisation of many of our presidency goals .
Our presidency had responsibility for managing the initial phase of negotiations on the future Financial Perspectives which will determine funding for the Union from 2007 to 2013 .
This decision confirms the Union &apos;s willingness to hold out the prospect of accession to the tormented countries in that part of our continent .
I thank you all the same .
I am delighted to acknowledge the great success of your presidency of the European Council , but this is against a backdrop of some neglect on the Irish front .
And so it proved to be that meddle time - happily - was at a premium .
We have just one major regret : that an explicit reference to the European Union &apos;s Christian roots , which form the true bridge linking western Europe with eastern Europe , was not inserted into the preamble .
From day one we in Ireland have opened our doors to all parts of Europe and we did not distinguish between people from old and new Member States .
The latest addition to this family is Erasmus Mundus , a programme of crucial importance that will bring thousands of students from all over the world to our universities and will help to restore Europe &apos;s role as a world leader in research and higher education .
With the summer recess and a new Parliament and Commission rushing to find their feet , you must achieve in three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half months what many presidencies struggle to achieve in six .
Indeed , we should think very carefully about how consistent this is with our European values .
That aspiration involves exchanging hallmarks of European civilisation for America &apos;s tough and ruthless system .
If I may adapt Berthold Brecht &apos;s phrase , we cannot elect a new public in Europe ; we have to live and work with the one we have .
This is where the signing of the Constitutional Treaty offers you an opportunity ; use it as the beginning of a professional information and communication campaign .
Many speakers have spoken about the importance of the European economy and the strengthening of the economic structure and , in that context , you have asked for a lot of attention for the Lisbon process .
I would have liked Mr Barroso to have told us about the lessons he has drawn from his national experience for his European mandate , if he receives it .
Firstly , on the role of the Commission and the appointment of its President , secondly , on the common foreign and security policy and , thirdly , on diversity , subsidiarity and shared sovereignties in the European Union .
This leads me to the next question . Do you intend to do all you can to persuade the Council to make adequate provision for the additional tasks of properly integrating the new Member States into the body of the Union through the allocation of funding in the 2007 @-@ 2013 Financial Perspective ?
Mr Barroso , I urge you , in future , to fight for a citizens &quot; Europe , to listen to public opinion , and that includes where Turkey is concerned .
We welcome his assurance that the confidence of European citizens in Europe and how it operates will need to be strengthened .
I am absolutely delighted that you have pointed out the importance of the multifaceted and rich national , regional , cultural , linguistic and political traditions of the Member States .
But we must also fight epidemics like AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis .
That is why I see the Lisbon agenda as an economic agenda , an agenda for competitiveness , but also a social agenda and an agenda for environmental protection .
The candidate has presented himself as a bridge @-@ builder and as an honest broker , thus demonstrating his desire to help achieve consensus .
The closest we can get to that are governments .
Contrary to some popular conception in the UK , farmers in Yorkshire are certainly not whingers .
- Mr President , I have a point of order with regard to the agenda .
The Mediterranean forest is part of the common heritage of the people of Europe and must therefore be preserved .
It is also in the passengers &quot; interests that European airlines should answer questions about the possible effects on air transport and on how they compete with the airlines of third countries - all the more so in view of the extremely heavy economic burdens already placed on European airlines by the consequences of what happened on 11 September 2001 and by the increase in the price of oil .
We have strict rules in place that regulate the movement of waste within and outside the European Union .
The Council has asked us for urgent procedure , and we regard that request as justified for the very simple reason that , as my grandmother used to say fifty years ago , you do not want to wait until the cows have gone before shutting the gate to the enclosure .
Once Parliament has formed its opinion , it must ensure that its view is known and taken into account in the ratification process .
I think the time has come for the House to demonstrate the maturity and responsibility of its parliamentary diplomacy by working more closely with the Commission and the Council on the international scene .
In two areas of your mandate you can expect aggressive backing from Liberals and Democrats .
Mr President , all of us here today have been elected in democratic elections to represent our voters .
Academic institutions trying to work independently are being closed down either temporarily or outright .
Media outlets in Belarus are being closed down .
What is inspiring , though , is the honourable object , the general well @-@ being of the Belarussian population , with the active involvement of civil society and , if possible , both local and regional authorities .
We in the Commission are prepared to promote that activity , but we must appreciate that there are limits .
We will try to ensure that you can do so next time .
It will be necessary to invest more in the trans @-@ European networks , to which you referred , and , of course , also in education and training .
The three priorities should therefore definitely be maintained , and , without denying the importance of the other priorities , I should like to ask you to pay special attention to those concerning competitiveness and cohesion .
I should also like to thank you and your staff for the commitment and seriousness - and charm - that you brought to your other work in the Commission .
This year , however , it appears that they have underestimated their own capacities , and at any rate we currently have a significantly higher implementation rate for structural funds than last year .
The savings have hit what we call the other institutions particularly hard , and that is something at which we want to look in detail in Parliament .
I do think , though , that for a few years now , a new element has crept into the Council &apos;s budget , namely spending for the common foreign and security policy .
It is therefore justified that Parliament should stand by the Commission &apos;s proposal the Council .
Many of you were right to mention the importance of new priorities , new countries and solidarity .
In such cases a separate market exists where the consumer has an additional test mark , and can therefore see that an authorised testing agency has addressed the issue . The test mark allows the consumer to see that he can buy a very safe product .
Now this new legal basis for sport , as proposed by the Convention , has also been placed in the context of policy on sports .
The discussions intensified with the proposed Directive presented by the Commission in 2001 , and the in @-@ depth debates which took place in relation to it led the Commission to introduce various modifications to the text , particularly in response to the opinions expressed by Parliament at first and second readings .
What strategy will it adopt to maintain and improve the competitive position of the European textiles industry worldwide ?
Had this situation not been corrected in the meantime under the new presidential decree , the Commission would in theory have been able to institute the proceedings for which provision is made in articles 226 and 228 , the purpose of which is to proclaim that the Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty and to force it to comply .
In mobilising aid we have been facing persistent administrative blockages from the Government of Sudan and major logistical problems resulting in substantial additional costs .
They do not trust the Sudanese Government and are calling for justice to be done and for the crimes against them not to go unpunished .
Let us just think of how few doors we have knocked on in all these months .
We are deeply aware of the suffering of the people there and of what has happened .
That brings me to terrorism in Russia .
I think we can all readily comprehend what it means when , in a particular town , not one single family is not lamenting a victim , and most of those families have lost children .
Never have children been struck down with such savagery and determination outside conventional conflicts .
- Mr President , we should express our deepest condolences to the victims of Beslan and their relatives .
Having said that , what can we say about State barbarism ?
As I have already stated , these conclusions also contain very specific action points .
In the coming months , we will continue to implement the proposals set out in our communication of 9 June , which has received widespread endorsement .
The new Iraq must be built on stable democratic institutions .
In previous capacities , I too have tried to persuade the United States that the invasion of Iraq is one thing , but the establishment of democracy there is something else entirely .
The European Union has not been authorised in this way .
This Protocol sets fishing opportunities for the Community tuna fleet and promotes the development of cooperation based on respect for the laws and regulations under Malagasy national fisheries policy .
We also ask that the body of Enzo Baldoni be returned and , in this respect , we ask for his family to be shown pity as well .
In strengthening and clarifying the Stability and Growth Pact , due consideration should be given to strengthening its economic rationale and its implementation .
The pact risks being revealed to be a paper tiger ; confidence in the euro is shattered , and so the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomes the promptness and decisiveness with which Commissioner Almunia has come up with proposals for saving the Pact .
The Pact should prompt discipline , it should be a big stick to keep us on the right track .
At the time , it was said in the debate that more account should be taken of economic trends , thus enabling the surpluses saved up from prosperous years to be used in lean years .
Mr President , the Court of Justice &apos;s ruling of 13 July was a positive development in the battle of the Stability and Growth Pact .
As has been remarked by some speakers , the Stability and Growth Pact is not a solution to everything .
Of concern is the proposal for an extended period of weak economic growth , which would in effect offer a limitless time for those politicians who are unable or do not want to undertake structural reforms in their countries .
We the presidency , and particularly the European Affairs Ministers , will make sure that we can table concrete proposals that will be discussed at the European Council of 5 November .
Has it not become clear to you that a great deal of courage is required to defend together this common project for a common future ?
- Mr President , my speech is in Finnish and Swedish .
We are not impartial towards that Treaty .
I urge you to take this issue very seriously .
We therefore hope that the European Commission will show solidarity with Portuguese women , that it will oppose intolerance and will fall into line with positions that Parliament has already taken in this regard .
Citizens of Europe and defenders of women &apos;s rights have been prevented from entering a European country and treated as though they are criminals .
Mr President , I should like to address the Commission about European citizens , &quot; and particularly women &apos;s , right to information .
In Portugal , at least one in four women has had a back @-@ street abortion , which is , as much as anything , an extremely serious public health problem .
Therefore whilst again congratulating the Portuguese Government that set an example to others , I appeal that we should not muddle people &apos;s minds regarding this issue by entering into matters that do not concern us .
- Mr President , the resolution on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is an important step in preparation for the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention .
Our primary goal is the conservation of nature , which in the first place means protection of the environment , in other words , the maintenance of the ecological balance .
I would like to amend paragraph 5 of our text : &apos; welcomes the Australian proposal to list the great white shark in CITES Appendix II &apos; .
I support paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution to this effect .
Mr President , I just wanted to ask whether we were going to benefit from the presence of the presidency of the Council this afternoon , because the remarks that I want to make - and which I am sure many of my colleagues will be making - are in fact directed at the Council .
In addition , EU Member States will vote against extending loans to Burma from international financial institutions .
We also have to tell the old @-@ established Serbs in Vojvodina that we know of the good they have done for this multinational region , that this policy of ours is not anti @-@ Serb , but that it is our concern , in the world of many and varied cultures that is Vojvodina , to re @-@ establish the sort of co @-@ existence that prevailed for centuries .
But if you were to go there , Mr President , you would have to pay $ 300 a night to stay in one of those rooms !
This situation can only worsen with an increase in the violent storms caused by global warming .
After the war in Iraq , many claimed that the gap between the two continents could no longer be bridged .
You told us that you wanted to put Europe at the service of the people of Europe .
For instance , we were ignored every time we highlighted the need for regulation of information technology , at least for EU countries , with the result that today international terrorism has also become mass media terrorism .
Finally , we must lament the fact that the reform of the Stability Pact , which has been considered an urgent matter since 2001 , is still incomplete , particularly after the crisis following 11 September .
That was an overt way of making it clear that leading the Commission cannot be combined with participating in national politics .
.
As I approach the end of my term as a Commissioner - I underline &apos; as a Commissioner &quot; - I have started going to the theatre again .
They cannot put an end to the violence and the acts of terrorism , and they cannot bring about what all of us in this House want to see : two states living peacefully side by side and with respect for one another .
The Middle East question ought , moreover , to have absolute priority in the relations between the European Union and the United States - in the hope that there will be a change in the administration there .
Madam President , Mr Solana , Commissioner , I would like to start by apologising for the fact that another commitment will require me to leave shortly after I have finished speaking .
But the solution of those problems will not be as simple and easy as the one I mentioned before , which was resolved quite smoothly through the autonomy process .
For the European Union , this is not about wanting to elbow Russia out of that part of Europe and extending its own geostrategic interest in Eastern Europe .
Needless to say , preventing and fighting terrorism is also an item on the agenda .
We have arrived at a crucial moment for the area of freedom , security and justice .
An area of freedom and justice , however , cannot be built on the basis of responses or reactions to attacks and we do not want to see the third significant initiative relating to this area being taken following attacks .
It is then our responsibility to ensure that reception is possible in those countries of transit , which can also be done under the remit of the High Commissioner for refugees .
Kalle Jonsson has been waiting to be tried since 2001 .
This process also involves targeted policies on the part of the European Union , which aim to bring to a conclusion the process of border agreement negotiation between the New Member States and their neighbours , for which the new members have done everything in their power .
The decision to set up a Chemicals Agency has been made by the European Council .
I would now like to address a number of specific questions raised by the honourable Members of this House , and I should like to start with the GSP + .
If this assessment is available , could Parliament have this without delay ?
This brings me to a point that Mr Van Hecke raised : first of all we must try to ensure that rules of origin take into account second @-@ stage products , which help countries to industrialise , and particularly ones such as cotton .
The number of beneficiaries will , of course , be reviewed , and this review will be based on one criterion - that of market share .
First , by highlighting the use of anabolic agents as a public health problem , as you quite rightly said .
Yet there is another urgent need , which is that political prisoners , the intelligentsia , writers and politicians must be included in democratic life .
Doping , however , has become a scourge the world over .
. I voted in favour of Report A6 @-@ 0008 / 2004 because I feel that the EU &apos;s actions should be aimed at promoting European products ever more effectively , whilst respecting their diversity as regards production conditions and methods of processing , conserving and use .
The working class and the people of Europe must obstruct and step up their fight against the so @-@ called AFSJ , because it opposes their rights and serves the &apos; justice &apos; of big business and the multinationals .
The EU continues to do much to combat the rise of Aids and to provide information on preventive health programmes and support for access to anti @-@ viral treatment for all .
We must not stand idly by as service providers from the new Member States are faced with worse conditions and greater difficulties on the European market than those from the old Member States .
Nevertheless , overall GDP in the euro area increased by only 0.5 % in 2003 .
To sum up , we should allow the ECB the freedom to act in the manner laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union .
In demanding structural reforms , it stigmatises social systems and pension schemes . It also calls for an increase in the working hours of European workers .
Competitiveness , economic reform and new industrial policy are now high on the political agenda of the Commission and will receive even more focus in the new Commission .
Mr President , Commissioner , I do not intend to repeat what many of the other Members of this House , including Mr Mann , have already said about the automotive industry being one of the most important in Western Europe and the need for it to stay that way .
That record was last broken in 1972 .
Fifthly , we should stress the need to support vulnerable social groups , as this will mitigate the reduction in their income and prevent their social and economic marginalisation .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the continual rise in oil prices is again bringing home to us our economic dependency on third states .
In June , a consensus of the Heads of State or Government nominated me as President of the Commission . On 22 July , Parliament gave me its confidence with a large majority .
It will urge those third countries that are our partners to sign up to and comply with the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees .
At the end of the day , after weighing up all of the facts and all of the observations that have been made about individual candidates , do we have a fundamental confidence in this Commission as a whole , as a collective body , or do we not ?
Against the backdrop of this fundamental challenge to Mr Barroso &apos;s economic , social and environmental choices , the Buttiglione bomb has gone off .
Take the vote seriously ; discharge Commissioners who do not have the confidence of Parliament !
This is a case of discrimination on the basis of religious conviction , and that is something of which the European Parliament should not be guilty .
It takes someone on the ball to forge a unified team from this motley crew : a European government that is able to halt the Commission &apos;s loss of prestige that has been going on for years .
The state has no right to poke its nose into such matters .
To lie is a sin : with a grain of repentance on this issue , you could have earned a tiny bit of neutrality from quarters other than those which are supporting you today .
I believe that this is an important and decisive point that we should keep to the forefront of our minds .
Do you not find it strange that populists , those who wage a constant battle against the credibility of our institutions , can vote against this Commission alongside committed Europeans , as most Members of this House are , I am sure ?
The EU countries that have managed to keep the peace within their boundaries are now supporting peace operations in other parts of the world and are sending their troops to those regions for that purpose .
In spite of this , we ought to have views on the work of the ECB when it comes to actions that also affect the countries outside the eurozone .
In Heading 1 - Agriculture - we have voted for EUR 50.779 million in commitment appropriations .
We have no objections whatsoever to contributing to the reconstruction in Iraq .
The first is that 2005 is the first complete financial year for the Europe of Twenty @-@ Five . Secondly , and in consequence of that , it is only right that the overall funds available in the preliminary draft Budget for regional policy were increased , the payment appropriations to a greater extent than the commitment appropriations , where the increase was more modest .
It was another feat of strength on the part of the Budget Committee to package , process and prioritise the many amendments tabled by Members to the Budget for 2005 , and I compliment the rapporteur , Mr Garriga Polledo , who has drafted this report and the many amendments to it with the sure @-@ footedness of one who is very experienced in budgeting .
You can expect this House to stand firm ; we will tell people what is needed and also where we can make savings .
It is worth remembering that approximately 90 % of the budgetary resources comes from the base of gross national income and from resources derived from income from Value Added Tax , and that these resources are closely related to the pace of economic growth .
We believe that the expenditure is too high , with the commitments amounting to 1.14 % of gross domestic income .
A large slice of the money it encompasses will be used to brainwash the public into thinking that the European Union is wonderful and that &apos; integration &apos; really is a nice word .
They are taking crucial responsibilities and powers of financial control away from us and holding up the gentlemen &apos;s agreement in order to stave off our reaction .
Lastly I should like to ask the Commissioner whether he would agree that this matter should now be raised within the UN Security Council .
The Commission will continue to take all necessary measures , firstly to help Turkey in its fight against torture and ill @-@ treatment , and secondly in order to monitor current developments .
Having thoroughly examined the Systembolaget system with regard to points of sale , choice of products and promotional activities , the Court decided that the monopoly sales structure of Systembolaget was compatible with Article 31 of the Treaty .
Would the Commissioner just comment on that as an area where the new Commission should certainly take an interest , since , if consumers are to have accurate information , we need to tighten up on labelling .
As he says , rights and dignity are what we seek .
The topics with which the European Council intends to deal next week are very closely connected to these issues .
How many European states are setting their national economic agendas with Lisbon in mind ?
We must lend support to these success factors , but one aspect of this is the need for better determination of whether national parliaments are really keeping their side of the bargain .
The concern is that today , instead of what was promised , we have 20 million people unemployed and around 70 million people at risk of poverty .
I should therefore like to formally draw attention to the fact that , as you know , the Spring European Council is the crucial European Council - the one at which decisions on the whole Lisbon Strategy are to be taken - and that the activities of this November &apos;s European Council should be seen as a preparation for this Spring European Council , to be led by the Luxemburg Presidency .
Tampere II speeds up procedures for restricting the granting of asylum , promotes camps for rounding up immigrants outside Europe , introduces biometric data and strengthens obscure , centralised services , EU information systems and mechanisms for legalising repression on the pretext of organised crime and terrorism , thereby shielding the dictatorship of European capital .
I ask you to bring us a new proposal , one offering the possibility of broader support for the Commission .
Before making any decision , Martin Luther King used to ask himself : &apos; Is it right ? &quot;
Today , I believe that we have made broader and more fruitful cooperation possible .
The Summit on 8 November will prove this .
While we welcome the indications that relations between India and Pakistan are bearing fruit in the shape of a potential resolution of the conflict in Kashmir , which gives cause for rejoicing , we also demand and expressly seek the acceleration , as a matter of urgency , of nuclear disarmament across the region , for the sake of the safety of the people who live there .
These attacks , especially the attack on the life and health of opposition leader Lebedko , seem to have been well targeted and prepared .
It is more important than ever to continue and develop our efforts to support civil society and democratic forces in Belarus .
We need to be honest with ourselves , however , and admit that this is also a failure for the European Union &apos;s policy on Belarus so far .
I also agree with those who said it is important to try to find ways to improve the situation , especially by direct contact with civil society .
We should not forget , though , that there is a significant difference in comparison with other states in the region .
In addition , of course , we need to react .
I am just happy that he is alive and able to continue campaigning , thus maintaining the broad field of candidates from which the Ukrainian people can choose .
Although some progress has been made in this area , various problems , particularly the problem of the legal position of non @-@ Muslim religious communities and the registration of ownership , have not so far been resolved .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you said that this issue is dealt with better in Turkey &apos;s legislation than in that of some Member States .
This being the case , the European Parliament can find out about our objectives and priorities for the European drugs strategy before then .
It is worth mentioning that one criterion for the granting of financial aid - in the Structural Funds , for example - is the promotion of gender equality .
With the right political and economic decisions , this state of affairs can be changed .
This unquestionably has an effect on the nature of their jobs and their salaries , but it is equally true that many women directly suffer hidden wage discrimination , either because many of them are employed in the lower paid posts , or because lower salaries are paid to categories largely made up of women or because reducing women &apos;s rights increases the incentive to employ them .
It should be noted that for every animal stranded , many hundreds more are killed or severely injured but we never get to know about them because they never reach the shores .
Amendment No 65 , in line 04.02.12 , is accepted with an increase of EUR 1 million .
.
Part of this Parliament therefore wants to bring about an alliance and close , mutually beneficial economic cooperation , without further attention being paid to the major problems that remain unresolved as regards human rights and the threat of war .
The next item is the debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law - Duration : one hour maximum ( Rule 50 of the EP Rules of Procedure )
Mr President , the first time I gave any serious attention to cluster bombs was in 1999 , when NATO was waging a war of aggression on Yugoslavia , in which cluster bombs were deployed .
Applying the designation of &apos; terrorist &quot; to organisations should not be something to be bartered with .
Yes , Mr Casaca , you had requested the floor .
The vote will take place next .
Given that the ΙΡΑ will cover sectors such as the strengthening of institutions and regional and cross @-@ border cooperation , among others , payment of the planned assistance needs to be linked to strict terms of political conditionality , terms which make up the political .
We should not avoid a debate about Islam in Europe , even if it were to unite all moderate forces , religious or otherwise , in order to isolate and fight extremism and racism .
Since then a lot has happened , most importantly the review of the Code of Conduct .
Thank you Mr Patten , this is an important issue and we must move on to the debate . Nevertheless , I cannot resist saying that you are somewhat like Frank Sinatra : we never grow tired of your goodbyes .
If it turns out that by taking the lead we will impoverish our societies and economies in the name of the so @-@ called values at which we excel , and that others will take our place , increasing their advantage over our economies and the opportunities we have to influence the global situation , we will actually reduce our chances of improving the enforcement of human rights throughout the world .
It is a fact that uncontrolled arms exports undermine global security .
An operational concept has been approved , force generation has taken place , and 11 third countries have been invited to contribute to the operation .
This operation follows on from those in Macedonia and in the Congo ; it is the third of its kind and also the biggest , involving 7.000 men and women , so it is much bigger than anything of which we have prior experience .
I also hope that the EU takeover of military responsibility will lead to an energetic effort to find war criminals and deliver them to The Hague .
Also , as the committee has requested , and in order not to leave any doubt about the future of the Agency , we will ensure that any proposal to extend the Agency beyond 2006 should be made by the Commission by 31 March 2006 at the latest .

It appears that the European Union has no problems with the fact that a candidate country is occupying part of the territory of an existing Member State .
A couple of other Members suggested that we should concentrate our support on one place : Famugusta .
In all honesty , I am really pleased that it is you we can talk to today about the EU &apos;s climate policy and its contribution to the climate conference in Buenos Aires in December .
Mr President , we need cleaner energy and more efficient technologies and , in order to achieve that , we need incentives - negative incentives , if you like - such as a carbon tax .
It states that Member States can promote reuse , provided that - and that is important - that is done in compliance with the Treaty and does not disrupt the internal market .
On that basis the original agreement on dates should stand .
We should not really talk about humanitarian assistance in this context because we would deliver humanitarian assistance in any case , without any political considerations .
Frankly , there is no reason why Europe should align itself with such measures .
This was done last year in protest , after Mr Castro imprisoned 75 dissidents and human rights activists and executed three ferry highjackers fleeing the island .
This action clearly infuriated the Cubans .
Two own @-@ initiative inquiries were closed with positive results during the year .
I should like to take this opportunity to remind the chairman of this committee that I myself held this office 15 years ago .
Today we are examining the report for the year 2003 , upon which Mr De Rossa has spoken on behalf of our committee .
It simply reflects the fact that it is with the Commission that the vast majority of citizens have dealings .
Let me also say that our group finds it regrettable that the motion on subsidiarity tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was not adopted .
A vote in favour of investiture is a vote of confidence .
I want Mr Barrot to know that , even though he is from a political family other than our own , his political integrity , in particular , is beyond any doubt .
It is now clear that all Commissioners are on probation and we should be paying particular attention to Neelie Kroes in her role as Competition Commissioner , as her previous job as a lobbyist could well bring about a conflict of interest .
Regrettably , the compromise resolution did not include any call for compliance with this principle , which was contained in an amendment tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group .
.
.
In consequence of this , China declared it to be a state and a nation without sovereignty and without any right to sovereignty .
Secondly , a government decree of May 2002 , however , prescribes the registration of all religious groups .
Otherwise , we would have to hold a debate .
Today , although mouthing commitment to democracy , it clings to the weapons of terror .
The first pillar supports the reform process in Turkey .
Firstly , why is it so simple for Mr Poettering to float his theory that the EU would undergo a change in its nature if Turkey were to join it ?
I on my part have also been very frank to the rapporteur about the fundamental lack of religious freedom in Turkey .
Let me address those of us who are in favour . By being so , we are committing ourselves to joining with civil society in Turkey in ensuring that Turkey becomes a country free of every kind of torture .
I believe that the so @-@ called privileged partnership is a false prospectus designed to drive Turkey away from integration with Europe .
Mr President , this is an extremely important report that comes at a time when the leaders of the Member States have still not put the finishing touches to the conclusions from the weekend summit .
I shall not detail them here , but I shall merely say that it is only by means of a privileged partnership that we can create strong ties between the futures of Turkey and Europe , without compromising either the European Project or Turkey &apos;s historical role between Europe and Asia .
For many years Turkey has been our neighbour , ally and partner .
For the first time in the history of the European Union , there is widespread public opposition to the accession of a state .
That is not without its problems . I must remind the Commission and Mr Rehn that , among the problems that exist , is the practical matter , to which I have very recently drawn attention , of union recognition in Turkey .
In other words , we are showing double standards as regards further European Union expansion .

We parliamentarians should take the opportunity to put this message across clearly before 17 December because , should full accession prove unattainable , there must be other means of integrating Turkey into European structures .
In fact , it has always been the case even in the past that such serious situations would lead to a suspension of negotiations .
At the same time , the Europass is intended to give future employers within the European Union an overview of a young person &apos;s experience and qualifications .
The only way to secure these goods is to generate the necessary resources to that end , and therefore to secure economic growth .
Mr President , the ALDE Group supports the Lisbon process as the best way of achieving a competitive European economy and it maintains that sustainable economic development has to be a guiding principle in all future regulatory initiatives .
Turning to foreign policy , its scope has to be broader than Turkey and North Africa , Mr Barroso .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , the economic policy guidelines for the European Union &apos;s strategy are laid down in the Constitutional Treaty .
Secondly , I should like to ask the new Commission to hold back as regards the ratification of the European Constitution .
Thirdly , make Europe more competitive in line with Lisbon and Barcelona , and take initiatives to remove from the internal market all barriers , blockages and distortions of competition .
The public also expect us to offer practical solutions to the thorny questions relating to immigration , asylum and security .
The new Constitution requires greater political solidarity , and it is impossible to ensure credible consolidation of the Union on the basis of this new Constitution whilst simultaneously refusing or indeed reducing economic solidarity .
That is how Europe progresses - by enriching its heritage , by building and renewing a dynamic consensus and by seeking to show the world those qualities that make it so different .
As far as we are concerned , they are holy .
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Gargani ( ) on the proposal for a Council regulation on financial and technical measures to accompany the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro @-@ Mediterranean partnership ( MEDA ) ( Codified version ) .
. The International Fund for Ireland , which was set up in 1986 , with the aim of helping to implement the Anglo @-@ Irish Agreement , of promoting economic and social advances and of encouraging contact , dialogue and reconciliation between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland , has done extremely useful and positive work in promoting economic and social development towards peace and reconciliation in the region .
I should like at this point to restrict the focus somewhat and also issue a challenge to Parliament &apos;s leadership .
It goes without saying that the European Union needs to save money .
On the Structural Funds ?
This is confirmed by the European Union &apos;s declared wish and growing ability to be able to participate in conflict prevention and crisis management activities - and of course the challenges are not decreasing .
Because 19 billion pounds of it goes to the inefficient common agricultural policy to support inefficient French , Italian and Greek farmers .
We must protect our long @-@ term development programmes if we are to have a chance of making a constructive contribution to the work on achieving the millennium objectives .
I would like to make two brief points in finalising the official answer to the question tabled .
We urge you to table a clear position about where you want to take this Europe .
The new Commission has taken over the old Commission &apos;s proposal , or what is known as the Prodi package . This means a significant rise in expenditure .
It is a matter primarily for Member States to ensure that the point you have validly raised is more widely known , along with the problems that arise from unlicensed and illegal copying .
It explains clearly , should there still be any need to do so , that Member States are responsible for financing this public service and for defining its remit , and that it is not for the Commission to decide whether a programme should be broadcast as a service of general economic interest or what the definition of the remit should be .
Only a few weeks ago , the Presidents of Rwanda and of the Democratic Republic of Congo concluded a new peace agreement , only to be at each other &apos;s throats again a few days later .
There you are ; I am of course willing to discuss the matter and to revise my opinion , but I think there are already enough controls , especially so far as my portfolio is concerned .
And you know that they will have to be increased .
I would welcome the views of Members on the possible loss of those paragraphs .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , asylum is not a technical issue .
Our report , which has been adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , is therefore based on the need to fight drug trafficking , organised crime and terrorism and to give priority to saving lives and protecting health .
. Mr President , we are today discussing Mr Catania &apos;s controversial report on the European anti @-@ drug strategy , central to which is the fight against drugs rather than the promotion of them .
In countries such as the Netherlands , too , the attitude has changed over the last ten years .
Firstly , cross @-@ border trade is of course ensured .
There will be stricter conditions for the training of drivers and a ban on transporting pregnant , sick and wounded animals .
This would mean that , throughout their periods of office , neither Parliament nor the Commission would be given an opportunity to improve the conditions of animals , a state of affairs that is quite unreasonable .
Satellite monitoring is cold comfort for the animals .

Mr President , I shall present the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety on behalf of Mrs Hassi .
Extending the zone of prohibition would add insignificant protection and would therefore run counter to the principle of proportionality .
That is particularly the case regarding agricultural aid .
Mr President , I will be very brief .
Finally , Mr President , I thank you and your excellent staff for all the cooperation through the year , and wish you a Merry Christmas .
In future , these shall no longer be permitted to receive any funding from abroad .
The issue is this : since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994 a large group of extremist Hutus have been hiding in a remote area of the Congolese rainforest in the east of the Congo .
We need to know just how Dow Chemicals can close the door on what was one of the worst industrial disasters in this century .
As Ernest Hemingway once said , &apos; never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; it tolls for thee . &quot; It is to be welcomed that the European Parliament is concerning itself with regions of the world that are far removed from Europe , and that it is doing so without regard to the requirements of political interest .
In this context , I should like to congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work .
It is also proper that a constitution should include a description of the constitutional structure of the European Union , and I think it is particularly successful in this , talking as it does in terms of national identity .
It is a European &apos; no . &quot;
Economically speaking , Europe is - still - a global player .
Consider , then , the great disaster that we now have to deal with : we need better information and warning systems , and Europe has the technology to provide them .
Fifthly , it strengthens the EU as a community of states , nations and citizens , based on common values and solidarity .
For that , though , they need real information rather than just the one @-@ sided propaganda celebrating the Constitution .
Again , no final decisions have yet been made , but a step has been taken in that direction .
Such a ban contradicts Article 314 of the European Community Treaty and Article 53 of the Treaty on European Union on the true equality of the European Union &apos;s official languages , as well as European Community Treaty Article 5 on subsidisation and Article 151 on the limits of cultural policies .
It is of no use in terms of free cooperation , and it is not clear , for no one can know and understand what the Constitution says .
I think that this Constitution , although it is a compromise , has , in terms of quality , been a considerable step forward .
- Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President of the Commission , the new Treaty is a positive step from an institutional point of view , as everyone has pointed out .
This Treaty brings the EU closer to its citizens .
Why are so many people , at least in my own country , Britain , so frightened of the word constitution ?
The European Constitution is therefore an act of both political transformation and moral transformation .
The European Union has now also recognised and enshrined the task of the regional dimension , namely local and regional authorities .
Today &apos;s report stresses the need to clearly distinguish every point in the Constitutional Treaty that differs from existing treaties .

What is the point of agreeing common laws across Europe if one does not want those laws to be applied across Europe ?
Indeed , these factors give rise to the sense of insecurity experienced by our fellow citizens and , in combating them , we must not confine ourselves to reactions in strictly military or policing terms .
I would however like to thank Commissioner Frattini and his staff for their efforts in continuing work on this issue , above all because employment is by far the best form of integration we can offer our citizens , as has been brought to my attention in many conversations with groups and individuals affected .
These efforts are continuing and the Commission will continue to defend the Community interest .
However , turning to his reply , one of the biggest hindrances to cross @-@ border trade and protection of the country of origin principle is the idea of a one @-@ stop shop for registration of a company , that is if one Member State approves a company to provide that service in that Member State , it should be reciprocal in all other Member States , because the same basis for decision @-@ making under the internal market rules should apply .
On 9 December , at the time of the adoption of the initial action plans for the new European neighbourhood policy , the Commissioner responsible for external relations and European neighbourhood policy stated that his objective was to create a circle of friends around the enlarged Union &apos;s borders .
The Commission has a real impact on integration policy and a direct role , for example , in the enforcement of existing directives , which are crucial to integration - I refer explicitly to the Employment Directive and the Race Equality Directive .
It is true that the draft Constitution is not perfect , but we must not benchmark it against perfection ; we must benchmark it against what Europe will need in order to remain an example to the world in the future .
The strategy must be there for the long haul .
Secondly , we must not forget the question of competitiveness .
My Group will call upon you to specify new arrangements for the Stability and Growth Pact , which underpins the single currency .
It follows that a last presidency - which is what this one is - must be a good one , and one whose successes will stand the test of time .
I hope that this symbolic visit will go some way to improving transatlantic relations , which have been somewhat strained recently .
But now we understand fully what the EU is really all about .
I should therefore like to warn you against such simplistic proposals , which will get us nowhere .
We have shown how crucial it is to ensure sound and effective interinstitutional cooperation .
Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner will go to the region in the coming weeks to further assess needs and to put more flesh on this proposal .
Given figures like those , our donations cannot provide any practical aid unless we cancel the debt .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Constitutional Treaty represents significant progress in the process of bringing Europe together , and that is why I voted in favour of it .
I believe that the draft Constitution entails the EU &apos;s going from being a form of intergovernmental cooperation based on treaties to being a state based on a Constitution .
I have often criticised the break with the EU &apos;s best practice , the source of its success : the &apos; small steps policy &quot; of Schuman and the founding Member States , which is increasingly being trampled underfoot by a ferocious desire to stride forward , regardless of the feelings of the people .
Who authorised the security staff to interfere with free and peaceful expressions of political opinion outside this House , and on what authority was this done , having regard to the Rules of Procedure or any other relevant authority ?
One is that it is very important to use military and civil resources as soon as possible - as the United States has done - in this disaster .

It is to be hoped that the measures that have been planned will succeed ; I am thinking here of , for example , the installation of satellite @-@ based early warning systems - to which Members have referred - to prevent disasters .
The President of the Commission this morning announced that it would be submitting to the next General Affairs Council proposals for improving this instrument .
Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner will brief the Committee on Foreign Affairs on this visit on 25 January 2005 .
The disaster has also shown , though , an urgent need for closer cooperation between us . A friendship must be able to cope with criticism and plain speaking .
Europe and the United States share the same values , democracy , human rights , and the free market economy being among them .
There can be no doubt that these relations are no longer exceptional , as they were during the last century .
A number of creditors have not yet done anything about relieving the debt .
Anyone who thinks that this would cripple the rich industrial nations should take note of the fact that the Iraq war costs the USA USD 150 million every day .
There also remains much to do as regards considering debt relief for the countries of Southeast Asia hit by the earthquake and tsunami .
As I said to you , the Council will follow very closely the implementation of the legislation that has not yet been definitively adopted in Turkey .
They will be interviewing all the persons involved in it , and will then submit a report on it to the President .
What also matters at the moment is that we give active support to those in Ukraine who really want to carry out reforms .
And of course , I also support the proposal made here for Ukraine to become a future member of the European Union , but only if its citizens so wish , of course .
The European Union must help Ukraine to overcome these risks , we cannot lose this opportunity for historic change : economic assistance , investments , but above all trading opportunities .
I was deployed in a rural area about 80 kilometres from Kiev and saw , as any individual observer does , only a microcosm of the story across the whole country .
This point was made explicit to the unions at the time , as the minutes of meetings show .
The money saved will make it possible to create more jobs , as it cannot be denied that the EU is an over @-@ generous employer .
Secondly , there was the question about procurement restrictions .
I visited Aceh and the city of Banda Aceh six months ago .
I therefore vehemently oppose those who try to turn allies into opponents or rivals .
I am pleased to hear Mr Mann &apos;s comments .
I regret to say that this list does not include the Declaration on the Rights of Women .
Like the Council , which adopted conclusions on this issue at the end of 2004 , the Commission is of the opinion that little progress has been made in the past two years , despite the commitment made by the Government of Iran to strengthen respect for human rights and promote the rule of law .
In circumstances such as these , millions of women and children are forced into life @-@ threatening work and tricked with promises of legal employment .
Mr President , Mr Schulz is right ; all our words and all their consequences are of enormous importance .
Abu Mazen &apos;s election as President of the Palestinian Authority has given fresh impetus to the relaunch of the diplomatic process in the region .
It was this right that Hungarian revolutionaries sacrificed their blood and their lives for in 1956 , and a very valid and extraordinary historical and emotional political cause is needed to infringe this sacred right .
Five Turkish Cypriots are very strongly suspected of being the assailants in this case .
Three problems have arisen in the Community cereals market .
It is worth sacrificing another of the EU &apos;s principles that is in any case frequently violated , namely the principle of free movement of workers , for the sake of this principle of solidarity .
Goodness gracious me !
Renewed involvement in the peace process in the Middle East and revitalising transatlantic relations are also key objectives .
For my own group , our priority is to complete the single market , especially in the area of financial services .
The Commission must be as efficient as it is requiring our businesses and citizens to be .
This principle , the implementation of which is mandatory , has already given rise to concerns relating to the provisions of the REACH Regulation and the services directive .
We are therefore seeking specifically to ensure that these concerns are taken into account , since we believe them to be legitimate .
Our discussions gave me a sense of the mood in Porto Alegre .
They are not increasing because of a scourge which has merely come out of the blue , but rather because the policies being implemented over recent years in the fields of structural adjustment and of reducing public spending have led to increasing inequalities and poverty and to increased deterioration of the environment and of the planet as a whole .
In 2003 , 11 000 new millionaires were created in India , while 8 million people were unemployed and 50 million lived on less than a dollar a day .
I have received six motions for resolutions to wind up the debate pursuant to Rule 103 of the Rules of Procedure .
I also join with António Costa in calling on the Commission to put forward proposals based on the principles of mutual recognition of decisions and of minimum harmonisation .
By evaluating special procedures and best practices .
You are aware that the subject of temporary custody , or detention prior to conviction , is one in which people &apos;s rights to freedom have to be weighed against the state &apos;s right to prosecute criminals .
Liberalisation must take place within a framework that guarantees the status of gas and electricity as a public good .
Again , thanks for the opportunity and thanks again to Mr Evans and all those who have been involved in the preparation of this report .
The rapporteur seemed to suggest that there was some misunderstanding about this , but that is how it comes across .
However , we ensure that this financing is really necessary and does not lead to undue distortions of competition .
According to the evidence , the euro zone &apos;s problem is not a lack of stability but a lack of growth .
This best practice approach will make it possible , on the basis of successful examples in one Member State , to make recommendations to other Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , we are discussing the Lisbon strategy and how Europe is intended to become the most competitive region in the world .
A few years later the Iron Curtain fell .
They do so in this House , however .
I support my colleague Mr Karas &quot; excellent report ; we must not play fast and loose with confidence in the euro .
This new proposal should meet the following requirements : the level of financial resources will need to be adjusted if there are to be two cultural capitals as from 2009 ; the present level of financial commitment ranges from EUR 200.000 and EUR 1 million per project .
.
I could cite more figures and examples , and , indeed , the Members of this House have not hesitated to do this during the course of the debates .
The environment and health report is topical .
In order to avoid any ambiguity , I would suggest , Mr President , that , each time we vote on these amendments , you indicate that they are amendments that form part of Mr Purvis &apos;s oral amendment .
In view of this , we choose to vote against Mrs Prets &apos;s report ( A6 @-@ 0017 / 2005 ) - the &apos; European Capital of Culture &quot; event for the years 2005 to 2019 .
If it turned out at some point in the future that funding were to be taken out of the agriculture or regional development pillars , we would have hundreds of thousands of mayors lined up here to complain , and there would be little hope for the NGOs or for you as Environment Commissioner .
Regulations for the 2007 @-@ 2013 financial perspective now need to be strengthened for the integrated approach to work .
It is in all our interests that Natura 2000 should become a workable system .
Mr President , I support the concept of integrating care for the environment into other policies such as the structural funds , agricultural funds and so on . However , anyone who cares for the environment knows that the Member States cannot necessarily be trusted to make integration work .
The bottom line is this : if we are to improve the public health of the people of Europe , we must ensure that adequate budgets are put aside to deal with such problems .
The European Union of 25 members is registering an increase in regional and social differences , something that is directly reflected in people &apos;s quality of health .
Far from wishing to encroach upon acquired rights , we seek to reinforce them .
Training for learner drivers is also constantly improving , and countries are learning a great deal from each other .
Examples of these are when a company is being wound up , when its managers have been involved in proven misconduct , or when tax or social security obligations have not been fulfilled .
According to a joint declaration from the German and French Governments , it appears that at present plans could be made so that the project will be finished by 2010 .
Different provisions exist across the EU for the use of headlights during the daytime , and in some Member States daytime running lights are mandatory on all roads , Sweden for example .
Thank you , Commissioner , for your very direct and clear answer .
Given the forestry industry &apos;s great economic , social and environmental importance , what measures will the Commission take in support of that industry in those areas of Sweden affected by the storm ?
One of the points that concerns me is the cost of licensing for young people in particular .
That is therefore why all the amendments are acceptable to the Commission , and I have no doubt that the formulation proposed by the Grosch report opens up the prospect of a fruitful debate in the Council on this replacement of licences already in circulation .
Before turning to the agenda for today , which relates essentially to relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean region , it is my duty as President to provide the House with information on the meeting that took place yesterday in Brussels .
In trade and economic relations , we should reconfirm the 2010 target for free trade ; agree a roadmap with a timetable for free trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products ; decide on a timetable for the liberalisation of services ; accelerate south @-@ south free trade - the Agadir process was very important ; use the neighbourhood policy to help partners to eliminate obstacles to investment ; and hold a meeting of transport ministers to extend transport corridors to the Mediterranean with the financial support of the EIB .
I urged them then , and I urge them again today , to take part in the parliamentary elections on 17 July .
That is my question to the Council .
Ten years have passed since the start of the Barcelona Process , but we must continue to foster it , so that the citizens of the countries on the southern shore do not feel that an enlarged Europe has forgotten their problems .
The other side must make an effort too .
This cause is fundamental to us , yet we have to be mindful of the public &apos;s consternation at the presence on the Commission on Human Rights of countries that are known as the biggest violators of human rights and that are in fact among the worst dictatorships in the world , such as Cuba , Saudi Arabia , Sudan , Zimbabwe and China , along with others that have serious human rights problems , such as the Russian Federation , and we all know that this does not apply solely to Chechnya .
The Belarussian people are denied the right to independent information as well as the right of political parties to conduct their affairs freely and the right to freedom of assembly .
I hope that the officials will correct this situation , so that I can sit in a place more suited to my humble station and Mr Cavada can occupy a position appropriate to the dignity of his office .
One of the most important priorities is the reform of the judiciary .
In the EU of 15 , only 8.5 % of European citizens enjoyed this professional benefit .
I have been continually stressing the need for that for a long time now .
Decisions on these issues fall within the competence of the Member States and should ultimately be taken primarily by individuals and not by politicians .
The final example I should like to mention is Zimbabwe .
The organisation noted shortcomings in the context of local government elections held in May and June 2003 , including abuse of administrative resources , heavy bias of state media in favour of the incumbents and the arrest of prominent candidates .
- Ladies and gentlemen , since the Orange Revolution , the European Parliament has been paying more and more attention to its neighbours in the east .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
. Mr President , when we talk about hunger , we are also talking , and this seems to me to be obvious , about agricultural policy .
Poverty and misery feed injustice and despair , and these feed global insecurity .
We need to find additional and alternative sources of finance .
The implementation and expiry of the Agreement on Textile and Clothing form an integral part of the results of the Uruguay Round concluded in 1994 .
It is unacceptable to leave 177.000 companies and 2.7 million workers in the European textile sector out in the cold .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , some years ago the British Commissioner responsible for international trade was asked : &apos; What should be the minimum market share that the textile sector in Europe should be guaranteed ? &quot; The reply was : &apos; None , if the market is pushing in that direction . &quot;
We are working on a very comprehensive strategy .
In the action plan , the Council invited the Commission and the Secretary @-@ General and High Representative to present appropriate proposals , within their own fields of competence , on the creation of a European Union rapid response capability enabling us to deal with future disasters .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , I am referring to places such as the Isle of Man , the Channel Islands , Andorra , Monaco , San Marino and others - places that are hardly independent countries or , if they claim to be so , they still rely entirely on the goodwill of the European Union for their continued existence .
It is important to note that the common position has incorporated many of Parliament &apos;s amendments , notably the definition of vulnerable consumers , the participation of consumers &apos; associations in drawing up codes of conduct , and the inclusion of a definition of undue influence among aggressive practices .
Harmonisation must not lower standards of consumer protection , which in some EU countries are very high .
On this basis , I very much welcome the fact that this draft report has been the subject of extremely detailed discussions , not only within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , but also with representatives of the Commission and of non @-@ parliamentary institutions .
The reference to gender mainstreaming in paragraph 14 is welcomed by my group .
Without the necessary financial backing to promote worker training and awareness activities regarding the risk of accidents at work , many of the initiatives that have been considered could not even be implemented .
In a few weeks &quot; time I intend to propose that the Commission should adopt a communication on the European Union &apos;s general strategy for the management of restructuring and an ambitious programme to enhance the potential for economic renewal and make provision for related problems .
How can that not be seen as an arrogant way to behave ?
It should therefore cut its greenhouse gases either by investing in new technology or by purchasing emissions rights .
It seems to us that the crucial question relates to the doubling of expenditure on the research programme within the overall EU budget .
The time for delivery is now .
This would be a sure @-@ fire way of creating jobs , and it would mean that progress was made with all aspects of the European dream .
Commissioner , you have my full support in obtaining the Council &apos;s agreement with the help of this House .
Parliament and the Council have already welcomed and encouraged the initiatives taken by the Commission , in particular the measures aimed at rebuilding the sector in the areas concerned .
How should we handle distribution and allocation ?
My other concern is about the cost of transport .
- Mr President , I would like to propose an oral amendment in relation to Amendment No 7 presented by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , on which we will vote next .
I saw boats ruined and lives devastated , but I saw nothing to make me believe that discarded , old , unwanted European vessels would be of use to them .
. The EU and its 25 Member States must endeavour to look upon the forthcoming 61st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as a further opportunity to put into practice the stated and repeatedly reaffirmed values of the EU and each of its 25 Member States .
If so , was it made in conjunction with paragraph 88 ?
The question that needs to be asked is why not one prime minister in recent years has managed to hold free elections , and the answer is that agreement has never been reached between the various parties , not to mention with the Maoists .
So , this small country is very significant for regional security .
That is what happens in Liberia , established in the nineteenth century as a colony where slaves freed in America could return to their African roots .
Ladies and gentlemen , last Thursday , the Conference of Presidents of the Political Groups unanimously adopted a statement on the situation of journalists in Iraq for me to read to you today .
Last Thursday , when we had a special meeting with the rapporteur , all the committee members signed an oral question .
This was seen recently with the death of the Kurdish child , Ugur Kaymaz , which was covered up by the Turkish police .
In April 1997 , he was arrested , acquitted , suddenly condemned to lifelong imprisonment in further appeal six and a half years later and is now awaiting the Court of Cassation &apos;s verdict .
This being the case , there would be grounds for lowering that share of EIB loans that the Union guarantees by means of the Guarantee Fund .
Last week I took part in the annual meeting of presidents of multilateral development banks and I was pleased to find that in several respects the EIB now serves as a model for other international financial institutions .
Not everything has to be adopted and made binding in law , and we should wait and see how this process progresses from now on in .
The industry itself has always expressed great interest in voluntary agreements , and would like to make a public show of its sense of responsibility .
The Commission has proved in the past that it is ready to take action in this field .
I think it erroneous to take the energy and oil firms &quot; windfall profits as a pretext for distracting from one &apos;s own responsibility for renewable energies , and for that error the Socialists and Communists in this House must bear responsibility .
At the time , my response to all this was rather cautious , for it was unfortunately impossible for the Council to fully implement all the things in this package of measures that Parliament had thought up and asked for .
From this perspective , Amendment 20 , which wants it made clear that air traffic controllers will be subject to the social jurisdiction of the country where they work , is quite crucial .
What is this debate about ?
We must be aware that the problem of gender equality is not just a problem for women , it is a problem for both women and for society as a whole , and we men must be more involved in the task of resolving it .
Nevertheless , in the absence of approved indicators and relevant statistical data on women and armed conflicts , I am unfortunately not able to say whether the 40 % quota has been respected or not .
We have waited a long time for this Gender Institute , yet you had not one word to say about the topic of gender budgeting .
- Mr President , women continue to be the main victims of discrimination , unemployment , violence , poverty and social exclusion and are barred from holding key positions in decision @-@ making bodies and political authorities .
Pay differentials vary from 6 to 30 % for the same work .
One of them is the demographic ageing of society , another is the balance between family life and working life , yet another , mentioned by several others here , is a deeper understanding on the part of our men within the framework of ordinary social customs .
What is needed is a push in a different direction , and the one this report will give will be a big one , and in the right direction .
In point five following Recital M , a reference is very properly made to participatory democracy .
First , the GSP will be simplified .
It offers trade benefits to the countries that are most in need of them .
The amendments to the legislation further promote non @-@ discrimination and competition and clarify basic principles .
While there is an appearance that currently the United States economy is doing better than the Continental European economy , it would be far too simplistic to attribute this to higher working standards in the European Union ; I remain convinced that higher social standards will lead to better productivity in the long run .
Finally , there is the risk - and that is a new threat - of nuclear technology , or even nuclear material , ending up in the hands of what we refer to as non @-@ state actors , in other words terrorist organisations , which could , for example , by means of a &apos; dirty &quot; bomb , do an awful lot of damage .
Today it has clearly misled world opinion , making contradictory statements .
I also take the view that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to speak to you about the situation in Lebanon on behalf of my colleague Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner , the Commissioner responsible for External Relations and the European Neighbourhood Policy .
Given the seriousness of the situation in Lebanon , I hope that the Council and the Commission will deliberately obstruct those forces in Syria , Lebanon and Iran that do not want to know of a fully @-@ fledged Lebanese state sovereignty , or like any political settlement between Israel and its closest Arab neighbours .
We should not delude ourselves : the resignation of Karami &apos;s puppet government and the announcement that Syrian troops are to be redeployed represent just one stage in the process .
Today , Hezbollah &apos;s activities are not so much directed against Israel ; rather , they are targeted responses to individual actions taken by President Abbas in pursuit of peace .
Quality of services should be guaranteed and simple access to dispute settlement must be available .
I await your proposal , not your son of Bolkenstein proposal .
What does the Commission intend to do about this ?
I respect the political philosophy of people who have looked at things differently from me over the years .
The Commission was informed in a letter of 10 February 2005 that as of 9 February 2005 , in the wake of a landslip affecting the RN @-@ 134 at Vallée d &apos;Aspe ( European axis E @-@ 07 ) , vehicles of over 3.5 tonnes are not being allowed to use the Somport tunnel between Spain and France . This tunnel is the only crossing @-@ point for public passenger and goods transport in a 200 @-@ km stretch of the Pyrenees .
. Since the United States is applying the tariff band for pliers that it negotiated in the Uruguay Round , it is in complete compliance with its current World Trade Organization obligations .
In that light , the Court is also subject to the scrutiny of OLAF , which carries out systematic investigations when it is informed of serious suspicions of irregularity , fraud or other illegal activities within the European Union institutions .
The situation in Lithuania is also clear : the Accession Treaty calls for the closure of the Ignalina reactors .
Commissioner Mandelson made it clear this morning that the Commission &apos;s aim in bringing forward this revision of the GSP was to ensure better targeting of trade preferences to benefit the least developed and most vulnerable countries , simplify the GSP system and make it more transparent , improve access to the GSP system by improving the rules of origin and encourage good governance in the countries that benefit from the system .
My essential concern remains , however , how we can communicate to the public the Community &apos;s nature as something founded upon the rule of law .
We look ahead to budgetisation . We hope that will come soon .
- ( Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that almost everything which needed to be said about the work of the ACP @-@ EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly during 2004 has already been said by previous speakers , following the excellent report submitted by Mr Bowis .
I should like to say very clearly - and here the rapporteur has my support - that if we are to be credible in our ongoing arguments with the Commission about how to make the best use of Europe &apos;s scant resources , we must also look at how we and , in turn , the other institutions , can achieve the greatest possible effect with the minimum of resources .
The next item on the agenda is the Commission &apos;s statement on planned egg cell trade .
What I should like is for the Commission to take this debate more seriously , for it not to hide behind assurances or behind the resolution .
We need very tough controls , and we need to see those who break the rules tracked down .
However , we will answer in writing the question on the legal implications of the violation of fundamental rights and the position we can take on that .
Therefore less importance should be attached to reports than to an integrated vision of the reforms currently taking place .
All these things we have achieved .
Increased EU funding need not , therefore , result in an increased tax burden .
In the area of eco @-@ innovations , we should like to see more specific initiatives , and we are pleased to note that , finally , industrial policy linked to innovation and aid for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises has been included in the Commission &apos;s programme .
Of course our draft resolution could be improved still further .
The issue of securing greater job opportunities : the fulfilment of this objective requires an increased mobility of the work force .
There is no policy that is more social than policy that creates more and better jobs and creates space for entrepreneurship .
If we want to achieve this united cooperation , but also this involvement , then we have already negotiated the most important hurdle to succeed .
As to whether we are capable of achieving that aim , the answer depends on what we do and do not do .
The revised version of the Lisbon strategy sets fewer goals , while attempting to categorise these goals , and gives clear priority to economic growth and greater competitiveness .
We believe an internal market in services must be established and that it is , at the same time , possible to resolve any problems to which the implementation of that directive might give rise .
The Doha Round is , indeed , an important ongoing step towards a more open and fairer world economy and , as the rapporteur proposes , that understanding must be present in the GSP .
I am therefore glad that the European Parliament , as stated in its motion for a resolution , believes that a competitive and sustainable European economy is conditional upon the use of sustainable energy sources .
Projecting an image of disharmony between institutions or conveying a tentative or pessimistic message on the future of Europe would inevitably have a negative effect on public opinion , something particularly dangerous at a time when the constitutional treaty is going through the ratification process .
Thank you .
He added : &apos; We are not excluding the scenario of leaving the Pact as it is ; that is now a distinct possibility .
If we continue like this , nothing will be achieved and we will resign ourselves to keeping the Pact as it is , as something more or less nonsensical .
We sometimes seem to lose sight of what has been achieved through the Stability Pact .
The situation is Kafkaesque . The charges against them are unfounded , as researchers have shown .
- Madam President , I should like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council what the Council intends to do to protect minorities , given that the violently expelled Serbs and Roma have not yet returned home .
Those involved in such expressions of racism need to know that they will be punished , but also that they are putting at risk the continuation of sporting events .
My two other questions do not relate to the legal position , of which I am well aware , but to the steps you intend to take in response to accusations that you are a secret society .
To achieve these aims , I call for the Marie Curie actions to be strengthened , as they have proved to be effective and to encourage mobility in the scientific world .
I have , however , expressed my doubts both about the potential overlap with the remit of other European coordination bodies and institutes and about the funds to be devoted to setting up and running the Council itself .
The announcement will need to be backed up by appropriate funding for science and research , which means that no cuts should be made to the EU budget .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there is a French proverb that says that &apos; he who grasps at too much loses everything . &quot;
I should , however , like to make it clear that I do not share the view of Mr Lundgren , who is unfortunately no longer present , that the measures taken to date have barely provided any European added value .
Do you not think that , in the absence of an opinion from the Court of Justice , and in view of the European Parliament &apos;s negative opinion , the automatic transmission of passenger data to the US authorities violates European citizens &apos; right to protection of their private lives ?
This is an issue to be watched very carefully .
I myself have not received any report on the outcome of the inquiry , but I confirm that I shall inform Parliament of it as soon as possible - within a few weeks , I expect , and no later than a month and a half from now .
For new Member States like my country , Hungary , it is not easy to secure money , but we are committed to doing our best to save our unique and untouched natural sites .
The Natura 2000 network is one of the best moves made since the Union &apos;s inception .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on 21 February the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , by 31 votes out of 35 , adopted a common position on the reform of the common organisation of the markets in sugar .
That is what the representatives of the ACP countries and of the LDCs are asking for , and this is fully reflected in our resolution .
As it is industry that uses most of the sugar , approximately 75 % , price cuts would hardly be reflected in the consumer prices of manufactured products , but would mainly constitute a benefit to the sugar industry .
A large price cut would place ACP and LDC countries at a competitive disadvantage in relation to countries that can produce sugar at a very low world price , notably Brazil .
I sometimes wonder - and I think it is positive to highlight this in the debate - how it is possible that he should first want complete freedom and then believes that the solution will materialise from the chaos on the world food market .
I thank you for your attention .
Let me just mention the main points that we have to keep in mind .
Those issues need to be factored into the WTO negotiations .
The next item is voting time .
On this World Women &apos;s Day 2005 , I would like to focus attention on all women who go about performing their duties in a perfectly normal way .
Interest in the non @-@ proliferation of nuclear weapons is hypocritical , unless it is linked to a demand for immediate specific action to destroy them , starting with the European nuclear powers ( France , Britain ) , and unless a clear request is made for US nuclear weapons to be removed from Europe .
In fact there are a great many sources of information and statistics showing that Europe has been suffering from a massive haemorrhage of its best scientists and researchers .
Their situation should not , however , be remedied through a less far @-@ reaching reform of the sugar market .
I could remind the House of the case of East Timor or of the cases of Kuwait and Iraq with which we are so very familiar .
Having at the time been on the rapporteur &apos;s staff , I still remember the counter @-@ arguments to the effect that independence for the Baltic states would never be possible , that this was utopian fantasy , that the Balts possessed no right to self @-@ determination , and so on .
The responsibility for defending the Belarussian nation and its right to genuine independence , rather than a semblance of independence controlled by Mr Lukaschenko and his cronies , rests on our shoulders .
I would kindly ask you to forgive me .
I welcome the enactment of new codes of judicial procedure and criminal procedure and the establishment of a standing committee to investigate complaints of torture and a national programme to eliminate poverty .
No amendments have been proposed .
Mr President , I wish to raise my concern that the Irish Government is not fully respecting the minimum legal and humanitarian standards for the reception and processing of immigrants and asylum seekers that have been established by the European Union .
The European Commission tells us to wait .
We wish to ask the Council how matters now stand regarding its proposal concerning data retention , since Commissioner Frattini announced to us that the Commission wished to present its own proposal .
I hope that we shall soon be able to make progress , both in the European Parliament and in the Council , on the issues relating to the legal basis .
Before the issue of data storage is debated , it is time to discuss whether such measures make any sense at all .
Do they feel that this , too , is an issue for each individual Member State , or does this area urgently require a common policy covering the entire criminal justice system , in other words , encompassing the stage of serving prison sentences and indeed sentence adjustments ?
Mr Frattini has the floor again .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what happens to people who are charged with a criminal offence , not in their own country , but in another EU Member State ?
Thirdly , its Governing Board can adopt only a provisional establishment plan and draft budget , in any case until such time as Parliament , in December , adopts the overall Budget for the coming year .
If the political will is there , we will agree .
The Regulation must also include a new category covering light commercial vehicles under 3.5 tonnes .
Therefore , I welcome Parliament &apos;s proposals to require new vehicles to be fitted with digital tachographs at least from 2006 .
We also need fair competition among hauliers , and we need to consider those hauliers and their working life .
I do not want exhaustively to list here all the obstacles that I stressed in my report , but I would like to point out to you two main issues .
Mr President , I would obviously like to respond very positively to this new offer of dialogue , made in the report by Mr Navarro , whom I would like to thank once again .
The substance of our messages was well received .
Our economy has stalled since the Lisbon Strategy was launched in 2000 ; it is almost as if a millennium bug of continental proportions has afflicted our competitiveness and depressed our determination to take tough decisions .
The Luxembourg Presidency can pride itself on a success which was by no means straightforward .
It appears that at the moment , the Council sets great store by giving this social dimension greater prominence , given the debate surrounding the European Constitution in France , even though there are more appropriate arguments that could be used against this Constitution .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at its latest meeting the European Council recognised that there is very little to show for the Lisbon Strategy at the half @-@ way stage .
What we are being told is that , in the Europe of 2005 , the unemployment rate is going to rise and there is going to be economic stagnation .
As chairman of this Parliament &apos;s delegation for relations with the People &apos;s Republic of China , I should like to say something to the President of the Council about lifting the arms embargo .

Thank you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council and Mr President of the Commission .
In Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden &apos;s reports , and also in the recommendations , we want to have a reference to the exchange of letters between you and the President of the Commission on the full association of the European Parliament in the forthcoming process over the next 20 months concerning safeguard clauses .
In addition to congratulating the citizens and their current government , which has achieved this result , I should like to recall the major commitment made by previous administrations , particularly the government of Ivan Kostov , which started negotiations with the European Union in the early , most difficult days .
. Owing to the lack of progress under its previous socialist Government , Romania is still finding it very difficult to be ready in time for EU accession in 2007 .
This is evident from the current impasses in decision @-@ making and the suspicious attitude of various &apos; old &quot; Member States towards &apos; new &quot; Member States on matters such as the services directive . In consequence new Member States have insufficient opportunity to benefit fully from the Internal Market .
According to the amendments tabled by Parliament , shipping emissions would be reduced by 80 % by comparison with the year 2000 , whereas the Council &apos;s position would only serve to reduce them by 10 % .
Action must be taken that enable them to stay in employment for longer and to take greater advantage of education and training opportunities , and overall improvements must be made to the way our senior citizens are integrated into society .
The two previous speakers have already referred to the need for Albania to ensure at long last that the forthcoming elections are conducted properly and that the results are not manipulated in any way .
However , there have been many very positive developments in the Balkan region in recent times .
It is not absurd to tell these countries to find the way to reconciliation , because we ourselves set an example of such reconciliation sixty years ago .
The fifteen months which have passed since then obviously do not allow us to draw up a complete and exhaustive report on its implementation , but they do at least enable us to evaluate the impact which the strategy has already had , and to discuss the path we need to follow in its future application .
This is where the EU &apos;s unique collection of instruments puts it at a comparative advantage , but , if we are to work efficiently , we need to deploy them all - civil , military and sectoral - in a coherent way .
The European Security Strategy is the timetable for European foreign policy for the coming years and decades , albeit one containing very many questions as well as good answers .
This originality is above all that we want to take responsibility for both the civil and the diplomatic and military aspects of such a policy .
We would also do well to remember that the principles drafted concerning the safeguarding of our security in the broadest sense can constitute an excellent starting point for dialogue with our American partner , and a basis for the creation of a new kind of transatlantic relationship .
- The debate is closed .
I believe that it is the responsibility of the institutionsto promote this idea .
That is an essential requirement for closer relations with the EU and I think that , in the previous debate , I did emphasise this once again .
Who is coordinating and supervising this work ?
The employees - and we must congratulate them for this - have developed a plan based around the concept &apos; let us create the European champion in clean combustion . &quot;
I believe that the WTO should act . I urge the Commission to take up the case .
Instead , they are simply required to notify the relevant authorities and provide them with a single sheet of information and a list of expatriate workers .
Not only did enlargement result in many economic benefits for the new Member States , it also led to enormous economic benefits for the Union as a whole , particularly as regards potential benefits .
The first of these is inconsiderate , short @-@ sighted and sets little store by competitiveness .
Automobiles are , in the EU , regulated to an extraordinary degree .
In 1998 , the European Council invited the Commission to submit a Community support plan to combat doping in sport .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , according to the Committee on Culture and Education the Athens Olympics demonstrated that doping in sport is a genuine threat .
Consequently , the question of the relationship between international trade law and the future UNESCO Convention is a key aspect which should be approached in the best possible way and which must on no account be given a lesser priority .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , aside from a few misgivings and concerns , the resolution appears positive to us insofar as it has to do the job of expressing a common position .
.
In this context , in the event of any loss of income suffered by fishermen due to temporary suspensions or fishing restrictions arising from a recovery plan , provision must be made for fishermen to be offered financial compensation aimed at offsetting any consequent loss .
However , I cannot agree with the idea of setting a TAC according to an annual increase in the quantity of adult fish in the sea .
Now that that balance has been struck , I voted in favour .
There are three sets of instruments that are of particular importance in assisting Portuguese farmers .
Things are already disastrous , hence the major importance of the proposals on which we are voting today .
Paramilitary groups , which claiming to fight crime , commit acts of torture and murder .
We are talking about a commitment made by the parliamentary delegation that visited the camps a few weeks ago , and which we are now fulfilling .
I would like to emphasise that , thanks to the essential role of the &apos; buffer stock , &quot; created and funded by the Commission in 2000 , we have been able to avoid any interruption in food supplies .
The Italian Government is not respecting those norms by any measure , and I would urge the Commission to insist that the Italian Government - and indeed any other Member State , if it is in breach of these norms - be hauled before the European Court of Justice to ensure that these laws are respected .
May I simply say that the European Union is first of all a community of values , a community of values , incidentally , which is better rooted in the draft Constitution , especially through the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I shall end , Mr President , by congratulating the rapporteur and expressing my hope that this Parliament will vote for this report tomorrow morning by the large majority it deserves .
The freedom of expression and the right to information from varied sources has become a joke in Belgium ; this is completely at odds with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This embargo has no real effect , of course , but it testifies to our moral beliefs , and we should act in accordance with such beliefs in this instance .
There is often a conscious or subconscious concern not to be too explicit , not to be too hard , not to irritate people even if they are wrong .
A binding legal framework has been established by the EU with the aim of combating discrimination on the basis of race or ethnic origin , and Community regulations currently in force prohibit direct or indirect discrimination in employment , education , social protection , property matters and services .
Many Roma citizens residing in my country have an identity card - when they do have one - that bears the address of the Travellers &quot; camp and , in parentheses , &apos; Roma Camp . &quot;
We must ask ourselves who is to defend this nation , as the answer to this question would be a starting point from which we could find a solution to the problems .
Mr President , I must protest most strongly at the alarming censorship carried out by the European Parliament in preventing the screening of the film in the Press Room on 20 April .
In the worst @-@ case scenario , the result is an avalanche of data , with which the authorities concerned cannot cope .
The EU should also be informed of the situation with regard to health care .
It should be a free , quality service provided on an equal footing to everyone by the state alone .
Finally , I wish to make a comment on Amendment 7 , which underlines the need for reliable information and comparative data and the need for a systematic collection of data across the Member States in the field of health and safety at work , with the support of Eurostat .
Our key priority for the next 12 months is to complete unfinished business in the area of financial services .
Their volumes and growth of dynamics exceed many times those of classical financial operations involving real production , services and consumption of products .
They are wrong to do so , for the package of measures needs to be implemented in a very short space of time , and the internal market is not yet complete .
There are examples of travellers being required to have travel insurances with only Russian insurance companies .
This is another reason why I cannot vote in favour of this report , even though , or perhaps precisely because , I hold both Polish and American citizenship .
So if we can save a child &apos;s life , until we have some other way of doing it and killing the mosquito in question , we will have to allow controlled use .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , water is life , and groundwater is our main source of fresh water and hence also of drinking water , providing as it does 60 % of the latter .
We know how complicated the study of groundwater is , and we also know that , once a body of water is polluted , it remains so for years .
Either the Nitrates Directive should be repealed or compliance with one should remove the other from the equation .
I know it is not directly an issue for the Commission , but how can we stand up here and wax eloquent about water safety and about water being essential for life - on which we all agree - if we continue to allow a Member State to pollute the public water supply with fluoride ?
Research contained in the report concerning transposition of the directives by individual Member States , and in particular by the new ones , is surprisingly encouraging .
We must do our best in order to bring about change , instead of political bluffing ...
In particular , I would like to highlight the progress of Lithuania , the country where I have been elected to the European Parliament .
Mr President , may I ask whether you were in the habit of addressing Ian Paisley as &apos; Reverend &quot; in the days when he was a Member of this House , and whether the reverend gentleman would have been expected to stand when addressing the Chair ?
The precautionary principle must be applied with regard to protecting groundwater against pollution , and this is currently laid down in Directive 80 / 68 / EC , until 2013 .
Rarely in parliamentary debate is that necessary , and rarely do political groups have to allow their members the freedom to decide in accordance with their conscience .
These are the reasons why I was unable to vote in favour of a report containing such provisions .
With the peace , or at least with the end of the war , on that 8 May , certain political leaders proclaimed that the flag of freedom was flying over the whole of Europe , but today we must acknowledge that , at that point , the end of the war only brought peace and freedom to half of the continent .
In all cases , discrimination is inexplicable , especially in the case of Hungarians , as we were also victims of the same Stalinist oppression .
The next item is the Commission Statement : Justice for the McCartney family .
My group supports the justified demand that the murderer or murderers surrender to the police and that the witnesses should make - whether to the police or to the ombudsman or to some other body - statements that will stand up in court and help ensure that the murderer is punished as he deserves to be .
Time is running out for the peace process and that is why we need to maintain our pressure on those responsible for the murder and cover @-@ up because , unless we resolve this issue , the peace process will fail completely .
It is still not too late for the Sinn Féin leadership to rectify this failure , provided it has the commitment to do so .
What will be the value of this directive , therefore , if it does not offer the same guarantees of safety and quality of water for new types of nautical activity such as surfing , windsurfing and kayaking , which have become - as we all know - common currency in many bathing waters throughout the European Union ?
I also consider it significant that recreational activities are excluded from this directive , the absence of which will lead to the disappearance of surfers , and kayak , windsurfing and waterskiing enthusiasts , etc. from our holiday resorts .
Mr President , the Commission can accept a range of amendments concerning the provision of information to the general public , both at bathing sites and over the Internet .
How is it that it is an Eastern European country , an Eastern European government , that is pushing this issue forward ?
I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has indicated a willingness to consider high levels of aid in the next review of the cinema communication .
I believe that the present recommendation is just the beginning .
That is a good way of going about it ; it is always important to get the backing of political leaders .
I am personally very much in favour of giving such priority to cross @-@ border sections .
Certainly , as someone pointed out , money provides the backbone for this effort . We must therefore ensure that our political priorities can also be translated into budgetary priorities .
With regard to the proposal of the Council and Parliament to additionally subject cargo ferries to checks , I , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , take the liberty of pointing out that a greater number of checks at ports would also make it possible to stem the trade in counterfeit goods , drugs trafficking and a long list of activities carried out by criminal organisations .
We can therefore endorse Amendments 13 @-@ 75 , but unfortunately not Amendments 1 @-@ 12 .
An opt @-@ out from a piece of health and safety legislation is wrong in principle .
On @-@ call time in the workplace should be regarded as working time , and employees should be paid a flat rate for on @-@ call time outside the workplace .
The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties ; the Commission proposed 10 years ago that the opt @-@ out should exist .
Calculating working time on an annual basis is a compromise solution , but it will have consequences , unfortunately , for low @-@ income workers relying on overtime in peak periods .
In conclusion , I should like to thank Parliament for the high quality of the debate that has been held on this proposal .
Afghanistan &apos;s social development indicators are still dismal : we have one of the infant mortality rates and one of the life expectancy rates in the world ; and we have unacceptable levels of illiteracy , particularly among women .
Within this text , we see no freedom for States to freely set the taxation of purely localised activities , such as catering , which have no bearing on European competition .
.
Here too , then , there are lots of opportunities for the future and scope for being imaginative .
Climate change derives from a two @-@ fold shortage : the physical scarcity of energy resources and the inability of the ecosystem to absorb the flow of waste .
Progress in the reduction of emissions in the EU has come to a halt , as the easiest action to make cuts has been taken .
In a very large number of cases , these actions are implemented through specific demobilisation , disarmament and reintegration programmes .
Research is being carried out in Europe today , not only to ensure that the arm can be traced , but even to disable it remotely .
And finally , &apos; there are no indications that high @-@ denomination banknotes encourage illegal transactions . &quot; Which planet do they live on ?
. - Mr President , the first question concerns Libya , and I can briefly say that the Commission &apos;s first report on Libya , which I set out to the Home Affairs Ministers precisely on 14 April , as Mr Catania has mentioned , highlighted some worrying factors .
I should also point out that DG Sanco is carrying out an ongoing review of the Package Travel Directive , which will also deal with this issue .
The first responsibility of the present Commission is , therefore , to connect with citizens . Let me add immediately that this is not just the Commission &apos;s responsibility .
The formats can include not only drama series , game shows , films and news reports but also debates .
The Commission is , therefore , ready to examine the possibility of introducing a degree of flexibly in the definition of the scope of use of the funds in the phasing @-@ in regions .
I should first like to take the opportunity to thank you and your services very much for the prompt response that you referred to .
Questions Nos 49 to 85 will be answered in writing .
Unfortunately , however , this principle is not always adhered to , as can be seen from the huge number of complaints received by both Parliament &apos;s Committee on Petitions and the SOLVIT system .
What I considered crucial , and that has also been adopted by the Commission and the Council , is that a liability scheme will in any case be put in place , particularly for the medical professions , because it is unacceptable for people employed in that sector on a temporary basis to be able to escape all disciplinary provisions and liability because of the temporary nature of the job .
If it cannot be channelled directly to producer organisations , then the budget that is left over , in the light of major frost damage in large parts of Europe and other natural disasters , including drought , can still be spent in the sector in order to ensure that it survives these difficult times .
It is of crucial importance to coordinate market measures ( first pillar ) with rural development ( second pillar ) .
Accordingly , the Commission will consider carefully the creation of a mutual stabilisation fund based on public and private co @-@ financing .
In common with the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I do not believe that two years is long enough to allow us to assess the developments that have taken place in the market for starch following enlargement , and it is my opinion that unfilled quotas , which currently stand at 19 % of the total , should be shared out between the new Member States .
With this oral question , which will also be followed up during this part session by a compromise resolution by the main political groups , we want to ask the Commission how much humanitarian aid there is and what it intends to do with it over the course of this year , and what schedule of commitments the Commission intends to promote for Darfur and for Sudan in general .
It is for this reason that I echo our motion for a resolution in saying that I welcome the UN Security Council &apos;s decision to mandate the International Criminal Court to examine the situation in Darfur .
In this regard , the example provided by the latest review of the International Development Association ( IDA ) is revealing .
Unfortunately , the EU seems to excel in poverty creation in pursuit of its own agenda : for example , paying cash to Mauritania , Angola and Mozambique for the right to fish out their coastal waters and impoverish their fishermen ; or economic partnership agreements under which the European Union tries to buy poor nations &quot; acquiescence to its protectionist policies .
In my initial speech I spoke about those memorandums of understanding , those trust funds , by means of which we take action , combining the resources of the World Bank with the budgetary resources of the European Union in a whole series of activities and regions of the world , whenever we consider that those actions are in line with the objectives set by the European Union and with our priorities in the field of development aid and our policies for supporting development in the poorest countries of the world .
From a political point of view , energy has become a security issue .
Current events in Kyrgyzstan cannot be viewed in black and white terms , even though some Western observers appear to wish that this were the case .
The first of these is a deterioration in the political situation and an erosion of human rights and civil liberties .
Any observer will recognise that the path we have taken over the last 15 years is littered with undeniable , some would even say spectacular , successes .
It would still be possible to add the qualification of master craftsman to a higher @-@ ranking category , however , by including it in Annex II of the directive .
The implementation of this report could damage our attempts to try to retain and possible create jobs without eroding the social model .
When , therefore , the proposal concerning the opt @-@ out - a rule , moreover , that is not applied in Sweden - was voted down and the proposal to calculate average working time over a period longer than four months was rejected , I thought it right to vote against the proposal as a whole .
Let us recognise that something remarkable came out of the ruins of Europe in 1945 .
In this hour , we remember all the victims of the Second World War , and all the suffering and destruction .
. Mr President , I was born one month before 1945 .
The Gulag Archipelago continued to expand , and the number of lives it claimed can be compared to the number of Soviet citizens that fell in the war .
Nowadays we regard their heroism as the most powerful testimony to human spirit ever seen , and one of the moral foundations of the Europe that we have built .
The evil empire created by Stalin was unacceptable , even though before then the victory over Nazi ideology had been jointly celebrated .
When can we expect these two regulations to be passed ?
I believe that it is a duty shared by all the States from the moment that they become members of the European Union .
Article 159 ( 3 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides for specific actions to be adopted outside the funds in order to implement the economic and social cohesion objectives set out in the Treaty .
We will have to work in close collaboration with Mr Wolfensohn &apos;s Office , and we will have to examine whether the European Office offers the appropriate framework to enable this cooperation to actually materialise and to be as effective as possible .
I would like to stress as important aspects of Parliament &apos;s work in 2006 , first a better explanation to EU citizens of the European Parliament &apos;s work , placing particular emphasis , in this connection , on the role of the European Parliament &apos;s information offices in the EU Member States , and second , preparations by the European Parliament to play a larger role in the legislative sphere , as provided in the EU Constitutional Treaty .
We should call on the Secretary @-@ General to present the Bureau with a proposal to modify the internal rules on recruitment adopted by the Bureau on 3 May 2004 , to enable political groups to benefit from the same recruitment provisions that apply to Parliament &apos;s administration .
What matters , after all , is the content of what will be said when the telephone rings .
We are in favour of incorporating this service in the Commission &apos;s remit , on the provision that the Council determines how the intergovernmental competences are fleshed out .
The working party &apos;s position was that , ideally , he should consult the Commission about his initiatives , and get it to support them , from the very outset .
In the field of development , we must ensure that the negotiations deal with the problems linked to poverty , malnutrition and hunger in the world , with a view to reducing them by half by 2015 , as laid down in the Millennium Declaration , by means of a closer relationship between the WTO and the other international organisations .
The discussions surrounding the access to the market in industrial products and services are at a standstill , as are those concerning the rules .
There can be no question of changing the European agricultural model or the Luxembourg agreement on CAP reform .
However , the final agreement should not bring into dispute any aspect of the recent reform of the common agricultural policy and should safeguard equivalent commitments for all trading partners .
I think that is something to celebrate and applaud and it is something , in my view , that we should build on rather than condemn .
I welcome this , but I also believe that the effects need to be felt quickly if they are to stay our hand in any action that we might consider taking .
The response to the challenge posed by China needs to include a thorough reassessment of the assumptions that have underpinned international trade theory up until now .
Europe &apos;s response will be crucial and will act as a benchmark for future crises in other sectors .
Furthermore , it is not applying in full the principle of national treatment .
Also , there is a mixed picture developing in terms both of the impact of import levels on particular commodities and categories of textiles and of the impact on production levels and employment within different parts of the European textiles industry .
So it is that , further to what Commissioner Wallström so rightly said , there are a number of things I would like to demand of this House .
I welcome the appeal to European Union institutions for an improvement in the conditions for accredited journalists and the working relations with them , since the high costs mean that particularly newspaper and television houses in smaller countries cannot afford direct coverage and reporting from the sessions of its institutions or training for their journalists so they might have a greater familiarity with the working of the European Union .
It is obvious , moreover , that only a system of decentralisation can facilitate access to information for a greater number of Europeans .
Throughout the region , there are sound reasons why we are active in demonstrating our concern and why we are channelling all of our political efforts into creating a large democratic area that is characterised by freedom and respect for human rights .
We all feel the widespread revulsion at the horrors of World War II , and feel the need to recall what the human race , communities and individuals were capable of doing .
This will be complemented by an interinstitutional strategy aimed at strengthening the EU &apos;s image and at stepping up cooperation between the Commission and Parliament , in order to make the best possible use of human and material resources .
- thirdly , that there is no overcompensation of the damage caused .
As a result of this disaster , much of the land will go uncultivated and will be liable to end up as mere desert .
Today , we believe that the utmost priority is the re @-@ establishment of calm and stability and the prevention of any further violence .
Alarmingly , independent journalists have been harassed for a considerable period of time ; three of them were murdered in 2001 , many others have been intimidated and their papers forced to close down .
UN diplomatic measures are also needed .
We have a major problem not only with translations , but also with interpreting , and often have problems with deadlines if reports of this kind cannot be translated and processed in good time .
Does he agree with me that it was particularly discreditable for Mr Poettering to bring such pressure to bear on the British Conservatives , given that we were elected on a manifesto commitment to oppose fraud and corruption ?
Mr President , on behalf of the Democrats and Liberals in this House , let me say to the signatories of this motion of censure that they are being ridiculous .
However , I know that in the future you will recognise it depends very much on who is asking the question , and then you will decide whether or not you should come .
This revision has taken place in a climate of excellent cooperation under the direction of the political authorities of both institutions .
Yet this report itself accepts those same deficient procedures .
There is no alternative to active cooperation , but we need to focus on a number of practical areas of cooperation in which the EU and Russia both benefit from results .
No one could fail to be alarmed at the bill presented by Mr Dmitri Rogozin to the Duma , which , if it is adopted , will make it possible for Russia to incorporate whole new regions into the Russian Federation without anyone &apos;s permission .
Let me read in particular condition 24 , in which the EU &apos; asks Russia to reaffirm its commitments to the territorial integrity of Georgia and Moldova and to withdraw its military forces from Georgia and Moldova in accordance with the request of these sovereign states &apos; . And rightly so .
I have to say , though , to Mr Laschet , that there are two things he should not do . For a start , you should not share out the bearskin among the nations before the bear is dead .
I agree , in fact , that it should participate in the agency &apos;s governing body - this is a symbolic aspect , but also an important one .
If the agency adheres to these guidelines , there is every chance that it will play a valuable part in protecting European fundamental rights , a task that - after all - falls to all of us .
Briefly , he helped deliver a boat to Morocco ; several months later people using the boat were arrested for drug smuggling .
No one would dispute the need for this instrument in the fight against terrorism .
At present , there are thousands - perhaps even hundreds of thousands - of alerts of suspicious transactions every year across the EU .
Our main priority is that we should work together towards this goal and use the time remaining until 2007 to present a separate programme . We need to understand - and this is a point I should like to make to Commissioner Špidla and the House - that women are watching us .
In future , these programmes will be combined in the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme .
There is an agreement between Japanese , European and Korean car manufacturers not to fit rigid bull bars .
In another Member State , additions are permitted only if it can be proved that they are necessary for a balanced and adequate diet .

After all , we already have a law that protects consumers from misleading advertising .
In order to defend its position that a claim need not be based on a product &apos;s real nutrient values , the Committee has used the same argument as the food industry , namely that there is no such thing as good or bad foods , only bad diets or customs .
In particular , I would refer to the inclusion of a positive list of allowed nutritional health claims .
I regret I cannot accept Amendment 6 .
Nevertheless , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has tabled this oral question to the Commission to ask it to play a more proactive role .
It is no coincidence that the Nordic countries provide a high level of social and environmental protection .
Growth alone is a guarantee of neither solidarity nor social sustainability .
It also failed to take practical measures to promote and evaluate progress in the area of equality between men and women , for example as regards access to jobs with rights and salaries , where the situation is as bad as , if not worse than , it was .
I think we have better things to do than to promote controversial research .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the need for us to do something about our economic , social and environmental policies is not a matter of doubt ; it is because some things need to be changed if the good is to be maintained that we need to adapt all three of these policy areas to the new demands made upon them , thereby enabling risks to be minimised and opportunities seized .
Given the complete lack of respect you have shown during Mrs Lulling &apos;s speech , I must call all the honourable Members to order .
.
We must ensure that a balance is struck between freedom and security , and that we do not have one at the expense of the other .
This new agency will only be worthwhile if it can make up the shortfall in data collection mechanisms and if it can keep track of trends and processes that have not worked in the Member States .
Mr Juncker , we place our trust in you .
The entrepreneurs have highlighted the fact that Chinese producers do not include employer contributions to insurance and social security schemes or money spent meeting environmental standards in their production costs , and that this makes it possible for them to charge significantly less for the goods they export .
The rules in force establish where and how this Parliament should meet and our obligation is to comply with the rules in force , which say what they say about where the European Parliament should meet .
The report is , I think , a good one , in that it clarifies our need for more trans @-@ European energy networks if we are to achieve the Lisbon goals , which have to do with making our continent more competitive .
The proposal also provides for Member State regulators to improve their distribution tariff structures when possible , in order to promote energy efficiency .
It would be tragic and hypocritical if a knee @-@ jerk reaction against making anything mandatory at a European level were to be allowed to be jeopardise that commitment on climate change .
Some of the speakers mentioned that we have a different situation , one country has done more , another less .
It also means reinforcing systems for monitoring and managing the structural funds .
Consequently , I ask Members of Parliament to support all the efforts we are now making to simplify the rules and proposals so as to make the financial system more transparent , simpler , visible and easier to follow and control .
The Council &apos;s short @-@ sighted attitude is regrettable , however , because , on the one hand , it has confined itself to environmental applicationsand , on the other hand , it has made little use of the Commission &apos;s coordination capacities .
I am sure Mr McCreevy is be aware how good his staff can be .
I am very pleased to inform you that the Commission can fully accept all the amendments in the report adopted by the committee .
In this regard , I believe that it is they , at the end of the day , who are in the best position to provide added value for local products .
The resources proposed by the Commission and in the Presidency &apos;s compromise proposals will not result in a stronger rural development policy , which will give new opportunities and will introduce innovations so that the rural sector can approach the Lisbon targets .
As my amendments on the subject were not accepted , I must not of course forget to make clear that beekeeping is also farming and that beekeeping , which is very much at risk , also deserves proper support in rural areas .
Member States are requested to confirm or to modify their current delimination in their programmes .
The best way , therefore , to limit this fear is for us to be ready , as Europe , both to prevent terrorist attacks and their repercussions and - if a terrorist attack ultimately occurs - to be ready to deal with the repercussions of the attack in the best possible way , in other words by mitigating them both for the population as a whole and for the victims .
.
You are aware that , following the 2005 bioterrorist attack using traces of anthrax , a high level committee for public health safety was set up with an effective programme of cooperation for prevention and rapid response .
This priority under the Hague programme should also be at the heart of our policy .
The protection of individuals &quot; personal data is not guaranteed by the Council &apos;s proposal .
We need to give more incentives , more opportunities to these nations in order to reduce fundamentalism , in order to reduce terrorism .
It goes without saying that our national investigating authorities must cooperate more closely .
Firstly , there is a very close balance between individual liberty and security and we have to be very careful when we deal with it in relation to terrorism .
The proposed blanket scheme does not give any proper criteria that would meet the Convention on Human Rights .
That is why this threat of biological , nuclear and chemical terrorism deserves to be given increased attention by the European Union .
.
The electoral defeat of the Aznar government in Spain , which was considered to be hostile to Islamists , just days after the attack carried out by Moroccan immigrants on 11 March 2004 , formed part of this strategy .
It is also true that the very weak growth in national budgets , which must not be overlooked , inevitably has consequences for the European budget .
Hard choices would have to be made if this proposal were accepted .
We should also ensure that savings are made .
In our view , the first key requirement is to fund the policies covered by the Lisbon agenda : the trans @-@ European networks , research , university exchanges and the knowledge @-@ based economy .
Our group does not share the committee &apos;s view that the grand total for expenditure should be the Commission &apos;s original proposal of something between 1 % and 1.14 % .
Mr President , there can be few subjects closer to a Scotsman &apos;s heart than money and , as the only Scots representative on the Temporary Committee on the Financial Perspectives , I have watched the often Kafkaesque debates with much interest - even when the real debate appears to be happening elsewhere .
The only response to this crisis has to be the good news that Europe is capable of looking to the future with hope , and that Europe itself can be the source of such hope .
In consequence of a Council decision , funding is tied up until 2013 in the first pillar , where , however , resources are inadequate for funding Romania and Bulgaria .
We regret that the 1 % has replaced the ideas by percentage , but , on the other hand , it has also relaunched the debate on the urgency of fundamentally reviewing the system of own resources .
I would above all , therefore , like to give credit to Mr Böge for having , with great wisdom and balance , produced a sensitive report that required complex analysis and has resulted in effective political proposals .
The rapporteur proposes less than the Commission , but more than the Council has proposed this afternoon .
As a result , what we now ask the Presidency - whilst congratulating it on its determination and whilst telling it that we want a compromise and that we are here to help it reach that compromise - is to reach a compromise that is closer to what Parliament will , I hope , vote for tomorrow , and also closer to the Commission &apos;s proposal than to that from certain Member States , even though we recognise that they do have real difficulties that we must not underestimate .
I am unable to tell you whether that particular system is considered , as one might say , exportable , that is , reproducible on a large scale for a European Union of 25 .
. That is a very reasonable supplementary question .
What we now know is that if you have a new @-@ born hearing screening programme , you can give new hope to those children , real potential for them and my plea is that the Commissioner finds a slot within the seventh programme to develop that knowledge further .
The report by my colleague , Mr Moraes , points out the importance of fundamental rights and , in particular , of the protection of minorities in an enlarged Europe .

With regard to the first , you are all aware that the proposal that was drafted by myself and approved by the Commission gives particular prominence to integration .
Secondly , we must work for the full integration of immigrants , since that is the only way we can prevent rootlessness , marginalisation and the conflicts which , to an increasing degree and with greater frequency , are arising within our societies ; an integration which has a dual meaning -- for the society of destination and for the migrants themselves -- but which , in any event , must be an integral and fundamental part of our common policy .
I also think that , with the elements and amendments introduced by Parliament , we now have guarantees regarding respect for human rights and the protection of personal data .
Maintaining guide levels or , where considered expedient , making provision for a study assessing the existing levels or their replacement with new guide levels , would in my view be the proper way forward .
There are many ways in which people who face delays in their own country can be helped .
The right to see a doctor abroad has already been recognised by the Court of Justice , and , as Mr Bowis rightly suggests , why not enshrine it in European legislation ?
This is not solely about them as a commodity , but also about quality and clear definitions , about a legal framework and the clarification of who pays and who gets what .
In this field , we owe it to ourselves to demonstrate that the EU is able to respond effectively to the citizens &quot; expectations .
A plan D to listen to the people ; a plan through which the European and national institutions devote themselves to an exercise of listening to and debating with the citizens and civil society , in order to deepen our analysis of a complex situation .
This comment is directed particularly at me , for nor did I .
Yes , Mr Schulz , the crisis of confidence between the citizens and the European institutions has been continuing to widen and deepen since the great liberal watershed of the single market and of the Maastricht Treaty .
It is the of which Philippe de Villiers is President , the . In 1992 the voted &apos; no &quot; to Maastricht , but it voted &apos; yes &quot; to the Constitution .
It is now time we did something positive with those voters .

For too long , some of our governments have turned their backs on the emergence of a real European culture .
I think that the people of Poland , the Czech Republic , Luxembourg and Denmark should have the right and the opportunity to say whether or not they want the European Constitutional Treaty , and only then , on that basis - as provided for in the Constitution - should the Council decide next year what to do with the document .
I believe , Mr President , that when you go to the European Council you will be listened to because you have conducted a very useful debate .
We were told that it was too soon .
We also support the idea of a correction mechanism to compensate those countries that , under the present system , account for a disproportionately large proportion of the EU &apos;s income .
In that way , it will be possible to direct people &apos;s choices so that these are environmentally more friendly .
. - The report &apos; on the protection of minorities and anti @-@ discrimination policies in an enlarged Europe &apos; contains everything except the basic fact that the discrimination in the EU against women , young people , ethnic immigrant minorities , the disabled etc. is the result of the anti @-@ grass roots and unfeeling policies of the ΕU , on the one hand , and has a very deep , class @-@ based nature , on the other .
This September , in New York , the European Union should send out a clear message to the effect that we want reform and institutions that work better , and that we encourage Kofi Annan to proceed down this road .
In order for something like that to exist , however , a common European foreign policy is required , and I believe that we are still very far from reaching that objective .
This reform involves many important issues .
Additionally , a strategic dialogue on Asia has begun .
Closely related to this is , thirdly , the UN &apos;s reform which will be debated in the autumn .
Inhumane and degrading conditions in certain US prisons must be kept secret .
In terms of development policy - as we have already heard , in part , in relation to the Bretton Woods institutions - the Americans , with the Europeans , can really change course and move towards the Millennium objectives in order to generate a new momentum .
That is odd , since the majority of political parties in Uzbekistan were forbidden to take part in the parliamentary elections .
The excellent work by the enquiry committee , the research work of our anti @-@ fraud services Uclaf and Olaf , the Cigarette Fraud Task Force and the careful cooperation between customs and police services are now resulting in major networks being rounded up .
You are well aware , as I said in my previous remarks , that these are extra @-@ budgetary funds .
Four years after this decision , the measures taken have quite obviously not been effective : the industry continues to sell &apos; alcopop &quot; drinks which are clearly targeted at children and adolescents , and consumption of such drinks continues to rise , with all the harmful effects that this implies in terms of public health .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to return in particular to one of the topics mentioned : the issue of AIDS and HIV .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the political situation in the European Union is too serious to get lost in legal wrangling over the Stability and Growth Pact .
In this respect , I consider the European Parliament &apos;s proposed amendments to be positive , and greatly appreciate them .
It is the basis for getting structural reforms and , at the same time , macroeconomic investment under way .
The Commission is focusing on a sectoral approach : we are pleased about that because it is essential that part of industrial policy should take account of the distinctive nature of each sector in the way it is implemented .
Secondly , emphasis must be given to supporting and encouraging small and medium @-@ sized businesses in the industrial sector .
These polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are classified as carcinogenic , mutagenic and reprotoxic substances .
There is no excuse for us ; we know where benzenes and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons come from .
The Commission cannot accept Amendment 27 , which could dilute the significance of setting a minimum landing size for the species covered by the proposed regulation .
The EU has a quota allocation of about 18 000 tonnes per year and the Commission in its wisdom has , for some years , considered giving Cyprus a quota of just 5 to 10 tonnes , instead of the 500 to 1 000 tonnes needed .
We have also taken on board a number of other amendments from individual MEPs .
Industrial tuna fishing threatens not only tuna fish stocks but also other species , of which the best known is the dolphin .
Of course it is perfectly logical that governments , in line with the principle of subsidiarity , should try to address the majority of problems at local level and the reasoning that most information is always available at local level is perfectly valid .
. - I would like to give my opinion on the work of our colleague , Mr Őry .
We believe that it should be up to individual Member States to adopt positions on possible support for the agreement on the conservation of dolphins .
No , and consequently I have voted in favour .
They highlight the need for the peoples to fight to overturn the imperialist system as a whole and to directly strengthen their struggles and their solidarity in order to repulse the new aggressive plans of the new order .
The measures that are taken all too often resemble a chaotic struggle by public services to respond to problems that have emerged , and that have usually become urgent .
I believe , however , that it is more appropriate to request an adjournment at voting time .
. - Mr President , I would like to congratulate the secretariat of the ALDE Group , to which I belong , for submitting the application so quickly and thus giving me the privilege of being the first to speak in this debate .
For example , the true unemployment rate , despite the oil and construction boom , is very high , being estimated at 20 % to 30 % .
Five regional projects are currently being funded in the southern Caucasus for a total amount of over EUR 5 million .
Others claim that the disagreement is not a failure for Europe because agreements on the financial perspectives are always achieved at the eleventh hour .
The less we invest in political union , the more we - unknowingly , unconsciously and imperceptibly - pave the way , with an implacable logic , for the concept of a free trade area .
But it would be wrong to give the impression that we have gone nowhere as a result of last week .
The referendum in Luxembourg is now , no doubt , going to go ahead on 10 July , and I wish the President @-@ in @-@ Office every success in it .
The only plan in sight for now is clearly the Blair plan .
We should all be ashamed of the way in which certain participants in the summit behaved .
If its architects were keen to hear what the EU &apos;s citizens had to say , then they have achieved their goal .
Moreover , theimpasse surrounding the EU &apos;s multi @-@ annual budget cannot be seen in isolation from the current institutional crisis in Europe .
What is demonstrated not only by this rejection on the part of the public but also by the tactical infighting on internal policies and national egoisms within the Council is that the EU is in a crisis and will not find it easy to extricate itself from it .
The Luxembourg Presidency , in its commendable effort to address them all , has confirmed its own political ability and its determined support for the Community project . It then suffered an unfortunate setback in the European Council last Thursday and Friday , which , without doubt , does not help Europe to build an effective relationship with the citizens , a relationship that is genuinely based on the element of trust .
Let us not therefore wear sackcloth and ashes , be issued with yellow cards or be depressed .
That is the way to re @-@ engage the electorate with the European Union .
My question to the Vice @-@ President of the Commission is this : how does the Commission intend to address citizens &apos; criticism about over @-@ regulation and the excessive technicality of legislative proposals ?
In this regard , the European institutions have a responsibility that they must fulfil unflinchingly , given that the European debate is not merely a sum of national debates .
That puts a bigger responsibility on the other two corners , the Commission and Parliament , but in this debate I have seen that there is a willingness and determination to work together .
We talk of subsidiarity ; let us practise it for once .
Such expressions are antiquated in a democratic EU .
The date of 17 June 2005 will be recorded in European history as a failure .
I should also like to highlight the political value of the fact , which in my opinion is very positive , that for the first time the Members of the European Parliament can follow the codecision process in this domain .
. Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss security research with the House today , and I should like to express my thanks for the recommendations and suggestions you have made to the Commission .
Cultural and linguistic diversity should be one of the driving forces of the progress initiated by the World Summit .
I would propose that the Commission should set up a programme to support small European producers of these new media ; for example , the mobile television .
The question at issue is a question of the European Commission &apos;s rendering proper account to the European Parliament and , consequently of the European Parliament &apos;s rendering proper account to the citizens , more and more of whom are filing petitions .
From examining the documentation , both the breaches of the Commission and those of the British Government , or at least of its so @-@ called supervisory bodies , stand out , but what also stands out is the gap between the interests of the people and the interest of a very restricted number of plutocrats and speculators .
We managed to achieve the first part of the objective beautifully .
To say that this is the issue is to escape the real debate and to hide in the comfort zone of the things we have always said to each other in times of difficulty .
This is modern social policy , not regulation and job protection that may save some jobs for a time at the expense of many jobs in the future .
Given the urgency , it is not reasonable to put everything into question now .

Very good .
Under its own terms the Constitution cannot take effect until all Member States ratify it , which will not now happen .
As far as the British rebate is concerned , Prime Minister Blair recently said in an interview that the United Kingdom would be prepared to pay more , but only if the money went to poor countries rather than rich ones .
Finally , I urge you , as Prime Minister , to continue to take a firm stand in defence of the justified rebate , which you can properly defend on its own merits ...
We should reject the proposal for a common statute , as it would guarantee Members from all 25 Member States the same high salary and pension benefits , even though there is absolutely no justification for this .
On the contrary , what is needed is a Union that addresses the issues that , in the era of globalisation , cannot be resolved by nation states : from foreign policy to defence policy , from immigration crises to the fight against terrorism , to the trade challenges with China .
What about the common agricultural policy , Mr Blair ?
I agree with the agenda he has set out .
This evening I leave for Africa because , like you , I attach great importance to the African agenda and our solidarity with that continent .
Instead , salaries should be more or less the same as those paid in those countries to people in corresponding positions .
It is not enough for foreign nationals wanting to enter and remain in the ΕU for no more than three months to be in possession of the necessary documents , to convince the authorities that they have legitimate reasons and enough money to survive for that period and to give detailed information on where and how they will live ; they must also not be nationals &apos; for whom an alert has been issued in the Schengen Information System &apos; and must not be considered &apos; a threat to public policy , internal security , public health or the international relations of any of the Member States &apos; .
As this level has not been adopted by NAFO I have always felt that adopting this measure would have a detrimental effect on Community fishermen .
Ladies and gentlemen , a terrible tragedy has struck the family of our fellow Member Filip Adwent : as you know , he , his daughter , his father and his mother died in a traffic accident on Saturday 18 June .
With regard to the initiative by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg with a view to adopting a Council decision adjusting the basic salaries and allowances applicable to Europol staff , the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs asks that plenary confirm its rejection during the present part @-@ session by voting for the legislative resolution closing the consultation .
I firmly repudiate these sweeping denigrations of our staff and of the staff of this House .
Clearly , this House would wish to protect the freedom of expression of its Members when they are carrying out their duties and their right to speak freely as politicians , and in this respect we have to consider Rule 9 of our Rules of Procedure .
When I say : &apos; Inflation has been very limited , &quot; the response is &apos; you are lying . &quot;
As President Trichet has just said and as the report says , we must strengthen the dialogue of the European Central Bank , whose independence must be respected , with the Commission and the Council and , in particular , with the Eurogroup .
However , we need to take initiatives both nationally and at European level to counteract the inevitable negative impacts on these reforms .
This is what our voters in France and the Netherlands want , even though they rejected the Constitution ; they still want more political union and the Constitution is one way to achieve this on the economic front .
. Mr President , in one of the first speeches , Mr Klinz said that the introduction of the euro has been a success , and I share that view , as Mr Klinz and this Parliament are well aware , but I also share the concern of those people who have said during the debate that we must continue to adopt clear decisions and guidelines to ensure that it continues to be a success , because it is important to us , both as citizens and as defenders of the project of European integration .
When , in 1999 , the Commission forwarded to the Council and Parliament its proposal for restrictions on phthalates in toys and childcare articles , it did not expect so much time to elapse before this directive was eventually adopted .
It would be preferable if products made from PVC were to be replaced by those made from wood , rubber , ceramics , leather or other natural materials .
The vote will take place on Tuesday .
The debate is closed .
.
The power cuts in recent years have clearly shown how vulnerable we are .
Even though the Commission expresses a reservation on one particular issue , if the directive is agreed on this basis at Parliament &apos;s first reading , the Commission will welcome this directive .
For that reason , I am in favour of the directive becoming law .
Patents are not a sword . Patents are a shield .
The first is the accessibility of patent applications .
Mr President , in the same way that a doctor should not harm his patients , this Parliament should not harm the societies that have elected it .
The threats posed by the unamended directive are as follows . Firstly , that the software market will be monopolised by major players from outside Europe who are powerful in financial terms .
Institutionally , I have a message for the Commission and Council .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the basic duty incumbent upon EU institutions during the legislative process is to enact good , easy @-@ to @-@ understand and effective legislation .
A limited interoperability exception , geared towards the promotion of open standards , could also constitute a sound approach , provided that international obligations are respected .
I have always believed , first as a banker and then as a politician , that the principle of free trade in the economic culture of the Union means being able to speak to the market in the language of the market , but that it cannot mean indulging all of its whims .
Accordingly , we shall be able to conclude the process at second reading .
It even considers that this has been the most successful of the European projects .
There is a danger of children &apos;s interests not being protected and of businesses withdrawing instead of playing their part and investing in regions where there is a risk of child labour being exploited .
Cross @-@ border cooperation already has a rich tradition , and has achieved considerable success over the many years it has been in place .
Our aim during the UK Presidency is to reach a consensus on outstanding technical issues in the regulations as swiftly as possible , so that the package of regulations can be finalised very quickly once the outcome of the future financing negotiations is known .
The Commission would stress that NGOs must have access to activities funded under the European Social Fund , particularly in the case of those organisations operating in the field of social inclusion and the fight against discrimination .
Until now , we have seen that credits have been devoted to simple projects , to the detriment of projects of structural significance .
I believe that the European Parliament &apos;s contributions will be acceptable , in particular the compromises on such sensitive issues as the N + 2 rule , VAT or the statistical effect .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my group endorses the idea contained in the Fava report that the ERDF should concentrate on investments , infrastructures and further development initiatives in selected areas that are a priority for the Community , as it continues to be the case that the whole Community can expect to derive considerable additional benefit from investments of this kind .
A decisive experience for the EU @-@ 10 in the transformation processes of the last 15 years has been the disappearance of national borders , the fact that borders have become ethereal , and the recognition and implementation of democratic European values such as subsidiarity , solidarity and regionalism .
Mr President , the purpose of the European Fisheries Fund should be to implement the common fisheries policy , according to Mr Borg .
For example , Mr Triantaphyllides argued for a greater focus on the poorer Member States , while Mr Allister suggested that the Commission &apos;s proposals would allocate too much to the new Members .
Mr President , it is through our support for Europe &apos;s most disadvantaged regions , particularly those in Eastern Europe , that our solidarity is given expression .
In the majority of the outermost regions , fishing is a very recent business and fish stocks are still abundant .
Regional competitiveness and regional employment , for those are the issues at stake , currently account for some 17 % of the resources of the structural funds .
Aquaculture is made more visible .
Now it is a matter of implementation , implementation , implementation .
Turkey should join in with this , both in principle and in real terms through concrete and visible action by taking steps not only against violence but also towards implementing gender equality in other areas .
. Equality of opportunities between men and women is a fundamental right and a priority in the European Union .
What was needed was for this point to be given greater emphasis , and I regret that this was not done .
We now have a compromise which has wide support across the political groups and , more importantly , across publishing and the journalistic world .
For that reason , Commissioner , I believe that the right approach is for us , jointly with the Americans , to assess the risks to our passengers and share the results that emerge from that , thereby , and together , making the public safer .
Two calls for tender were launched there in March and the project selection has already been completed .
One of the major players in making the rules and ensuring their observance is Parliament .
Expanding sourcing possibilities to all developing countries would result in denying the very concept of cumulation , assuming that most of the supplies used by developing countries to manufacture products to be exported to the EU under the GSP come from other developing countries .
Mr President , before commenting on the characteristics of this project , I would like to express my thanks not just to Mrs Isler Béguin , but also to Mrs Lienemann , the other shadow rapporteurs and the officials and advisors who are working extremely hard to reach a consensus on this project .
That is why Europe absolutely has to display authority in what it wants and why it is crucial to provide for specific funding , inter alia , in Natura 2000 .
In its present form , LIFE + has only been used to shore up &apos; current financial gaps &quot; arising between structural funds and agricultural funds .
To do so , we must defend intellectual property rights and combat counterfeiting and piracy .
We cannot ignore their impatience , and at times anger , which is linked to the feeling of living in an era in which the phenomena of globalisation are in the end governed by the United States , used by large countries such as India and China , and paid for , in various ways , by developing countries and by Europe .
It is both an absurdity and a scandal that the European Union , by going as far as to subsidise those companies that transfer production to third countries , is sawing through the branch on which it sits .
The poorest states in the world are now losing even their textile industries .
I also favour keeping to the position we arrived at on the financial perspectives , as laid down in the Böge Report .
Our displays of concern and commitment to the success of this Treaty are not enough , however .
Finally , emerging countries should be given assistance to develop their internal markets .
These clauses would therefore only be applied if this were really justified , something that does not seem to me to be the case , precisely because the agreement with China covers the most sensitive products , that is to say almost half of the Chinese textile sector liberalised in January 2005 .
With regard to the specific supply arrangements , the Commission is required to legislate for what are often only modest variations in the quantities of products to be supplied in the outermost regions .
The Commission &apos;s proposal suffers , however , from shortcomings and gaps on a number of aspects .
As regards the specific supply arrangements , particular attention should be paid to Madeira vineyards and bananas , to Azores milk and to the special measures designed to help farmers buy agricultural fertilisers and pesticides .
With his indefensible &apos; Operation Drive Out Rubbish , &quot; Mugabe is destroying thousands of shelters in the poor suburbs . All and sundry are being driven into the wintry cold , desperate and not knowing where to go .
That is what I hear , and I believe it .
The developing world has become a den of debauchery for many developed countries .
Ethiopia has already experienced enough catastrophes in the shape of dire famines , wars and civil wars , a dictatorship bearing the unmistakeable mark of Soviet @-@ style communism , followed by another civil war and a war of secession , war among its neighbours and more of the same besides ; it is now heading for a new one .
In paragraph 17 of the resolution , we should like to delete the words &apos; government of national unity &quot; and insert the words &apos; transitional government . &quot;
I request your kind support in this matter .
They articulate the view that EU information material must come across to the public in their day @-@ to @-@ day lives and the environments in which they live , and they believe it necessary that the EU should cooperate across the board with institutions involved in school education at national level in fostering cultural , historical and political awareness .
The Commission has certain such resources at its disposal .
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe under water , Europe under fire , this ought not to be inevitable , yet , unfortunately , it is a recurring theme , and every year we are forced to speak about it .
Fires and floods have happened in the past and will always continue to happen .
Water bomber aircraft and specialist helicopters were sent to deal with Portugal &apos;s forest fires .

This is the issue of mines that have already been closed down and have therefore stopped taking mining waste , while rehabilitation work is being carried out in line with valid European permits .
This dialogue , which mainly consists of exchanging information and points of view , meets with everyone &apos;s satisfaction .
If it cannot , can it tell us what its criteria are for this dialogue and can it give them to us in writing ?
It is desirable , furthermore , to promptly entrust the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) with a key role in checking that the international and Community aviation safety standards are observed , by making it responsible for issuing safety certificates for third country carriers .
In the European Union , we can move towards stricter specifications and enhanced control and prevention roles ; at the same time , without being against the liberalisation of the skies , we believe that , because of this liberalisation , additional controls are needed by national civil aviation authorities and additional controls by your Commission of the Member States &apos; national civil aviation authorities .
In actual fact , it is by means of an overall strategy that we will obtain the required outcomes and that we will put pressure I state this clearly on all of the carriers in order that they themselves also genuinely agree to subscribe to this increased safety effort .
Buying a project , a device , or a system is one thing , but it is just as important to develop one &apos;s own systems and perfect one &apos;s own technology .
The Galileo programme , as Mrs De Veyrac has just said , confirms the European Union &apos;s true independence , and will make possible a number of applications .
I believe that the report that is now before us will receive broad support in this House .
What is put together here on - and let this be borne in mind ! - 42 whole pages , is a burden on businesses , puts jobs at risk and is a cause of justified outrage on the part of the public .
The inclusion of natural light renders , sadly , the sensible proposals within this package unworkable , legally difficult to enforce and practically difficult to manage .
The right - both Europhiles and Europhobes - have used this issue as a wedge in their campaign to renationalise health and safety regulations , ignoring the fact that , in an open , competitive economy , if you do not have European regulation , you will have no regulation .
Social protection systems and social integration do not operate in ways that are entirely satisfactory .
- Mr President , we agree with Mrs Jöns &quot; report - and I wish to congratulate her - because we believe that safeguarding high levels of social protection and participation of the workers , at a time when the rules of the market and of profit prevail , is our urgent duty .
It must also promote the movement of national works in every country of the Union .
. Mr President , having lived most of my life under Communist rule , the rules we are enforcing in the &apos; Television without Frontiers &quot; Directive sound all too familiar to me .
Yet the EU presses ahead with this paranoid , illiberal plan , with its quotas of European programming , and we all know what chaos quotas can create .
There are , in Germany , many businesses engaged in the manufacture of bio @-@ gelatine .
Mining waste is currently covered by general waste directives , but some serious incidents involving quarrying and mine waste led to the Council to ask for a specific directive on mining waste .
They acted and reacted quickly and effectively , as it was their duty to do to safeguard their interests , first and foremost .
That reduction is designed to take account of under @-@ implementation in recent years .
With regard to internal and external policies , our worries become fears : we are not convinced , Mr Lewis , by the symmetry between the funds allocated for commitments , which have been reduced by a lesser degree than the payment appropriations , nor can an analysis of the most significant cuts provide an explanation in terms of the political message that we all want to give .
At the same time , it is very generous as regards European special envoys , whose budget has been set to double over two years .
Europe is getting poor .
It is not enough for our leaders to state their desire to promote citizenship and equal opportunities .
In the same time , only three of them have come close to finishing all the things they undertook to do .
The next item is Question Time ( B6 @-@ 0330 / 2005 ) .
It will provide its staff with specific training in communication skills and recruit communication specialists as well .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission must communicate the facts about EU issues and give people opportunities to make their own judgments and choices .
Although the occasions on which flights are diverted are relatively few , we recognise the concern and inconvenience they may cause .
Finally , in its 2002 communication on democratic control over Europol , the Commission supported the idea of a joint committee of national parliaments and the European Parliament responsible for discussing matters related to Europol .
I realise that it has not been easy to acknowledge the medical viewpoint , requirements and recommendations of the physicians while at the same time respecting the often legitimate claims and demands of the pharmaceuticals industry . But , what bothers me more , is that the discussion about this directive in Parliament concentrated on whether patent protection should last six months , three plus three or four plus two .
I hope that Parliament will look closely at the case that we put forward .
Understanding is needed , but so is determination .
Why has the EU &apos;s antiterrorism coordinator not been allowed the cooperation he deserves from national capitals ?
We have seen the horrors of people dying inside container trucks in ports around Europe .
Mr President , we are seeing a growing and very worrying number of situations worldwide in which states are using the argument of the fight against terrorism as the basis for a policy of repression of other non @-@ terrorist groups , or to violate the most fundamental rights of people assumed to be terrorists .
We must find the means to combat exclusion , in our societies but also in less developed countries , and we must fight against injustice all over the world .
However , the rejection was the result of the feeling of many citizens that their voice is not heard in Europe and denying Parliament a codecision role in decisions of such import obviously does not help .
Thirdly , with regard to intelligence and cooperation amongst information services , which accounts for at least 70 % of the fight against terrorism , I am going to make a single reference to a point Mr Clarke has discussed at some length , namely the issue of telecommunications .
Italy - and I am delighted that the Netherlands agrees on this point - expelled an imam yesterday and is preparing to expel some more people in the next few days .
The case for further data retention has not been sufficiently proven ; the case for human intelligence and for understanding the problem has .
You are right , Mr Schulz : we did indeed include measures in the Constitutional Treaty that would have enabled us to make progress ; for the time being , however , such progress will not be possible .
Mr President , I should like to say something about the Őry Report , starting by saying that I utterly fail to comprehend how a monstrous piece of legislation such as this can spend twelve years being tinkered with in the Commission , the end result being the insight that a piece of legislation on optical radiation is , as it relates to the rays of the sun , perhaps not exactly what the European man and woman in the street expect of Europe .
.
In Iraq , we have also witnessed another important step forward following the publication of Iraq &apos;s constitution as recently as 28 August 2005 .
Unfortunately , the news has mostly been about misery , violence , war , oppression and ultra @-@ conservative rulers .
Following the destruction of a building in Gaza on Monday and the assassination of his security advisor only this morning , Abu Mazen has just demanded scarcely a few hours ago a plan for disarming Hamas in Gaza .
This means that the demands for a European Middle East policy must become much clearer .
The European Union also uses the opportunity to raise issues of concern , including human rights , at the EU @-@ Israel Association Council .
. Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I will start with the warmest of thanks to Mr Queiró for his report , and for his enthusiasm and commitment to foreign tourism , to which it testifies .
I am referring both to the existing regulations as well as for the Commission &apos;s new proposals regarding changes in the VAT regime .
Tourism is a fundamental activity for my country , Italy , and especially so for my city , Rome .
It is as simple as that .
Let the tourism industry agree on its own quality requirements .
The first supplementary question asked , &apos; have I read the question ? &apos;
It is totally unfair to impose an individual condition on Croatia and thereby postpone the negotiations .
. I find myself in concurrence with the points that the honourable Member raises .
Then there is , of course , the question of alcohol , consumption of which is indeed rising at the moment thanks to alcopops , which target and are mainly consumed by women , with the social problems that this can cause .
Similarly , the fight waged by women for the privileges and rights due to them must not degenerate into aggressive and conflict @-@ generating rivalry with men .
We hear now of statistics from Scandinavia suggesting that there are inequalities not only in health status , but also in the response of health systems and health services to women , as compared with men .
Therefore it is right and proper that the European Parliament , as the highest democratic institution in the European Union , should draw attention to this fact and put forward possible measures .
On the one hand , there is enlargement , which the European School system is clearly not yet tackling successfully .
We must not neglect the requirements of pupils with special educational needs and those who receive most of their education in a language other than their mother tongue .

The Norwegian Government has recently produced a very full policy document for discussion on the High North .
Whether it is a matter of the environment , health or culture , everything also has its northern dimension in the same way the EU &apos;s policy on the Mediterranean does .
Russia is a strategic partner of the European Union , as witnessed to by the positive conclusions of the summit of 10 May and by the adoption of the road maps for the four Common Spaces .
Nonetheless , an effective EU policy of tourism to other countries depends on an integrated policy for sustainable European tourism within the European Union .
Mr President , my thanks and congratulations go to the rapporteur .
I am currently working on an idea which would be a kind of ethical label intended for private companies that receive and manage the funds that the Commission grants them within the framework of cooperation .
Otherwise we will unfortunately be obliged to admit that our compassion is often short @-@ lived .
The above @-@ mentioned report addresses many important aspects of women &apos;s health and access to health care .
We must be tireless in making the point that the most important thing that can be done to combat HIV / AIDS is to prevent it , and the statement in the Bowis Report that 2004 saw new and extremely high levels of infection is an indication of a political situation of which this House has been critical for a long time , namely that there is too little funding and too little support to enable preventive measures to be properly implemented , and this criticism is primarily directed at the Bush administration in the United States .
- Mr President , I too should like to take my turn to thank and congratulate my honourable friend John Bowis for the highly comprehensive report which he has presented to us .
Such a situation needs to be put right quickly by means of a serious , tangible and prompt international commitment .
No one present here today can even begin to imagine the agony of those dying of starvation , nor can we understand the plight of adults and children reduced to abject poverty .
Nevertheless , these relations cannot be based solely on improving the commercial relations of each party .
He was detained in his village ; the police searched every house in that village , confiscating any Christian material ; his wife and child have been in hiding ; he has been imprisoned five times for a total of 12 years , during which time he was severely tortured .
The democratisation of Syria now takes priority over closer trading relations .
Could you clarify this please , Mr Schulz ?
There is no legal vacuum .
Commissioner Wallström , you can tell Mr Barroso from me that I will not accept a situation in which the President of the Commission tells the international press what he intends to do , but not the European Parliament .
What can Parliament undertake to do in the coming months to send out to Europeans the positive signals they are waiting for ?
At our seminar last week , we discussed a number of very concrete ideas on how we could engage in that kind of dialogue with Member States .
Yes , there are still many bridges to cross , but today , in my opinion , we have crossed the Rubicon .
In 1940 , as the threat of war loomed , Italy removed from the territory of Slovenian Istria , Koper , Izola and Piran works of art that had been created in those locations under commission from the Church and private individuals . The works were produced by Italian masters .
It was a youth movement that , in practice , was a part of Solidarity and of the huge and positive mobilisation that Solidarity stood for in the Polish society of the time .
He has won many honours from countries and organisations around the world in recognition of his courage and vision , perhaps the greatest honour being his election as Poland &apos;s President after Communism crumbled .
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon .
I might add that many of these deletions have been recommended to the national supervisory bodies .
I believe that they should have complete confidence in the rapporteur .
Firstly , I note once again that the consolidation and harmonisation approach leads to a dead end .
This was also confirmed by the Council when it expressed its support for the overall compromise package of amendments .

Tuna is a much @-@ loved , healthy fish , packed with the Omega 3 fish oil that is so important .
I therefore thank the rapporteur for the work he has done , even though the difficulties that we have encountered and the fact that the directive still does not aim very high are further good reasons - and I really mean no paradox in this - for Parliament to approve the report today and to make this complex procedure continue until the directive enters into force .
Let us remember that Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights relates to the right to dignity .
The definition of &apos; safe third country &quot; has in effect been eliminated , preventing Member States from rejecting applicants deemed unsuitable even if they come from countries considered to observe freedoms and human rights .
Unfortunately , progress has been very slow .
There are formal legal issues with the legal basis , but there are also substantive political issues . I will mention a variety of subjects : the Agency for Fundamental Rights , the data retention question - in other words , topics on which I have proposed that this Parliament should work within a substantive political , interinstitutional agreement , whatever the formal legal bases .

The second phase of the negotiations will begin shortly ; we call on this Parliament to defend the geographical indications more firmly in those negotiations , to which end we must open up a debate on the future of semi @-@ generic terms .
Like the other Members , I am much obliged to her for this statement .
We have therefore agreed to experiment with closing the debate at 11.50 a.m. , so that the debate can proceed without disturbance .
The June List does not share that view .
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Kreissl @-@ Dörfler &apos;s report on the amended proposal for a Council directive on minimum standards on procedures in Member States for granting and withdrawing refugee status ( A6 @-@ 0222 / 2005 ) .
I repeat that we will do everything we can to get support from the Member States for those ideas .
This will contribute significantly towards solving the regions &quot; problems .
- Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to express my sincere appreciation of both Mr Guellec &apos;s and Mr Marques &apos;s reports ; I shall focus particularly on Mr Guellec &apos;s .
Sérgio Marques &apos;s report is very much to the point in this regard .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I share the positive assessment of the two reports that we are examining , which reveal the considerable differences that exist among our regions and show how these differences have become even greater with enlargement .
Mr President , I would like to take this opportunity of thanking Commissioner Hübner for the fact @-@ finding missions that she keeps undertaking in various parts of the Union .
The one thing that is certain is that this Herculean labour will demand that all three institutions work as closely together as possible , and the Commission will inform Parliament as soon as a decision has been taken on the procedures and methodology .
Even though it is not provided for in the Treaty , in view of the interinstitutional agreement , how do you see the participation of our parliamentary committees ?
I did not say that vaccination was not useful .
One had heart arteries which were 90 % blocked .
Things like this do not happen overnight , but are usually the outcome of longer @-@ term processes .
. On the basis of the information available to me I can agree with the honourable Member and , until it is proved otherwise , this particular institute has the highest reputation .
This would also make it clear - particularly as &apos; Olmützer Quargel &quot; is produced in other Member States , too , of course - that this is simply a generic designation .
You pass very swiftly , Mr Barrot , over the fact that the first private train in France , owned by Connex , is not carrying any additional traffic , but is happy to occupy a place held until now by the public company SNCF .
As Presidency , our task has been to deliver on these commitments and we are working hard to finalise the Council &apos;s position in the framework for negotiations in advance of 3 October .
.
Let me tell the House what our group regards as important .
Much has been written on this subject .
Why do the Member States not simply opt for a solid neighbourhood programme with Ankara ?
It does not recognise Cyprus and some people are talking about the Annan plan .
There is an incompatibility between our political Union and the destiny that this great Nation State , which we respect , wishes to pursue on a sovereign and nationalist basis .
We are no longer talking of a European Union , but rather a superstate .
If it is not somehow laid down in black and white that these negotiations are open @-@ ended , and if this House &apos;s minimum requirements , as set out in these two additional amendments tabled by the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , are not complied with , then I am in favour of rejecting the whole report in order , before 3 October , to send a message , not least to the Council .
Certainly , we also expect Turkey to continue to work constructively towards a settlement and support the resumption of the UN efforts .
The next one corresponds to Amendment 778 , the second oral amendment .
It is rumoured that torture is still practised there , violations of human rights persist and Christians continue to be substantially hindered in the practice of their religion , to name but a few reasons .
Turkey &apos;s accession would help to secure better energy supply routes for the EU . &quot; It continues : &apos; With its large military expenditure and manpower , Turkey has the capacity to contribute significantly to EU security and defence . &quot;
The &apos; opening up &quot; of the freight market was already a threat for the public rail services but the shift to opening up passenger services is unacceptable and fraught with consequences for the users and for planning and development in Europe .
The intention behind the Commission &apos;s proposal is to encourage the railway undertakings to achieve an improved quality of freight transport and thus to strengthen customer demand .
The importance of this issue was highlighted by the recent informal Ecofin meeting in Manchester , in the United Kingdom , which , when discussing the current economic situation , focused in particular on the impact of oil prices .
In this respect , let me inform you that OPEC has committed to help to stabilise the international oil market and to contribute to bringing oil prices back to sustainable levels .
In the same way , there is little hope that the oil @-@ producing countries will have a genuine interest in making the oil market more stable or the ability to work together with oil consumers to achieve this .
Finally , Commissioner Piebalgs , what is the situation regarding the European Union @-@ Russia Energy Dialogue ?
We must introduce more rationality and efficiency into the global system , preventing energy wastage that we all pay for - the United States use 50 % more energy per dollar of GDP than the European Union .
Finally Mr Strejček offered what he suggested might be heretical remarks to conclude our debate today .
If the UN is to be effective it has to work collectively with all of its members .

The only problem is the shape that this reform should take .
Mr President , the United Nations evolved from various initiatives to bring the countries of the world together to promote true peace through the recognition of the dignity and worth of the human person and the value of the community - local , national , and global - in protecting the person .
There is , therefore , no question of a single EU seat on the Security Council .
Does the Council consider it necessary to heighten awareness of the problem and provide funding for measures such as the above to protect the environment and health of future European generations ?
The Community will discuss with the third country how the money paid can be used for the benefit of the people of that country .
This is a challenge to the Council .
I think it would be extremely important to ensure that as Mr Lukaszenko introduces charges for crossing the border , the Member States of the Union start to issue free visas to Belarussians , thus making it abundantly clear that Europe is not turning its back on Belarus as its leader maintains .
Aid should be channelled primarily through Polish bordering regions .
I would simply like to remind the Indian Government and society of certain issues such as the following : the death penalty must be abolished , the United Nations Convention against Torture must be ratified , it must sign up to the International Criminal Court and it would also be a good idea to sign up to the Treaty on the Non @-@ Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , as should Pakistan and Israel , by the way .
Above all , it is the people of Kashmir who should be consulted on the future of their region , not just the politicians in Karachi or Delhi .
It is clear that we need to and can do better .
They contribute to a guarantee of sustainability , in that they are non @-@ CO2 emitting and CO2 neutral , and to our energy independence , as well as to job creation in the European Union precisely at such a difficult time , as we have already seen today in the debate on the oil document , thanks to technology in which we are world leaders .
I wish all power to representative Andris Piebalgs , and I would like to thank MEP Claude Turmes for taking a large step in the right direction .
The high level pan @-@ European consortium ...
It is not justified , or fair on European competitiveness , that we should spend so much money on railways , which serve so little purpose compared to the road network .
That is clearly a responsibility shared between the European Union , our Member States and our regions , but also by every one of us .
Do you think the aid we sometimes give to firms , many of which even then are guilty of outsourcing , is sufficient ?
Thank you very much in advance for your answer , Commissioner .
Europe &apos;s two largest groups , H &#91; amp &#93; M and Zara , are proving tremendously popular with consumers .
My own government has in recent years changed its policy and now actively encourages and assists Irish companies to source in the People &apos;s Republic of China and elsewhere .
However , continued innovation and investment in this comparative advantage is crucial .
Bear in mind that not even the EU itself has a common social policy , every State takes care of its employees &apos; salaries , which in the EU vary from State to State , and are very low in some there are citizens living below the poverty level .
That , as well as many other unreasonable factors - forced labour springs to mind , as do inhumane working conditions - result in our markets being flooded by Chinese finished products at prices for which our own companies can sometimes hardly buy the raw materials .
If we could , in fact , conclude the debate in Brussels or next month in Strasbourg and vote in the process , that would be helpful .
It must be said , however , that the UN is an old lady of 60 years of age , whose organisation and way of working seem to have been set in stone from birth .
.One cannot but endorse the objective of reducing the number of road traffic accident victims , which is very high ( 43.000 deaths per year in the European Union ) .
China needs to improve connections between its transport networks and international networks , in order to facilitate the free movement of people and goods .
I would strongly implore him and his government to make progress , especially in light of the Troika next week .
Nevertheless , within this context , on 5 September the National Congress of the Tunisian Human Rights League , scheduled for the 9th and 10th of this month , was suspended by judicial decision .
One factor in the increasing incidence of atrocities may be large @-@ scale immigration of Serbs from Kosovo and Croatian Krajina into parts of Vojvodina formerly dominated by national minorities .
Such a programme should be tabled and the access of Serbia and Montenegro or the access of Serbia alone to subsequent stages of integration should then be made conditional on full respect for human rights , including the rights of minorities .
Hurricane Stan passed through several countries in the region , caused huge material damage and irreparable human losses .
I would like to make it clear that the proposal is to add the names of specific places to this item on the agenda .
Individual financial security is a basic component of culture and peace .
That is because the soft approach to illegals and , obviously , the regulations that result from it , have an enormous effect in attracting hundreds of thousands and millions of other fortune @-@ hunters .
If people are in such dire straits as to think it worth risking death , then our best efforts will avail nothing unless the causes are removed .
Another issue : for the sake of parliamentary courtesy , Mr President , I will not say that what Mr Barón has said about me makes him unworthy and indecent ; I will say that he has used indecent and unworthy language , not that he is .
We are fully in line with the European Parliament in saying that , without a systemic improvement of the human rights situation in Iran , our relations with Iran cannot develop properly .
Teheran &apos;s terrorist tentacles even reach as far as the south of its neighbour , Iraq .
The political and human rights issues are intertwined and again I welcome the assurances given this afternoon by the President @-@ in @-@ Office in this respect .
Secondly , I would like to express my appreciation for the extensive draft resolution , which bears witness to the great amount of work done by the political groups , and which , in fact , constitutes an expression of support for the balanced , considered and responsible strategy towards Iran that we are pursuing .
Mr President , after speaking I would like to hand over to you a two @-@ euro coin .
Some might consider this initiative to be a departure from the norm . In fact , it is only a matter of applying what we have all already decided on .
Thirdly , Africa must apply its own prescriptions , and by that I am referring , in particular , to the diagnosis provided by NEPAD .
Unfortunately , I found the Commissioner &apos;s statement rather unhelpful .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like first of all to acknowledge the political courage demonstrated by the Commission , in particular Commissioner Louis Michel , in presenting this strategic plan for Africa , which I hope will not be remembered as a catalogue of good intentions - with which the road to hell is paved - but as a Michel Plan , to some extent in the mould of the Marshall Plan .
I would remind you of the statement made by Mr Barroso at the G8 Summit : we donate EUR 1 billion per year .
So I would plead with all parties to persevere with the negotiation process .
Investment in education never goes to waste .

The debate will be opened at the UK informal Council on Sustainable Communities on 6 December in Bristol , where we will present our paper .
.
At the same time , however , it is in those very cities that increasing internal disparities have been noted , together with a worrying increase in social problems and even the social exclusion of certain groups .
This involved cities such as Milan , Dublin , Bristol and Nantes , and showed that it is the best possible cooperation between the region and the city that leads to the best results .
The most important of these definitions concerned the extension piece , which is mentioned frequently in the regulation .
Ladies and gentlemen , the House having voted on China today , I now have the great honour to welcome the members of the delegation of parliamentarians from the People &apos;s Republic of China who are visiting us on the occasion of the 22nd EP / China Inter @-@ Parliamentary Meeting .
We cannot , therefore , support the report .
We are therefore abstaining from voting on the resolutions on Iran and Ethiopia , even though we can in principle support quite a few of the demands made in them .
However , it is a source of deep concern that the report includes the presentation of animals as I strongly oppose the use of animals in the circus .
Mr President , I would like to bring to the attention of this House the findings of a visit I made to Romania to look in particular at the situation of babies and young adults with handicaps in institutional care .
The past and further extension of the EU makes this a particularly opportune time for the informal summit to also address the European social model .
The 1956 revolution was followed in Poland by the Solidarity movement and in 1968 by the Prague Spring .
Thanks to these programmes , a European space for training and education is gradually being created , and we have a great need of this space to support the labour market .
I must stress , however , that in my opinion it is essential for each Member State to draw up its own national lifelong learning strategy if the lifelong learning system is to function effectively .
What we also require of the Commission , though , is that this programme be made less bureaucratic .
They will create a virtual parliament where they can deal with human rights and minority issues .
Such cooperation will only be possible if we pursue cultural policy that is focused on providing a European added value and is equipped with the necessary resources for that to take place .
I would like to think that the men and women of the Committee on Culture and Education will be up to the task of assessing the final proposal from the perspective of that value . I hope , too , that the Council understands the message .
I want to assure you that adequate attention and financing will be provided to this end , despite or perhaps because of the shift to the citizenship programme , since this is more a matter of civic maturity than of culture alone .
However , the brief round @-@ up today of the new results of the MEDIA and ΜEDIA Plus programmes gives good cause to hope , Commissioner , that the MEDIA 2007 programme will help to further stabilise competition between European and foreign audiovisual producers and that it will result in the multiple application of each of the EUR 1.055 million in investments , education and development works .
So far the European Union has failed to make effective use of its own audiovisual market .
Amendment 35 might prevent possible problems on the internal market . It makes provision for maximum deadlines for formulating objections to shipments of waste for recovery on the basis of national standards .
As is required in the Council &apos;s Common Position , animal by @-@ products must generally be excluded for the sake of legal clarity .
All the precedent case @-@ law confirms that the Court will quash the reference to the subordinate legal base - Article 95 in this case - and interpret the whole regulation as founded on the main legal base - Article 175 .
As for Mr Schnellhardt &apos;s proposed exemption for small volumes , we regard that as unnecessary .
When it comes to air @-@ conditioning in cars , we are not convinced that there is at present good reason for requiring that the gas used should not be permitted to have a warming potential higher than 50 , partly because the climate benefits of such a reduction would be extremely small and , at the same time , very expensive but mainly because the technology involving carbon dioxide has not yet been tested sufficiently for us to commit ourselves irrevocably to it .
As I came here to speak tonight , the Committee on Legal Affairs was only beginning to consider - as is its duty - the proposed change in the legal base in the common position .
It is entirely a matter for each Member State to determine how labour relations are organised and whether or not its system includes collective bargaining .
Our response to that , Mr McCreevy , is that your interpretation of Article 49 will not prevail in Europe , at any rate not while the Social Democrats in this House have any say in the matter .
What is right for Sweden is not the choice of others .
He and his party had taken the lead in combating freedom of movement and had wanted to introduce transitional rules . They lost , however .
- determine the areas in which movements have to be restricted somewhat , because of course the virus travels with people ;
We must help the poorer countries do this .
In our amendments , we are also proposing that , as a priority , poultry farmers be offered common , seasonal influenza vaccination , in order to reduce the chances of recombination between human and avian influenza viruses at one of the most important potential interfaces , as Mr Trakatellis has said .
The influenza virus is an RNA virus containing eight genes .
Last year we established such a plan , which coordinates and links the national plans with the Community in order to achieve coordination .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by telling you how pleased I am to be able to speak here in our Chamber in front of the Romanian and Bulgarian observers . It is truly a first important stage towards Romania &apos;s and Bulgaria &apos;s accession to the EU .
Mr Masip Hidalgo , which point of order do you wish to raise now ?
This is incorrect in accordance with the Directive .
- Mr President , research into the use of stem cells to treat various diseases is currently in vogue .
This draft directive comes within the framework of strengthening European judicial cooperation .
That is an example that I believe could be exported to the other European Union Member States .
One example is the necessity of economic migrants having access , following their departure , to the money paid by them into European social security schemes .
Experience has taught us that immigrants from non @-@ Christian countries integrate poorly into Europe , despite the best efforts of the countries receiving them .
For me , therefore , the English text will be authentic and I also propose a split vote on the word &apos; binding . &quot;
I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I would like to say that this regulation is long awaited .
As soon as this evaluation is completed , EFSA will advise the Commission accordingly on the safety of the product .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , two questions have often sprung to my mind during this long process that has brought us to the vote at first reading .
Finally , I should like to return to the issue I emphasised at the beginning of my speech .
In particular , we are opposed to the cuts made to spending on the prevention of marine pollution .
We have been reluctant to go below the 20 % , but we support the compromise .
Realistically , however , there is no reason why , in the coming year , the administration should not achieve most of its stated targets .
This is a major step forward in finally putting an end to a hypocrisy within the European Union whereby , on the one hand , we have been funding health programmes warning of the ill effects of tobacco use and , on the other hand , subsidising tobacco production .
Mr President , first of all I , too , would like to congratulate Giovanni Pitella for his excellent work and wonderful report .
We cannot allow the equipment to be forced out of the European market .
Community support must be provided , as we have been advocating , in the event of an outbreak of the disease , given that this will cause poultry breeders to lose income as they restart their operations .
I hope the Commission will submit a consistent , pragmatic proposal containing precise , non @-@ arbitrary conditions .
Now here it is not appropriate for the European Union to be engaged in substantial bouts of extra regulation and so on , but here is where the open method of coordination could work properly , in things like work / life balance , childcare and provision for people to be able to raise their family and work at the same time , in how we get the best practice in pension and social security systems across Europe .
I believe we can do much more in that area , bringing together the fields of environment , agriculture , research and the funds we already have at our disposal .
It is time to realise that globalisation is not for tomorrow but today .
Mr President , as the first British Conservative to speak today , I should like to welcome the Prime Minister to Strasbourg .
They are not saying - which is why I disagree with Euro @-@ sceptics - &apos; we do not want Europe . &quot;
As EU President , Mr Blair can cut straight to the chase .
What is he actually going to do to stop the brain drain ?
I am pleased that , at tomorrow &apos;s informal meeting , the UK presidency will propose some strategic changes in this direction .
The issues that lead all 25 governments to conclude that a new , constitutional treaty is necessary remain on the table and will have to be addressed .
Does the new plan for 2007 @-@ 2013 include measures which target this group to promote their integration into their natural social environment and enable them to continue living there ?
. I sense that the honourable Member is inviting me to shed some light on the workings of the Council and , given the terms of the directive in question , I hesitate to do such a thing .
Last year assistance to the Palestinians from the European Community amounted to some EUR 250 million .
On the very serious question of the Kurdish community , I am in contact with the largest community centre of Kurds anywhere in the United Kingdom .
Given the difficulties of the June European Council , we did not immediately table proposals but rather sought to listen to the views that have been expressed in other Member States .
Some of them were elected in their own right , and some of them by virtue of the &apos; 25 % women &quot; rule .
She was brave enough to go there while the Taliban were in power .
They want to get off the streets where they are normally selling vegetables and other small things .
Even one hundred years ago , Azerbaijan was an incredibly rich country by reputation alone , although Baku was and continues to be one of the world &apos;s leading centres of oil production .
It will also enable us to make many of our offers conditional upon further democratic reforms and respect for the rule of law .
I would also like to see priority given to special support measures for women .
We have a common history and culture and also common problems and solutions to those problems .
Polish scientists are engaged in research in all the countries of the region , from Syria to Morocco .
The Moroccan Deputy Minister was here today and we will be working very closely with the Moroccans .
Commissioner , Mr Diamandouros , ladies and gentlemen , the Ombudsman is an independent institution and a mechanism for controlling the administration of the European Union .
. Mr President , I welcome Mr Mavrommatis &apos;s report and , indeed , I welcome the European Ombudsman here today to the European Parliament .
That goes to show that the Lord works in mysterious ways .
The Ombudsman should be a guardian of good administration within the European institutions , and he should cooperate even more closely with his counterparts at local and regional level .
Mr President , we are returning to the same thing ; we prefer the voting order established in the procedure .
The fight by the workers &apos; movement against the draft budget needs to include the entire anti @-@ grass roots policy of the EU .
In some cases this protection is effective , and in many cases it is lifesaving .
Last Saturday , 22 October 2005 , an opposition leader , the businessman Sanjar Umarov , was taken into custody .
On 13 May , a demonstration in Andijan was violently suppressed , and it is thought that several hundred civilians may have died .
It is about nothing less than the destruction of Tibet and the Tibetan culture and nation , for no other reason than that this peaceful nation exists .
A few days ago , twenty people were arrested for trading in hard core paedophilic material - children of two , four , five and six years old , bestiality and such abject things - and not one of them was named .
When he lost his rights of domicile in Slovenia , he settled in Germany , where he lived and worked for 12 years .
As well as laying down principles , the declaration also stresses that the promotion of decent work and fair globalisation should be incorporated into development strategies at global and national levels .
I should like to ask anyone in Europe - the tradesman in Cologne , the artisan in Marseille , the farmer in Greece : are they happy with the results of globalisation ?
Some of the amendments are far @-@ removed from reality and would be better placed in the dustbin of the history of socialism than in the context of the modern welfare state and I cannot , therefore , lend them my support .
We have to take note of the fact that this process of liberal , non @-@ transparent and unfettered globalisation is of concern to our fellow citizens .
People say that the world is getting smaller , and that it will soon become one village , although others believe it would be truer to say that a very narrow section of the social elite of the world are growing closer to each other , while the majority are increasingly excluded from opportunities .
Nonetheless , I see the following dimensions or problems :
The Commission will continue to monitor these allegations closely .
We cannot use kid gloves to fight terrorism , but nor can we throw accusations at democratic countries solely on the basis of conjecture .
I call on you to wake up , perform the duties of your office and take responsibility .
The aim has always been to ensure a neutral modification of the import regime with a most @-@ favoured @-@ nation tariff that provides equivalent market access conditions to let in American suppliers - as the current quota regime does - and keeps an equivalent level of ACP preference .
It would be extremely serious if that were to be jeopardised .
Irrespective of the remedies applied , all stakeholders again realised that a pension fund involves a long @-@ term commitment to employees and pensioners .
The Court is able to report , and for the first time , that the efforts by the Commission and the Member States in connection with the introduction of the Integrated Administration and Control System- abbreviated to &apos; IACS &quot; - which covers 59 % of agricultural expenditure , have had a positive effect .
Even when there is a change of Parliament , a change of Commission , a change of make @-@ up of the Council , things carry on in the same way .
Enough said .
International comparisons show us in a very good light .
We saw , at the informal summit , a confirmation of the Commission &apos;s analysis on how to safeguard our values in a globalised world .
Although I have a high regard for the Energy Commissioner and work well with him , I have to say that we have often pointed out how important it is , in view of current developments , that the Commission as a whole should give a clear commitment to a policy on alternative energy .
We must choose peace , not war .
In the way it disseminates information , the Commission represents dictatorship by the majority , or democracy is measured by the attitude the majority adopt when lending an ear to the minorities .
In the little time available to me , I should like to outline the problem in a number of major points .
At the same time , however , we must see that citizens , the players in economic life , object to the excessively bureaucratic procedures .
There are pictures there that dishonour all women , and I ask that they be removed right now .
With regard to the national plans in individual Member States , however , we should like to emphasise three aspects :
Such a thing should not be tolerated or permitted in this House .
This legislation offers a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ lifetime opportunity to achieve proper protection for humans and the environment while at the same time being workable and maintaining the competitiveness of European industry .
The order of the debate will not be altered as a result of your comment .
Chemicals build up in the body and can cause cancer .
The decision I hope we shall vote through on Thursday here in the Chamber greatly resembles the proposal put forward by the Presidency .
I hope that people will be directly informed , on the basis of tests , of the dangers they pose .
A nightmare !
Hence we want to make it simpler : we want a single regulation , more understandable ways of establishing which substances are among the estimated 20 % that will need proper assessment and authorisation .
Myself , I call that a defeat .
Mr President , the EU &apos;s Chemicals Regulation ( REACH ) will ensure above everything else the protection of people &apos;s health and standards of environmental protection that are as excellent as possible .
.
However , when a matter is delegated to an agency with its own structure - usually intergovernmental - and its own board , which is accountable in a totally different way , then the accountability is inevitably lessened .
It should be pointed out that although a fuel tax would have an impact on prices , it may in fact contribute to putting air travel on an equal footing with alternative means of transportation , such as road travel , for which taxes are currently paid on fuel , and which are often the only option for the less well @-@ off traveller .
I would also like to point out that we are talking about an evaluation exercise and that we have no intention of putting forward new legislative proposals at this point .
You can perhaps imagine , therefore , what a huge job it is .
As the honourable Member knows , this is something of great interest to me .
The fund will promote investment in human capital and in life @-@ long learning , as well as the conclusion of agreements on employment and partnerships for innovation at national , regional and local level .
Mrs Gomes and myself were not only jostled , not only almost hit , but also called &apos; fascists &quot; and &apos; Nazis &quot; by this group .
In addition , we , together with the United States , have co @-@ hosted a very important conference - the Iraq International Conference - in Brussels on 22 June .
To be sure , Mesopotamia &apos;s reconstruction continues to be threatened from within and without , as it was before .
Instead of having a democratic , stable Iraq , we will have a civil war in Iraq , we will have troubles in Iraq and they will affect all the Middle East . &quot; That seems to me an important statement by the President of Iraq at the present time .
Today &apos;s debate here in Strasbourg will allow us to take stock of the current situation and offer us a further opportunity to demonstrate to the rest of the world that the EU takes this problem very seriously and is committed to delivering results .
The majority of the measures proposed in the report are aimed at companies and manufacturers .
Climate change needs to be dealt with as a global problem .
It is essential that we broaden its scope and set horizontal sectoral targets .
We need to devote further energy to the development of a tax , sanctioning and promotion system that would encourage companies to operate in an efficient and environmentally friendly way .
We have engaged in policy dialogue with the United States administration within the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change and within other fora and meetings , such as the Joint Climate Change Science and Technology Workshop .
Air travellers should be well informed prior to travel about their prospective flight , particularly if the actual carrier is not the one originally indicated at the time of reservation .
It goes without saying that nuclear power plants need to be shut down safely to protect people and the environment .
In all parliaments sometimes you speak to a very large number and sometimes you do not .
Therefore , if people have two contracts - two jobs , one person - then they can evade the limit , entirely unregulated and unprotected .
Hampton Court was indeed a success .
I should also like to put a clear question to you , Mr Straw .
I welcome the papers that were presented at Hampton Court , because they deal with how the European Union can bring added value to our citizens , particularly in the area of the energy markets where we have a crisis waiting to happen .
My problem with what a number of colleagues have said is that people refer to the need for change and then say that the future for the European Union nevertheless lies in the past .
Mr President , I would like to raise a point of order , in accordance with Rule 65 ( c ) , if I remember correctly .
Instead of creating and sustaining world class centres of academic excellence , we are destroying them through lack of funding and misconceived class @-@ driven doctrines .
I would also like to thank the Presidency for having associated our heads of delegations in statements made by the Presidency , together with the Commission , especially in the Arab countries .
His doing so is , of course , completely unacceptable and must be condemned by everyone .
That would have been inconceivable only a matter of years ago , and the European Union deserves credit in recognising the extent to which it has contributed towards the new opportunities that are afforded to many citizens to travel , which have now been enjoyed by many citizens in recent months and years .
The European Union has most recently expressed these concerns in the context of the EU @-@ China human rights dialogue , which took place on 24 and 25 October 2005 in Beijing .
The terrorists who reject that commitment and seek to use violence to impose their ideas will be defeated . &quot; They added thereafter that the European Union was strengthening , and again I quote directly : &apos; its commitment to combating terrorism and upholding the fundamental principles of freedom , security and justice . &quot;
I cannot claim to have spoken to Hilary Benn in quite as recent days as he has , but I can assure you that , when I meet him at Cabinet tomorrow morning , I will search out what he told you at the Remembrance Service in Leeds on Sunday .
I proposed that these Commission proposals should find their way into a regulation calling on the Member States to transpose the agreement , and consequently committing them to all that it would entail - reporting and so on - as well . I regard this as the right approach .
In this very place , before the Irish Commissioner Mr Mac Sharry , I described an animal from the far North , the bones in its foot shattered , its tendons crushed and its arteries severed , which tears off its own foot and drags itself over the red @-@ stained snow to die 20 metres away under the fir trees , all for the profit of a luxury industry run by people who are about as Indian as I , with the name Martinez , am genetically Swedish .
Secondly , the Commission has failed to provide an impact assessment of the proposed directive .
The topic is a decidedly delicate one , as the procurement of military equipment can be said to touch upon the very heart of national sovereignty .
.
The European Parliament cannot work wonders , but it may well be in a position today to give peace a somewhat better chance .
Nonetheless , although it is a fact that the European Union Member States are signatories to the multilateral non @-@ proliferation agreements , it is also a fact that two Member States are nuclear states , that Turkey , a candidate country for accession , is a nuclear state and that , even more seriously , US tactical weapons are deployed on the soil of many Member States , including Germany , Italy , Greece and the Netherlands .
I am deeply dismayed that the Council has failed to be present today .
As a result , I , for one , have suffered a bad fall and have sustained a fracture .
Actually , these provisions replace some obsolete texts that were unsuitable for the encouragement of innovation and for adequate protection of people in an increasingly complex , dangerous and changing environment .
.
Subsequently , an agreement was signed with the USA , Canada and Russia , which was mainly intended to avoid trade conflicts rather than to improve animal welfare .
Let us reestablish Community preference and quickly .
Moreover , I do not think that the final vote will be affected since the nominal lists have already been drawn up , so why do we not just go ahead and have the debate and the vote today ?
. - Mr President , by way of introduction I should like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Martens .
Its analysis not only highlights the continent &apos;s potential , but also sets out the way things actually are .
Unless Parliament asks for the vote to be postponed , it will take place following this afternoon &apos;s debates .
In this way , we can help to improve the management of public finance and support institutions , including national parliaments .
I can see many other aspects to reproductive health ; I can see above all the health and the rights of women and children .
More importantly , and most urgently , I should like to ask the Commission about recent UN figures that indicate that so far very little of the aid that has been promised has been received .
Mr President , the Commission has made a rapid and generous response to help the victims of this terrible disaster .
On 5 July 2004 , the EU Troika - consisting of the Netherlands , the UK and the Commission - handed an amicus curiae brief to the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs in support of the motion for the reconsideration of the case .
While some political prisoners have been released , 1.000 remain in custody and political leaders continue to be sentenced to brutal prison sentences , some of up to 106 years .
I say this out of respect for Mrs Martens as rapporteur and , of course , out of respect for the importance of the issue .
However , Vice @-@ President Frattini will be unable to take this item tomorrow as he must attend a meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council .
Much rides on the Doha Round : for us in Europe , for developing countries and indeed for the whole of the global economy .
We expect our partners to make similar concessions and to pursue the necessary flexibility which will allow the balanced progress needed to be made in the individual sectors of the Doha agenda .
But then that is not an immediate priority under the plan .
If , though , you peek behind the facade of fine words , the current WTO round of negotiations turns out - yet again , alas - to be all about access to markets .
This is the kind of blackmail that could cause the whole Hong Kong Round to collapse .
We have achieved a far @-@ reaching reform programme for European agriculture in 2003 .
I know from my own position as a UK Minister that there is a great deal of Parliamentary and public concern about human rights in Cambodia , Laos and Vietnam .
Police and the military have destroyed ten houses of Catholics in Quang Ngai Province .
That stipulation continues to be breached on a daily basis , but we still pump in aid as if all was well .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
The joint parade of the North and South Korean delegations under the flag of the Korean peninsula during the opening ceremony of the games in Sydney was an outstanding and very strong example .
The Olympics and other global sporting events should be a time when all enmities are put aside between sportsmen and women .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
Since 2003 , the Austrian section of the river has been polluted by three leather factories using naphthalene sulfonate for tanning , and discharging it into the Rába at the end of the tanning process .
That concludes the item .
.
This is why I agree with both the Commissioner and the rapporteur that a balanced approach is the most rational to take .
With this in mind , I hope that the report by Mr Parish , who has done a good job , will be adopted tomorrow , and would like once again to congratulate the Commission on its level @-@ headed attitude .
This decision represents a waiver from the normal rules of patent law , particularly those set out in the WTO TRIPs Agreement .
.
The democratic accountability of the Union is hereby strengthened .
This opens up a very broad and significant area , both for the full involvement of Parliament , and as a way of moving beyond the intergovernmental approach , which up to now has prevailed .
As is obvious , criminal law is intended to punish the unlawful conduct of individuals and , if the matter falls under Community competence , it seems frankly unlikely that Parliament - the institution representing democracy - should not participate in the creation of criminal law .
We can only hope that the echoes of our debates will reach the Commission nevertheless .
The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Toia , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on European Electronic Communications Regulation and Markets 2004 ( 2005 / 2052 ( INI ) ) ( A6 @-@ 0305 / 2005 ) .
That must be a priority of the action plan , the importance and significance of which I have just pointed out , strengthening a telecommunications area appropriate to the free movement of persons and of personal communications .
We are today on the eve of an ECOFIN Council at which , I hope , the Ministers for Economic Affairs and Finance will hear the very loud signal this Assembly wants to send out to them through this oral question , as well as through several written statements , which have been submitted at our Parliament &apos;s Registry and signed by a large number of Members .
The Council is not saying &apos; yes &quot; and it is not saying &apos; no &quot; ; the Council is taking no decisions and is absent from this Chamber .
At the same time , however , many doubts have been raised over whether VAT rates need to be harmonised , and indeed we have heard such sentiments voiced today in this Chamber .
My own country never applied for reduced rates .
Any claims that the police service is being remilitarised should be dismissed - if you excuse the use of such terms - as nonsense and demagoguery .
I hope that the male Members in the Chamber today , as well as the female Members , will vote in favour of my amendment .
Broadly speaking , I warmly welcome cooperation on various levels between the administrations of different Member States , especially when this is the result of a voluntary initiative undertaken by these administrations ( although this can be encouraged ) and when it does not lead to a new administrative and bureaucratic entity .
Independence for the Suze Valley , free Piedmont !
With this in mind , we endorse this request .
Far from congratulating Austria on doing something positive and taking the lead in this area , the Commission &apos;s response was to send the Austrian Government an admonitory letter , in which it threatened to overturn the ban on circuses keeping wild animals - imposed not only by Austria but also applying to some degree in other EU Member States - on the grounds that the ban on performances by wild animals went against the free movement of services .
The committee considered this matter over several meetings and finally came to the decision , by a large and persuasive majority , that it would not be appropriate in this case to give him the benefit of this House &apos;s immunity .
Moreover , Amendment 12 makes the link with consumer applications as defined in the directive on electronic waste .
What , then , we are concerned with here are lifespan and economy , its being apparent that these batteries last on average more than twice as long after 500 chargings .
Someone pointed out that , after 9 years , Belgium has reached a level of 56 % and Austria , after 14 years , still lies somewhere at around 40 % .
There will be a lot of uncertainty because of the legal void that will be created , since the old ISD regime will be abrogated and the new regime will enter into force without the new MiFID having been transposed .
They are our main allies in the service of the public interest and in preventing us from being guided by a handful of large market operators or national markets that serve their own interests , which , sadly , was what did sometimes happen at the time when the groundwork for this dossier was being done .
The value of their property is being wiped out by a development control law that does not seem to be working .
Not putting an end to this will mean that certain business groups will become richer , bringing about massive social , environmental and economic troubles in the near future .
We must therefore take pleasure from the fact that we have been able to reach an agreement amongst the institutions which has the majority support of this House .
Yet it is only this kind of approach that is responsible , serious and able to produce appropriate results .
If , Commissioner , we are to make tax policy at the European level , we have to be aware of the fact that that is not far removed from competence in tax policy as described in the European Communities Treaty .
My second comment would be that taxation can influence the internal market , and all those here who spend their whole time telling us to make the internal market work better should concern themselves with the fact that excessive tax competition can have a fundamental impact , particularly in terms of cross @-@ border effects , on the operation of the internal market .
Mr President , the European Union can be proud of its achievements in the field of non @-@ discrimination , which place it amongst the most advanced regions in the world in this respect .
I would like to ask the Commissioner to commit the Commission here and now , publicly and on the record , to ensuring that Member States will use the funds available for this Year to target all forms of discrimination equally .
Let me be quite clear : having an extra EUR 275 million available for external actions and a protocol that better acknowledges Parliament &apos;s competence in foreign and security policy is not a trophy for us to show off but a necessary response , a decision warranted by everything that we , together , are expected to do in the world .
In heading 4 : External Actions , the Council reinstated its first reading and also accepted the Commission &apos;s Amending Letter 1 concerning traditional assistance for sugar protocol countries , allocating resources from its first reading margin .
There are probably not many Members in this Chamber , apart from those representing the United Kingdom , who , within the context of those talks , would like to see Great Britain &apos;s special rebate continue in the years to come .
I agree with the many who say that Parliament &apos;s most important achievement has been the broader scope of the programmes relating to young people .
You have big problems and many of them are of your own design .
However - and this is an important &apos; however &quot; - research and development are also a fundamental pillar in terms of the competitiveness of our companies , of the competitiveness of our economies .
In exactly the same way , we demand of you that , for every initiative that you take , you also specify the legal basis for it , making it possible to trace precisely whence Europe derives the competence to do something in this particular area .
However , we will keep a close eye on the Commission and the execution of this programme .
In any event , it should not be the fishermen who foot the bill for the lengthy negotiations and renewal of agreements .
Indeed , we are nearing the end of the current financial framework and the so @-@ called N + 2 rule will apply , whereby authorisation expenses are automatically cancelled when they are not implemented within two years .
Land development issues in the autonomous region of Valencia are not a matter for the European Parliament or the European Union at all .
This was a call that came specifically from the European Parliament .
Mr President , democracy and freedom are not defended through restrictions on human rights .
Shall we do so ?
We all know that citizens prefer to deal with their own government , rather than the European government , to protect their rights and guarantees , so it must be a balance between the two .
Madam President , this is a very difficult debate because , interestingly , groups that are normally homogeneous are split ; political allies who normally work with one another are split .
Are infringements of intellectual property rights in peer @-@ to @-@ peer networks serious enough crimes for the data retained to be accessed ?
Our Presidency has sought to use the six months since June to build on the broad range of existing EU commitments .
There is a lot more to do when it comes to Zimbabwe , Belarus , Burma , Saudi Arabia etc .
The Troika often works to promote human rights in an intergovernmental framework .
The Public Prosecutor closed the Tunisian Magistrates &quot; Association &apos;s office in August .
Secondly , Tunisia is a model of Mediterranean cooperation .
It is unacceptable to provide some with legal protection and deny it to others .
As a former journalist - since you mention it - I have discussed the influence of product placement on information and on information @-@ type programmes at length with my journalist colleagues and have come to the conclusion that a full ban on product placement for information and in information @-@ type programmes is desirable .
The following questions are addressed to the Commission :
Community assistance under the Ignalina programme is delivered in two ways . The first is directly to the beneficiary country using a mechanism based on one of the European Community &apos;s pre @-@ accession financial instruments , PHARE .
I would also like to point out that the EU Presidency has just made a demarche to Turkey concerning the Cyprus application for membership in the Wassenaar agreement .
I should like to ask Commissioner Barrot to confirm here in this House that the Commission will be presenting a model and an impact assessment in two years &quot; time .
Paradoxically , however , this directive addresses environmental problems , congestion and safety most effectively through a surrender of competence : it has been decided not to treat urban areas in the same way as sensitive mountain regions , yet on the other hand the full compatibility of the Eurovignette has been recognised , with urban tolls Ken Livingstone being used directly to regulate congestion and combat pollution .
Needless to say , this goal is to improve transport infrastructure , and by this I mean not only improvements to road infrastructure . Related goals include cutting traffic jams , reducing the number of accidents and limiting emissions of harmful substances .
I would like to thank the European Parliament , particularly your rapporteur , Mr Evans , who cooperated with the Council and the Commission to facilitate the speedy adoption of this proposal .
We must therefore congratulate the rapporteur on his ability to broker compromises in adopting amendments , for example those relating to the distribution of responsibilities between airports and airlines .
However , I can tell you that we have already achieved a lot : we offer training courses especially for consumer organisation staff in new Member States .
That applies to financing too .
I realise this is not your dossier , Commissioner , but I believe you said that there will be substantially more support in the future .
We are critical of the EU &apos;s export subsidies to domestic sugar producers and take a positive view of the fact that it will be possible for the sugar trade to take place under fairer conditions in the future .
Money should be returned in the event of non @-@ compliance .
While the free functioning of the market brings benefits in terms of economic development , it alone cannot ensure development .
I shall now turn to the issue of growth and employment in the context of the new Lisbon Strategy .
But Europe has responded .
That is not in your interests ; it is not in our interests , and we will not agree to it .
My group hopes that you will review the so @-@ called war on terror .
That is why we might have hoped for a calmer and more thorough debate in the Council and in all the European institutions over the past few months .
Internal security was meant to be one of your Presidency &apos;s priorities ; instead , it has become a fiasco .
Relations between the Commission and the Council , and also between the individual Member States , are positively icy .
Best wishes and Merry Christmas to the outgoing British Presidency .
Mr Farage began his speech by accusing my Foreign Office officials behind me as being both able and &apos; treacherous . &quot;
Why ?
The fight against inhuman laws .
The press asked us questions such as , &apos; Is it Islam versus the West , or perhaps a clash of civilisations ? . &quot;
I will return to Nigeria with a deep sense of mission and will help redefine the future of the vulnerable and powerless .
When they are , however , being talked about , it is a question of abiding by one &apos;s word and one &apos;s commitments .
This Directive no longer has crime prevention as a goal .
Moreover , telecommunications operators will in all likelihood have to be compensated for their additional costs .
Human dignity and human rights are worth more to us than anything else ; we must speak out wherever they are violated , and where it is unclear whether they have been , we must set investigations in motion .
They cannot be our friends when it suits us and not our friends when it does not suit us .
That is the reality of the situation and it is an issue which , rightly , will not go away .
The European Union &apos;s institutions must investigate this matter thoroughly , and ensure that the governments of the Member States abide by the Treaty on European Union within the territory of the EU .
I also met the chairmen of key committees of the parliament and representatives of all political parties .
I trust that together we will complete the fifth enlargement round and make a success of it .
The Liberal Group would like to see Romania and Bulgaria become Member States of the EU in 2007 .
According to one person in the know , it would certainly help if the Bulgarian media were to film the corrupt practices that go on at the border .
Obviously , we are sending extremely clear signals about the negative things - problems , difficulties and requirements - but less clear signals of encouragement and appreciation and , above all , of the sincerity with which we shall welcome them .
In Romania examples of progress include : a new head of the anti @-@ corruption department in the General Prosecutor &apos;s office ; 11 new senior prosecutors removed for ineffectiveness ; and 22 cases of corruption by former and current senators and deputies now under way .
. I hope I do not disappoint the honourable Member , who has now joined us in the Chamber , with the answer that I can offer , but the Council has received no proposals from the Commission on this subject and it therefore has not addressed the issue .
. I hope that we are able to secure that budget framework .
I referred the honourable Member to the relevant details that have been set out in the Commission &apos;s proposals and , for his assistance , I would recommend document COM ( 2005 ) 0598 , which sets out the relevant details for the Commission &apos;s proposals to put such quotas into Community law .
An example of one such issue is the granting of exemptions for harmless types of machinery such as wristwatches .
That is why all Member States must get down to effective market control , for without this market control , this directive remains a paper tiger , as was already the case with the previous directive .
What is apparent to me from the shrimp crisis in my own region , and the role that VinVis has played in this , is that the women &apos;s network has contributed towards a solution , and I have to conclude quite simply that it is very much to be welcomed that the fisheries sector is being broadened socially speaking .
On the basis of indicators and benchmarks , both parties will jointly evaluate the results of this policy and , where appropriate , will make the necessary adjustments .
Just so .
. Mr President , the issue of sanctions is of some urgency .
Let me make it clear : I see merit in equitable and proportionate penalties across the EU , but I am less than impressed by the fact that , so long as the fishermen of the United Kingdom were bearing the brunt of punitive action , nobody cared .
It is also the cornerstone of the network of our tuna agreements in the Indian Ocean .
The Commission already complies with the transmission of such information in line with the current interinstitutional arrangements .
However , in order to send a message to the ACP countries that some of us here have not forgotten them , I request that my name be deleted from the text , and I have a proposal for my fellow members of the Committee on Development , and for them alone : make a final , symbolic gesture by voting &apos; no . &quot;
2 . It does not matter how much Parliament glosses over its complicity in the systematic reduction in the Community budget in recent years - surely this reflects the commitments made by the right @-@ wing and social @-@ democrat forces in the Commission , the Council and in every EU Member State - but the ( cold ) figures are there for all to see .
. As we have previously stated , we object to the premises on which the reform of the Common Market Organisation for Sugar is predicated .
Let us , for once , address the people of Tunisia directly to tell them that the European Parliament will not fall into the trap set for it by Mr Ben Ali by continuing to accommodate a dictatorship that is no longer even attempting to disguise itself .
Although it likes to play with words , the US administration has never denied the existence of the flights , the kidnappings or the illegal prisons .
The effect of the Chinese system of re @-@ education through work is that people can be sent , without a court having passed sentence upon them , to a camp for up to three years .
The freedom of NGOs to operate is an essential part of democracy and stable civil society , which the Russian leadership had said it supports .
Here is a concrete example : the widely known and regular violation of human rights in Belarus and Russia .
We do not make similar calls in the case of Ethiopia , since it would be all too obvious that they are pointless .
I ask all of you here today to share a minute &apos;s silence in his memory .
I refer specifically to five Bosnian citizens and one legal resident who were abducted by United States agents in January 2002 , in defiance of Bosnian court orders , and held incommunicado for two years .
.
We have seen one example of it today , and we saw further examples a few months ago in France .
Combating homophobia is an educational task , and it is intended that 2007 should be the Year against Discrimination .
This report , for which I am the rapporteur , does not call the Member States &quot; prerogative into question : the right to citizenship and the granting of citizenship are their prerogatives , as expressly laid down in the Treaties .
If we ignore this fact , we will merely be creating utopias .
- The debate is closed .
They underline our Parliament &apos;s awareness of the problem and its desire to resolve every aspect of it , that is to say to banish sexual slavery from our society .
It is therefore ridiculous to differentiate laws about trafficking in human beings from those pertaining to prostitution .
Money must be made , and that is why clients are needed , so we must start close at home in order to raise awareness and public sensitivity , as well as the visibility of this distressing problem , and to discourage the exploitation of these women and children in our Member States .
It must be said - and I wish to place on record my gratitude for it - that the support for , and the high level of trust and confidence that was placed in , Europe &apos;s negotiators was of immense importance , value and encouragement to us .
This will be achieved by counterbalancing free trade with social development objectives , which amounts to guaranteeing that trade rules take account of non @-@ commercial aspects , the environment , public health and social rights .
It is very important to Europe and many other countries .
On the credit side , I would like to point out that your negotiating style and the way in which you communicated information to this House helped reinforce our determination , and for that you have our warm thanks .
In this regard , we could usefully draw on the work done by the European Economic and Social Committee within the Single Market Observatory .
It is a necessary protection that each WTO member has to ensure that their vital interests are not shunned or overlooked .
A conflict such as this very aptly illustrates the desperation and dependence in which the EU does not want to find itself , and proves once more that the European Union must build in a guarantee of secure energy supply .
Of course , the phenomenon we are seeing today , the melting of the glaciers , both in the Alps and the Arctic Circle , the possible change in direction of the Gulf Stream , the rise in sea levels and a series of other phenomena will have serious repercussions on life , health , the environment and the ecosystems of the whole of mankind , which will be all the greater in the very poor countries , which do not have the means to deal with these consequences .
It is only natural that there is limited space in most ports for those who want to provide port services , and by no means will every one of them get their chance at once , but that is far from saying that any one of them is discriminated against .
As a global trading nation , the United Kingdom handles more international freight than any other EU country and port management there is driven by free enterprise and market forces .
We cannot encourage the Commission to reproduce the same texts every time Parliament has voted against them , nor can we encourage it not to listen or to hear anything and to proceed on the basis of a mystical form of ultraliberalism that flouts everyone &apos;s opinions , including those of the professionals .
Its main advocate is the Commission , which wants to drive through this legislation at any price .
Mr President , when the European Parliament threw out the proposed port services directive two years ago no one believed that the Commission would try to bring it back .
The port services market was liberalised soon after Estonia gained its freedom from the Soviet command economy .
I think that we all had a common goal to give those from the European Commission that are conducting talks both with Russia and with China something to work with and , of course , also to send a political signal to the Council for the giving of a mandate .
Amongst other things , this ensures that air travel is in fact the safest form of transportation .
There is a great deal of scope for developing the aviation sector , and this is an integral part of our transport policy .
We voted against these elements of the text , but finally voted for the report in pursuing the better course of the migrant people in Europe .
. Nobody can deny that organised trafficking of women and children is a pressing issue facing the countries of the EU , and coordinated action across the EU is necessary to fight it .
While it is evident that the EU could not and should not take sides , we made it clear to both sides that it was in their strong interest to come to an agreement rapidly .
We have to pursue natural resource productivity and energy efficiency if we are to be less dependent on others ; I would be dead against striving for a fully self @-@ sufficient Europe , which would be a naive approach in terms of the overall debate , but we do have to work towards a Europe that makes adequate use of raw materials .
It is a mistake for individual Member States to attempt to reach an agreement with Russia , as Germany has done , sacrificing the interests of the Baltic States , Poland , Austria and other Member States in the process .
However , in some countries economic measures were taken in respect of the supply of gas .
Nevertheless , the hoped @-@ for financial incentives for the development of energy crops have not materialised .
The review of the sugar industry is a premeditated crime for rural areas and for the European industry and of dubious results for developing countries , especially the less developed countries .
This is highly regrettable , because the assumption of a leading role in this issue would enable us to achieve our objectives in negotiations on the liberalisation of trade in non @-@ agricultural commodities .
We must deliver on our promises and open up our market in 2009 ; we have procrastinated long enough .
One of the basic principles of the European Union &apos;s policy in the water sector is cooperation between the regions in various Member States which share common water resources .
The preparatory work by the Commission has not yet reached the stage of examining the impact of a common consolidated tax base on different regions within Member States .
. As usual , Mrs Cederschiöld makes a very compelling argument for her case .
The Commission has also been instrumental in raising the profile of the co @-@ chairs .
If we are going to shut down sugar production in Ireland and in the EU , we can and must properly compensate the farmers and producers , even if just to salve our own conscience .
Nevertheless , by safeguarding the possibility of the restructuring fund supporting those giving up on part of the quota , we will be helping the sugar industry in some countries , such as Portugal , and shifting it away from the agricultural sector towards sustaining the processing side of the industry .
They want alternative employment when their factories close down .
Mrs McGuinness , this is addressed specifically to you : I would never dare interfere in the decisions taken by the Member States to decide at what level they would agree on this compensation percentage .
It is worth noting that the organisations in question no longer need to act at Community level in order to exercise this right .
We are talking about the implemented regulations of an environmentally @-@ protective participatory democracy .
Firstly , rules on embankment safety have been devised to prevent this type of disaster from occurring in the future .
Arrangements such as these have to be made in advance , of course , as accidents very often result in mine operators declaring bankruptcy .
Third , after a strong fight for higher standards , Parliament &apos;s delegation suddenly dropped all of its demands after the Council offered a minimal increase of one of the two standards of the sufficient category .
The exceptional Ferreira report contains many valuable proposals for the review , putting particular emphasis on the environmental aspects of sustainable development .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I extend my very warm greetings to all of you here this morning .
It is up to the Commission to put all these considerations on the table in the review of 2008 / 09 .
We therefore welcome the Austrian Presidency &apos;s willingness to inject new dynamism into the discussion of some pending proposals that are key to the success of the Lisbon Strategy , including the Services Directive .
This is why we say that small and medium @-@ sized businesses should be at the heart of our thinking on economic policy .
On the subject of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , I agree with you , but at some stage a decision will have to be taken here too .
Say who gets what , who pays for what , from the European pots of money .
Let us uphold people &apos;s rights and not allow Europe to be a Europe of Brussels technocrats .
No to the strong euro which prevents industrial growth and no , of course , to the high interest rates which are ruining households .
I have heard that Europol is to be reinforced .
Regulation or a framework programme for competitiveness must be on the agenda .
Now , certain Member States , including Austria , regardless of the positive examples of Great Britain , Ireland and Sweden , want to forgo those crucial benefits , introducing transition periods immediately after enlargement .
In real terms , resources are being cut by 4 % , and EUR 8 billion are additionally being set aside for Romania and Bulgaria .
Your rapporteur &apos;s amendments were such as to allay certain fears on the part of the various actors in our ports , fears that were felt as much by businesses as by workers .
Parliament wishes to allocate more money to important areas , but advocates an unduly high total level of expenditure and , like the Council , wishes to allocate too much money to agricultural expenditure and regional aid .
My having , in spite of everything , voted in favour of this draft has to do with the fact that it is in many ways an improvement on the 1976 bathing water quality directive that applies today .
.With our European ports featuring among the most modern and most competitive in the world , I fail to understand the need for a directive aimed at liberalising port services in Europe .
Employees and trade unions did not want it .
I am worried that if we start putting people on trial here for their feelings or phobias , it will only result in one new form of discrimination and manipulation .
Paragraph 45 :
I hope that one consequence of our joint effort over the coming months will be an increase in positive thinking in Europe , and I agree with Mr Voggenhuber that we must discuss Europe as a , as something that really is to the benefit of all its citizens .
This is tantamount to trampling over the democratic will of the people of at least two EU Member States .
That time will come after the period of reflection , after the European debate and after having changed the context .
Fourthly , to be consistent with how we acted in January 2005 , a positive result from this period of reflection would be to maintain the current text , which would only be possible with the appropriate measures .
Mr President , Europe arose in the Middle Ages with Christianity as its foundation .

At the EU @-@ Russia Summit in November 2004 , Russia agreed to the European Commission &apos;s EUR 20 million aid programme to support socio @-@ economic recovery in the northern Caucasus , in addition to continuing humanitarian aid .
In conclusion , I would like to make an appeal for help for Russia at this point to ...
We know that the main reason for many people breaking out is because they do not have jobs .
Any doubts as to the commitment of all Council of Europe Member States to the rule of law and human rights as defined in the European Convention on Human Rights must be dispelled .
At the same time , in connection with the restructuring of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission In Kosovo ( UNMIK ) , the EU has held informal consultations with the UNMIK together with other international organisations and partners .
There is a rising tide of opinion against the expansion of large @-@ scale oil plantations .
We are convinced that the ENPI will give us a better , more flexible and more focused instrument with which we can support reforms and cross @-@ border cooperation .
I would ask the Commissioner if this attitude from Minsk might hinder the European delegation being posted to the Belarusian capital .
The report has been produced on the committee &apos;s own initiative in an area in which the European Parliament has no competence .
This boycott was in part a demonstration of the disapproval of the partner countries of , firstly , the considerable pressure placed on them by the Commission and the Member States to conclude cooperation agreements on migration policies and on the fight against terrorism and , secondly , the lack of budgetary prospects for the implementation of a true cooperation and development policy .
I hope that Russia will very soon find itself in a position to be able to ratify the border agreements with Estonia and Latvia .
I appreciate therefore that his job has not been easy .
We are duty bound to do this , and , in light of its people &apos;s exemplary record on democracy , good governance and respect for human rights , not to mention their profound historical , social , political , cultural and geographical ties with the EU , Cape Verde deserves this .
A concrete proposal has been promised .
More effective use of the internet and business are areas which offer enormous opportunities .
If our appeals body acts too slowly , the penalty will be deemed null and void .
Naturally , Members &quot; rights are not restricted to merely the right to vote : we are a parliament and not a &apos; votament . &quot;
We are faced with a dynamic situation , but one that is vulnerable to further setbacks .
Contrary to the impression given by the media , great men do not make history on their own : institutions and situations have their part to play .
I think our Neighbourhood Policy and the action plan would be the best basis for such further democratisation , for the rule of law , which is one of the major issues and one on which we insist very strongly .
.
Our committee will be your ally in this endeavour .
In our opinion , it is very , very dangerous .
To do so is essential if the Lisbon Strategy is to bring the success that all women and men want to see .
That point is concerned with preventing social exclusion and combatting all forms of discrimination , including that based on the condition of disabled persons .
It was not possible to table a motion for a roll call vote earlier on , as we did not know whether we would be voting .
The Member States must do more to make things simpler for small enterprises , and concerns are expressed about there being big differences in respect of education in entrepreneurship and the cultivation of the spirit of enterprise in schools .
I will not vote for structural or social cohesion policy instruments to be used to cushion sugar farmers .
That is why I voted against this report .
.
The Constitutional Treaty will not be ratified without clearly established borders , enabling us to say which of the countries of Eurasia are not cut out to join the EU and which should be making active preparations for accession .
One of the reasons why disability has not been given the attention it deserves may be a failure to understand and appreciate the potential of what might seem a powerless group , namely the disabled and their families .
They requested that the EU raise the matter with Japan , and I agree with the previous speaker that we have been somewhat neglectful of this issue .
Mr President , have not the Sudanese people suffered long enough ?
However , as we discuss Cambodia , I am struck by the fact that we have been here before , and that we have heard all this before .
Ladies and gentlemen , before beginning our plenary sitting , I believe that , under the circumstances , the Presidency must make a short statement relating to the two tragic events that have taken place in two countries of the European Union .
I would like to tell you that we are continuing to work very hard with the African Union to try to resolve the problem of peace in Darfur .
We know how important these elections will be .
Mr President , a common foreign and security policy that promotes Europe &apos;s values in the world and brings peace and security to our neighbours is what Liberals and Democrats strive for .
Mr President , when , exactly one week ago , I was observing the Palestinian elections on behalf of this House , one giant banner , in particular , caught my eye .
There are serious difficulties inherent in adopting decisive positions regarding Europe &apos;s Common Security and Defence Policy ( ECSDP ) and the European Security and Defence Policy ( ESDP ) .
If Russia starts to make its energy policy an instrument of nationalist policy , then we must make our own - or at least part of it - more European .
Of course , such diplomacy sometimes needs patience .
I think this is clearly a principled position .
We must search for peace , but we must never forget that we are talking about real people .
It therefore appears perverse that the threat should today be made to turn off the flow of European funding to the Palestinian Authority .
However , being elected and taking office is also a matter of political responsibility .
The intention here , amongst other things , was to begin to prepare the ground for what many of us hope will be an imminent transition to democracy .
Therefore we , the representatives of European democracies , must be aware of our especially great responsibility when discussing one of the last Communist regimes .
Despite the differences in administrative arrangements between the various Member States , the Council advocates that general common principles and elements regarding internal controls should be drawn up .
I have to say that I found the Minister &apos;s performance a disappointing one ; he has not really answered our question , and that at a time when confidence in the European Union is at an all time low .
This report was adopted - firstly in committee , and then in plenary - back in June .
Last year , this Parliament roundly condemned Sinn Féin - the IRA - for its continuing criminal activities .
More than 300 years ago , the British philosopher , John Locke , introduced a fundamental idea : a government should be regarded as a tool for the defence of fundamental rights , the most fundamental civil right being the right to life and physical safety .
I therefore hope that , after this debate , things do not simply continue as they have been .
This means that victims of domestic murders were living in our midst , not in some distant location .
With this in mind , I would like to call for equal opportunities for children too .
There are therefore always very lively discussions both in committee and here in Parliament .
When UKIP vote on this report , it will vote in accordance with the wishes of UK citizens .
It was adopted by 28 votes in favour , with one abstention .
Given the complexity of &apos; unit pricing , &quot; such protection laws will ensure that the current sale of the British pint of milk is not put at risk .
Mr President , we are right to be concerned about the European Union &apos;s communication problems and we are right , as the title of this White Paper puts it , to be debating Europe and to be involving people .
It is too early to say what we need for the concrete proposals because we are carrying out consultations about that .
Moreover , the conciliation procedure has enabled further progress to be made .
I believe that we need these rules if we are to achieve certain improvements , even if we do not yet have the coherence with the Working Time Directive that is needed .
Mr President , after more than 20 years , the legislation we have on social conditions in road transport is due an overhaul .
Their day @-@ to @-@ day work consists in moving goods and passengers across the whole of our continent .
I hope that the commotion accompanying my speech is only the expression of widespread approval , even if Parliament may have some regrets about not having been fully supported by the Council .
The regulation on the harmonisation of social legislation relating to road transport was intended to introduce into the road transport sector uniform rules on working conditions and safety on the road that had been needed for a long time .
I have personal experience of this .
It is , for example , unacceptable that Austrian postal legislation should impose disproportionately high sanctions on those who omit to fit new letterboxes on their houses .
I will have no part in it .
Somehow or other , then , we have to get some structure behind what we are doing , and so I will now put it to you that if the motion from the Liberal Group was called for debate despite being received outside the specified timeframe , then there is no less justification for my colleague Mr Swoboda &apos;s motion that , it having been decided that a resolution is to be drafted , we ask that the vote on it be deferred until the next mini @-@ plenary in Brussels , which is the first possible opportunity to do so .
We are prepared to provide it , but at a distance .
Mr President , this request does not imply any cost to the institution .
In addition , I would just like to state briefly that the World Bank recently issued a report setting out the financial benefits of the application of a welfare policy to animals and illustrating that there is also a financial benefit from these policies .
It is not very sensible , though , if we want to stress what are referred to as non @-@ trade aspects , to table yet another fresh proposal in the middle of discussions in the World Trade Organisation , without knowing for certain that the importers comply .
Madam President , I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the thoroughness with which he has done his job .

I greatly appreciate the interest and involvement of the European Parliament in the process of reforming the rules of State aid .

We need better to protect the use of State aid so that funds are delivered to where they are needed and not , as previously used to happen , squandered to no good purpose .
It is a challenge to ensure that all those SMEs can take advantage of these opportunities .
High social and environmental standards are a laudable outcome of European civilisation , which has declared itself responsible for the long @-@ term sustainable development of the planet .
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon .
SOLVIT is a type of instrument which allows the European Union to ascertain whether legislation adopted is being applied appropriately by Member States .
In July 2005 , the Commission adopted my proposal on a draft directive on car taxation , which is intended to remove existing tax obstacles to the transfer of passenger cars from one Member State to another and thus improve the functioning of the internal market .
The vote will take place on Tuesday at 12 noon .
Why should people in general cough up for the costs that business imposes on public health services simply because of the negligent attitude taken towards certain risks ?
It is important to underline that we call for these subcommittees to include and to consult representatives of parliaments and of organisations representing civil society .
Before the democratically elected Authority had the chance to organise itself , the EU @-@ Palestine Agreement was up for review on the basis of human rights in a way that has been dismissed by both the Council and the Commission as unhelpful because it would remove leverage .
Despite huge human rights concerns and EU influence in the Middle East , human rights clauses have never been invoked in relations with Egypt , Israel or Tunisia , in the latter case despite strong EU statements last year on curbs on freedom of expression and the blocking of NGO funding .
Is anyone prepared to sacrifice trade contracts with China in exchange for the release of Tibetan monks imprisoned for alleged subversive activities ?
But let us be realistic : we cannot change the world in a day .
They will open the door to mutual cooperation in the border regions , provided of course that we reject the measures to which Mr Lax alluded .
We were delighted to note that the biomass action plan included the announcement of the eventual production of a directive .
Politicians talk more about the need to use renewables than those who take the real decisions in this area , that is to say the general public .
We are sure that the Commission will respond once again to these expectations .
Mr President , on a point of order , while you are probably the best Vice @-@ President we have in this Parliament , you have already made two mistakes today !
Mr President , I am in complete agreement with the previous two speakers .
The European Union is sacrificing our jobs , our industries , our agriculture and our social protection systems on the altar of global free trade and the dogma of international competition ; it does not protect our economies from unfair competition or social or monetary dumping , or from piracy and counterfeiting ; it does not support our businesses when they are faced with multiple tariff and non @-@ tariff barriers in the competing countries where they want to trade , or when they are faced with increased competition at home , because our economies are some of the most open in the world ; it piles on the disabling standards and regulations .
Mr President , this important report highlights an important potential for Europe .
Mr President , since its birth two years ago , this proposal has been in the headlines .
I am pretty certain that what I have described is what Mr Bolkestein wanted .
It is going to give us a free market , liberal economics and the solution to all our woes .
Some are here to try and hang on to what they already have .
I also want to thank our colleagues in the ALDE and UEN Groups who helped us achieve a very important result in the committee back in November .
Thus , for example , the proportion of the older Member States in total added value in the European Union construction sector constitutes 95 % , while in the business services sphere the percentage is even greater : 98 % .
I would agree that health should be taken out of this directive ; it should never have been there in the first place , and many of us look forward to a speedy proposal from the Commission on the issues of patient mobility and not service mobility , which is why it should not have been in the directive in the first place .
As soon as Charlie McCreevy and the Commission send us the new , revised , proposal at the end of April , which will to a large extent be based on Parliament &apos;s work , and make it public , we will do all we can to make as much progress on this dossier as possible .
The European Commission is also monitoring Serbia @-@ Montenegro &apos;s cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal during the negotiations for the Stabilisation and Association Agreement .
.
That would be to prejudice the negotiations .
We all know that a massive increase in energy prices would trigger high inflation and could considerably slow economic growth or even result in recession .
Mr President , Mr Barroso , Mr Winkler , it is one thing to complete the internal market , which is an objective that we share .
Once everything runs along smoothly in the temporary employment sector , I for one will be in favour of bringing this sector within the scope of the Services Directive , but that point has still not yet been reached , what matters now is that this Temporary Employment Directive be put back on track .
On Thursday we have two choices .
- Mr President , the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left is calling for the withdrawal of the proposed Bolkestein directive and , in all events , we are seeking the abolition of the principle of the country of origin which is being maintained under the new name of the &apos; principle of the free provision of services &apos; .
The directive must be adopted with the widest possible scope , which means that services of general interest or services of general economic interest - and it is perhaps time we defined those terms - that are currently on offer should fall within its scope without further ado , just like health care , temporary employment agencies and gambling .
Finally , Mr President , I would like to make a brief observation .
This pressure poses a threat to the health services .
We are told not to mix up commercial and non @-@ commercial services .
I find it difficult to understand or justify why services were left out of that enterprise .
However , driving down workers &quot; rights , wages and health and safety measures has no part in creating a dynamic service sector and that is why I will be voting for amendments that exclude labour law and free collective bargaining from the scope of the directive .
It is also important for us to emphasise that these innovative funding methods always involve additional resources .
Our point of departure is that as human beings we are free , independent , equal and responsible .
Let us not forget the many years of social and economic frustrations in many Muslim societies .
People could be put in jail in Denmark for burning the Koran .
On the contrary , over the last 18 years , Iran has failed to declare a substantial part of its very extensive nuclear programme to the IAEA , and is still refusing to provide it with important information concerning , in particular , the extent of development of its uranium @-@ enrichment technology and the field of &apos; weaponisation &quot; - that is , the militarisation of its nuclear programme .
This is a logic that also needs to be discussed , one that was triggered by a pre @-@ emptive strike carried out in the same region in the past , which was utterly wrong and which we vehemently opposed .
This strategy should , however , also include preparing possible sanctions decided on in the UN Security Council .
We must , however , be clear , firm and principled in our attitude towards totalitarian regimes .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that a crucial point is that , in the international community , and obviously in our Europe , there cannot and must not be any divisions where tackling relations with Iran is concerned .
In all of your duties you have demonstrated your undeniable commitment to Europe , to European values , to Austria &apos;s cause in Europe and to Europe &apos;s cause in the world .
Speaking , indeed , as an Austrian , and therefore as someone who saw this going on so to speak over his own back fence , I can say that it seems to me of the essence that we who , ten years ago , watched in horrified fascination the incredible savagery and warfare and the people &apos;s suffering , can today say with some satisfaction that there is only slight likelihood of an armed conflict there .
They should be building more on the rights of individuals , of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( and tomorrow citizens of the European Union ) , and less on affiliation to religious and ethnic groups .
There is also the Reis @-@ ul @-@ Ulema in Bosnia and Herzegovina itself , which , along with other institutions , is important as a manifestation of a European Islam , and the Christian faith communities in this country , represented by such outstanding personalities as Bishop Komarica , should also be actively involved in the peace process and accepted as legal entities .
With the promotion of democracy in Belarus in mind , the Council is still willing to make a serious commitment to it and to cooperation with international partners ; at the meeting with Mr Milinkevich that I mentioned earlier , we discussed the ways in which we might help the civil society there in its campaign for democracy , and what options are open to us as regards exerting direct influence on those elements in Belarus that are campaigning for democracy .
It does not know to what it should aspire .
This is indeed disappointing , but not a surprising decision , given the situation in the country .
The breakdown of appropriations between the various components of Heading 1a has not yet been decided .
Activities are provided for under the strand of research infrastructure that would have important implications for some regions in Europe , and , last but not least , the Eranet and the Eranet + activities that will also involve research players at regional level .
Even if we were now to remove the incentives , which were , at the outset - if we are frank - financed through the framework programme , this is now a process with its own story . It will definitely make a change at European Union level .
Secondly , the aid must be in keeping with the common agricultural policy in general and , thirdly , such aid must of course be compatible with the international commitments we have entered into .
I note your particular interest in option 2 , which concerns mutual funds .
In fact , private insurance companies are considered to be a basic mechanism for implementing the proposed measures .
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for tackling the problem of risk and crisis management in the agricultural sector .
In this connection , the Member States are particularly called on to provide those affected with more information on the opportunities available .
I therefore believe that the future European forest plan must opt clearly for a policy for preserving our forests and enhancing and making the best possible use of the immense resources obtained from forest soil .
This subject is doubtless relevant to the whole of the European Union , in which 60 % of forests are managed by 15 million private owners and the average size of a privately @-@ owned forest is only around 13 ha .
Thanks to the excellent cooperation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission , our rural development regulation was adopted last autumn .
The strengthening of quality products and of local products is also very important .
It is high time that provision was made for its development .
Particular attention should be paid to the removal of barriers for those whose access to the labour market is currently hampered because of their gender , age or disability .
The next item is the one @-@ minute speeches on matters of political importance .
In addition , we had a hearing in this Parliament about the high @-@ level working group .
- the oral question to the Commission on EU measures against trafficking in human beings and the launch of an anti @-@ trafficking day , by Karin Riis @-@ Jørgensen and Elizabeth Lynne , on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe ( O @-@ 0011 / 2006 B6 @-@ 0011 / 2006 ) ,
We want to see all women given the right to their sexuality , and on equal conditions and without being oppressed .
That study gave us a strong indication that criminalising the demand for trafficking has a very strong impact and that it substantially lowers the number of girls and young women being trafficked .
This framework decision was supposed to have been transposed by August 2004 .
In any case , we will not stand for any &apos; subsidy hopping . &quot;
- Mr President , last month Commissioner Danuda Hubner stated during an interview with a French financial newspaper that we need to facilitate relocation within the European Union .
This would be the best way of ensuring that economic activities continue in these regions .
The report by the UN which was published last week , entitled &apos; Water : A Shared Responsibility , &quot; says that the reason for the unsatisfactory situation in the world with regard to water is largely poor administration .
The Commission has been asked to ensure , within the scope of the various Community mechanisms and instruments in the field of civil protection , that greater attention is paid to those regions that are isolated and more remote due to geographical , territorial and socio @-@ economic characteristics and to integrate civil protection measures into teaching modules and communication and information campaigns with a view to increasing awareness of the need to prevent , prepare for , and respond rapidly to , major emergencies and to guaranteeing the involvement of civil society in prevention and response measures .
We had thirteen such interventions and , of course , the two very big crises in South @-@ East Asia with the tsunami , where the European Union was , through the civil protection mechanism , the first to send representatives to the area .
That decision is long overdue .
Spanish workers never created problems in the host countries ; on the contrary .
It is time to break the stereotypes of the old way of thinking and to understand that freedom and healthy competition are the engine of progress in Europe .
Meanwhile , however , many Member States have been protecting their monopolies for many years , and so they have had the money to penetrate the markets in those Member States which opened up their markets on time .
. - Mr President , I would like firstly to thank the Commissioner for the report drawn up by the Commission .
I assume that the Commissioner has pondered this issue and I would like to hear her opinion on the subject of relevant information now , at the same time as she greets this important official .
To conclude , I think that , alongside the social partners and beyond any party political affiliations , we can help to provide support for restructuring in order to win the employment battle .
. This report addresses one of the main problems currently facing the EU , one which has serious ramifications in terms of unemployment , economic and social inequality and which hampers the development and even leads to the abandonment of vast areas .
Later in the report , however , it is suggested that restructuring should not be used to increase business profitability by reducing the numbers of workers .
The work continued for five years , and debate was thorough ; in 2000 the European Council of Nice acknowledged the need for a tool to promote the exchange of experience and for sharing information on equality between men and women .
So be it . I therefore enquired if this equality stems from the law of nature or from statute law , and what can be done to enable men to bear children .
On this basis , EU institutions would take effective measures and would demand the same of national governments .
What we regard as central is the inalienable value of all human beings , in all their uniqueness , along with their dignity and freedom .
- a blue EU passport , and much more .
I therefore welcome the proposal for a Council regulation and the European Parliament &apos;s report , specifically regarding the concept of prevention in shaping an EU response to natural disasters .
. The EPLP welcomes close coordination of Member States in negotiations inside the IMF .
The quantity used for production is minimal , and its environmental risk , since it is contained in glass , relatively small .
This does not support the thesis - a thesis that we all believe should be defended - that the true beneficiaries of the process of trade liberalisation should be the consumers .
However , Vietnam , 30 years ago and even 10 years ago , was a very poor country , probably poorer than many sub @-@ Saharan African countries .
Faced with the evidence of such a violation of commercial practices , the European Union has a duty to react and to repair the damage caused to the Community industry , and this in accordance with WTO rules .
I am seriously concerned about the increasing protectionism I encounter in the EU , and I hope that this is the last time the Commission gives way to the demands of protectionists at the expense of citizens .
This certainly does not deprive Member States of their right to express an opinion on the case or to receive detailed replies from the Commission &apos;s services .
All of us who are active in this field found this state of affairs intolerable .
Could the Commissioner tell us if the warrant has now been correctly implemented in the country he knows best and whether any other Member States are dragging their heels , and will he start proceedings against any Member State that has misapplied the law or limited its effects ?
As Mr Mayor Oreja said , we welcome the creation of the European Arrest Warrant as an innovative and highly effective step in developing judicial cooperation and stepping up cooperation and mutual trust .
We are also giving particular attention to guaranteeing the presence of local and international observers at the trials of opposition leaders and of other persons .
This position has not changed ; a fact that was revealed once more on the last two occasions on which we were able to discuss the Middle East peace process and the situation in the Middle East , namely at the last General Affairs Council and at the informal meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs , or &apos; Gymnich meeting , &quot; in Salzburg last weekend .
I consider it vital that we carry out a great deal of work in the Member States on obtaining information from the courts , so that the required information can be transferred from the courts to the public .
The Minister has been very gracious .
I therefore strongly believe that the new programmes for voluntary groups and young people in the field of education , as well as culture , should be enhanced in quantitative and qualitative terms , as they are of such importance both to individuals and to the Community as a whole .
Our estimation is that there are some old models of vending machines that are more difficult to adjust , but the majority of new ones can be properly adjusted so that they can take the correct coins .
I must reiterate that the decision @-@ makers are the Board of Governors , along with the working party - the - which includes parents and other interested parties .
In my report I would have liked to emphasise that social inclusion represents added value to the Lisbon process .
Despite the number of efforts made by our government at the moment , you see that the share of the poorest 10 % in the population &apos;s net income is 2.8 % , while that of the richest 10 % is 28 % : ten times as much .
It is unacceptable that 15 % of European citizens , approximately 68 million people , live with the awareness of the risk of poverty , as described in the European Commission report released on 27 January , 2005 .
We have had a reference to information tools .
Mr Blair and his government may think themselves very clever in avoiding a proper debate on the EU at the last general election .
The amendment to the Financial Regulation has been an immense job of preparation , and one that is very technical and tough @-@ going .
This also means , however , that the Commission &apos;s work should be increasingly judged by its efficiency in future .
The fisheries sector is having a tough time , not least due to increasing oil prices .
The Committee on Fisheries adopted a report in January , the purpose of which is to promote environmentally @-@ friendly fishing methods by proposing various technical measures , such as the definition of fishing areas , fishing periods and fishing tools .
It would have been good if Mr Abbas had been able to take advantage of this situation , but that has now been postponed .
We are therefore faced now with an extremely serious event which , as Mr Brok has just said , is aimed at undermining the man who is the guarantor of stability between Palestine and Israel but who is also the guarantor of resistance to Hamas , which he would see become a force for peace .
However , continuing to reduce unemployment , which currently affects almost 19.5 million people , and increasing productivity and growth potential are still the greatest challenges for the European Union .
The Commission will exercise its prerogatives if companies abuse their dominant position in the market .
.
The Constitution proposes that ratifications be allowed to continue until 80 % of the countries have approved the Constitution , at which point a special summit would take place .
Jeopardising the internal market is a sin against the unemployed of Europe , to whom we have obligations , in that it is for their sakes , for the sake of the weakest members of our society , that we have to make Lisbon a success .
In conclusion , Mr Winkler and Mr Barroso , I should like to say that the European Council will be judged on two counts : on the one hand , the lessons it will draw from Parliament &apos;s vote on the &apos; Services &quot; Directive - there must , emphatically , be no return to Bolkestein - and , on the other hand , freedom of movement for workers from the new Member States within the European Union .
To go on as we are doing now will set us thinking in the wrong way .
The report from the European Commission , which has already been mentioned here , stresses that labour mobility , not only between the new and old Member States , but also within the &apos; old &quot; EU , is still insufficient .
When we , in twenty @-@ first century Europe , use the term &apos; growth &apos; , we cannot be talking about any kind of growth other than that which is sustainable , socially defensible and environmentally responsible .
The amendments that are being proposed , such as the introduction of the Community Fishing Fleet Register number and the staggering of the fishing methods used by the vessel , are important elements not included in the original regulation .
However , we take the view that the resolution should extend to include all prostitution .
To prevent &apos; subsidy tourism , &quot; the report argues that firms subsidised from EU funds should not receive any further Community aid for a given period of time if they relocate part or all of their activities within the EU .
.
With regard to enlargement , Mr President , in view of the comments by the French Home Affairs Minister , Mr Sarkozy , to the effect that there is a degree of fatigue when it comes to enlargement and his request for a debate in the Council in June on assessing the limits to the European Union &apos;s capacity for absorption − and Mr Brok &apos;s report is the next item on the agenda − I would like to know whether the Commission agrees with Mr Sarkozy &apos;s request to the Council and whether it believes that the Austrian Presidency of the Union should provide a definitive response to the issue of the geographical limits of our political project .
I fully share my group chairman &apos;s reaction to the deplorable and unacceptable behaviour of Israel in Jericho yesterday , not to mention the strange behaviour - to say the least - of US and British troops .
We should not undermine the EU perspective , which is the foundation of security and stability in the region .
As far as Kosovo is concerned , I agree that attention should be paid during negotiations to its final status , but we also need to prepare ourselves for how the decision taken on the final status of Kosovo is to be applied .
As far as I can gather , no progress whatsoever is being made with regard to this important item of the political criteria of Copenhagen .
It is not very smart for us to take them EUR 139 million in the occupied areas and for them to pelt the members of the European Parliament with eggs and stones .
Rather than doing as you used to do , and using populism as a club - the term is your own - with which to beat your former party leaders or leading candidates , you have now hit yourselves over the head with it .
That does not mean that every European country must apply or that the EU must accept every country , but at the same time it means that it is not sensible to close the door forever by drawing a line across the map to define Europe once and for all , which would seriously damage our possibilities of having a beneficial influence and strategic leverage in our immediate neighbourhood .
I think there should be a proactive approach and I shall mention three questions on which we should have a thorough debate in Europe .
You have the reputation of being a tough cookie , and we would appreciate it if , in the next few weeks , you could give us reason to believe that that reputation is warranted .
While the effects of individual mergers must be assessed on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis in accordance - there is no doubt about this - with the relevant competition rules , mergers between companies based in different Member States are likely to increase competition .
We regret the offence caused by those cartoons to Muslims across the world , but we also strongly condemned all violent acts and threats against individuals and property of the European Union and other countries .
Therefore I wish to ask both the Commission as well as the Council to tell us what is their opinion about this study and what measures they intend to take to address any negative impact which could be brought about by the setting up of a free trade area in the Mediterranean .
.
However , on the other hand , we are also comforted by its declaration expressing the wish to work with the Human Rights Council .
Furthermore , the work and the operation of the Council will be reviewed after five years , which will enable us to overcome the deficiencies of the new mechanism : one of the most ambitious objectives of the final document of the September Summit .
It has been pointed out repeatedly that the election of members of the Human Rights Council is of the utmost importance .
I am convinced that the greater responsibilities given by the Member States , the precise terms articulating the procedure and the new system of oppositions , address the need for faster and more efficient recognition , that is to say for a quick check that is also endowed with the crucial characteristic of completeness .
All too often , sadly , we find examples of counterfeiting : the largest market in southern Italy , Vittoria in Sicily , is every day flooded with counterfeit products that are put on the market as protected geographical indication products , for example Pachino cherry tomatoes .
- Mr President , I must first add my tribute to the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for his remarkable work aimed at providing better information and better protection for producers , manufacturers and consumers .
That problem is the specific role of tariffs in the liberal legal professions , since , in many EU Member States , these have a special nature and importance , especially in connection with the rules for reimbursement of legal expenses , and also in situations in which companies providing legal @-@ expenses insurance wish to make reimbursements themselves on behalf of their clients .
The conclusions are : first , strengthening the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity and monitoring progress towards achieving the 2010 biodiversity target ; secondly , making progress in implementing the programme of work on protected areas of the Convention on Biological Diversity , and in particular on its objective to establish a global network of comprehensive , ecologically representative and effectively managed national and regional protected area systems .
Thank you very much .
Secondly , it should include patient health mobility issues : with more and more people travelling , we have got to get the health card right .
It has come to my notice that a single application can cost as much as a few thousand euros .
There is a similar problem with consumer protection , which is sometimes nothing but high @-@ sounding phrases because of the predominance of wealthy monopolies on the market which look after their own interests and pour vast resources into advertising .
We have half a diabetic nurse post to cater for 250 people , when there should be one for 50 people in order to be effective .
Providing clear information , backed by scientific research , could go a long way in preventing much suffering and also avoid misunderstandings .
I will make a few brief comments .
We therefore regret the fact that the report focuses too much on the EU &apos;s own capacity for absorption , because it can give the impression that the European Parliament questions the EU &apos;s ability to include more Member States .
Unfortunately , those criminals who do not have a sense of individual responsibility , and do not recognise the right of others to condemn their actions , are rarely mature enough for feelings such as repentance . We must therefore support any actions that will force them to answer the questions : why did they kill , why did they rape , why did they torture ?
Mr President , I had no intention of speaking following the heartfelt speech of my colleague , Mrs Dührkop , but following the speech by the Vice @-@ President , Mr Vidal @-@ Quadras , I just wished to say one thing , because I believe that all of us here are united in calling for European democrats to come together in order to support this process .
.
We therefore call on you to make an agreement and to work for an agreement , but subject to our conditions , which ought also to be yours .
Education is especially important , too , when we consider that we are a continent of immigration .
When it comes to energy efficiency , we feel that the transport sector is crucial .
Let me give you a simple example . Recently a delegation of Lithuanian lecturers paid a visit .
This is because we need to cooperate with our partners and with our neighbours in order to take their problems into account .
Even wind power , for which Europe has significant offshore potential , requires substantial investment to make the networks secure .
Proposals , as included in the Green Paper , go in the right direction , although they are still too modest .
The European Union is promoting the policy of liberalisation by sacrificing the satisfaction of grass @-@ roots requirements to the profitability of private investors .
We need a realistic and sensible debate .
Prices are increasing dramatically for industry and for private consumers .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m .
In these conditions , and in order to increase the security of forthcoming elections , the UN has sought the help of the European Union , as you mentioned .
I would also take issue with the assertion that the tenth EDF represents a significant improvement on the ninth EDF .
We are therefore in the realms of virtual reality here .
The current situation is a glaring contravention of the principles enshrined in the Convention .
The next item is the debate on the report by Mrs Morgantini , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on the development impact of Economic Partnership Agreements ( 2005 / 2162 ( INI ) ) ( A6 @-@ 0053 / 2006 ) .
The economic partnership agreements are very complex and complicated for the ACP and are the most complex and complicated negotiations they have ever engaged in .
I share the fears of our ACP partners and of many NGOs with regard to the way in which negotiations are now conducted by the Commission and with regard to the logic underlying these negotiations .
Politics is an unpredictable business and in the case of unforeseeable events it must be possible to spend a certain amount in the next quarter , so that the parties do not have to embark on an end @-@ of @-@ year spending spree in December .
What we have set up and what we are hoping to improve is a system where we have - and the public can see that we have - a clear , transparent and fair system for funding the European level of work of political parties .
Mr President , this resolution speaks of the gulf between the public and the European institutions .
I congratulate him .
I am very prudent in not promising what could come out of the review of the Financial Regulation now .
I therefore believe that it is important that we begin to think about defined legal instruments of an obligatory nature that are not merely recommendations .
Why not , indeed , appoint a special EU representative for Belarus ?
What we have had trouble with , however , is answering the question of what we should do about it .
As Members of the European Parliament , we shall regularly ask the Commission to update us on how it is carrying out its work and whether the procedure for transferring and spending the aid has been improved .
The status quo is not an option .
That has implications for flexibility on the labour market , flexibility all through life and flexibility in working hours .
Where there are no forests , then we can grow willows and miscanthus to make sure that we can produce energy supply .
However , I do not believe in pan @-@ European actions on these matters , particularly in relation to setting obligatory targets .
&apos;any executive agency created or extended to administer this programme &quot;
Some of the figures paint a very clear picture :
The ultimate outcome for you would be if they were authorised to participate as such in national and local ballots , thereby allowing unacceptable political meddling at all levels of decision making in the Member States .
We have voted in favour of the report on the promotion of crops for non @-@ food purposes because we think it is a good idea for farmers to plant crops other than the traditional ones when the latter no longer pay their way .
Many speakers are listed and , once again , I must warn you that , unless you all conform strictly to the speaking time of one minute , it will not be possible for everybody who has asked to speak to do so , particularly if there are further requests for the floor during the sitting , as is always the case .
This Convention does indeed stipulate that , in the event of an internal conflict , the government is obliged - in line with the commitment it made previously - to conclude humanitarian agreements in order to save as many human lives as possible .
Some of them remain in prison to this day .
In Malta , even refugees from war zones , in particular Darfur , are being refused asylum .
- The next item is the recommendation for second reading of the report by Anne Laperrouze , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the guidelines for trans @-@ European energy networks and on the annulment of decision no 96 / 391 / EC and decision no ( 10720 / 1 / 2005 - C6 @-@ 0016 / 2006 - 2003 / 0297 ( COD ) ) ( A6 @-@ 0071 / 2006 ) .
Mr President , looking at the energy policy controversy between the Council and the European Parliament , we cannot but ask ourselves : is the Union to be an institution in appearance only , is it just to pretend to take action , is it to be a theatre of fiction ?
Without the creation of the Trans @-@ European Network , as the most important priority in terms of EU energy security and economic competitiveness , the EU will remain on the periphery of the energy market .
During 2004 , the Commission completed its modernisation package .
Therefore , keep the four freedoms in mind ; they are under attack , much like competition policy in general .
In order to increase the ordinary citizens &quot; interest in and commitment to the European Union , and in view of the current constitutional crisis , Europe needs to take courageous and imaginative steps to bring European issues closer to everyone .
We hope that the European Parliament will continue to help matters along and we expect great things of the general consultation we shall be carrying out between July and October .
The alternative would be opinions of reduced quality . Parliamentarians involved in a particular issue should , however , be allowed in certain instances to study the legal opinions , once they have undertaken in writing to observe the confidentiality that applies to everyone else who has had a part to play in the matter .
I personally think it is a fantastic idea to open up the Council meetings .
We need to understand the pressures on , and aspirations of , our partners .
The results in Hong Kong were modest - we debated this back in January - but a road map was drawn up , with established time limits , the first being this 30 April .
I also think that globalisation is the best thing that has happened to us over the past 150 years .
For ten years now , the WTO has been overseeing the complex business of international trade .
They may well , though , be adapted to take account of changed realities and the insights that we gain from experience , and that will , of course be necessary , but we do not , at present , see any reason why these guidelines should be amended for 2006 ; they are still a sound basis for the dialogues in which the Commission is currently engaged with the Member States , the object of which is to get the national reform programmes actually up and running .
- Mr President , Commissioner Verheugen , Commissioner Almunia , Commissioner Špidla , ladies and gentlemen , we all agree that the European single market presents us with our great opportunity , a great opportunity for us , with our 450 million people or thereabouts , to find our own way through globalisation , a way that must be marked by economic prosperity and sound finances , while also producing results that are real to ordinary people .
Once suitably long @-@ term , integrated Guidelines are in place , it is incredibly important for us to examine the National Reform Programmes .
We have a very strong currency which prohibits exports ; look at the exports the cheap dollar is giving the United States of America .

Thank you for your attention , and I would like to thank all my colleagues , the political groups and the European Commission for their cooperation .
I therefore believe that it is essential to lift all barriers that might hinder the free movement of workers across Europe in any way .
Is it not , perhaps , that they are thereby enabled to make money from cheap seasonal labour , from the putative self @-@ employed , and from those working in the black market ?
Many in my group support the text as it now stands , feeling that we should be against any continuation of transitional measures .
The trans @-@ European energy networks will foster interconnections , interoperability and the development of energy networks in the enlarged Europe , and in turn stimulate the effective operation of the internal market .
I only hope we will see the aims of this report backed up by action .
I have to advise the Irish Government to pay careful attention to this space , where our freedom is threatened , and to defend it most vigorously .
Millions of people are still , every Tuesday , taking to the streets to protest .
If we must adopt a directive on the free movement of services , because doing so is a real necessity , then it will not be at any price .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you for the discussion that has just taken place .
Let us be clear .
We must avoid rules that are too prescriptive , that lead to unwarranted expense , or that may turn out to be counter @-@ productive .
Finally , the quest for simplification must also lead to the implementation of legislation that is better drawn up , whereby Parliament defines the principles and the rest is left to comitology .
I am grateful to the rapporteurs for having worked out some very definite measures , albeit in amidst all this fog , particularly to Mrs Frassoni for her report with its concrete proposals for improved monitoring of the process of transposing Community law , for speedier infringement proceedings and greater transparency for those citizens who bring complaints .
We have three linked issues in this plenary session .
I believe that we should always bear in mind with regard to better lawmaking that the aim of all these reports on the subject is not , of course , to improve the familiarity of the individual citizen with the legal texts , but to provide Member States with a simple text to help with transposition .
When European integration was still in its infancy , the attitude towards the adoption of legislation was quite different from that which prevails today , and , going back a little further , astonishing things are to be found in the annals of our statute books .
The procedures must be followed .
.
However , sometimes realism and the challenge of timing are also important .
We cannot therefore ignore them or amend them .
Regarding this , I want to thank Marianne Mikko in particular , as it was she who made a strong case for the Stalinist component and wanted it to be included .
As it happens , we can only fund a very limited number of programmes .
The price rises as your rights go .
The &apos; active European remembrance &quot; campaign has been included in this programme for the first time , as the committee is of the opinion that European history needs to be discussed in the context of a broad public .
Anyone wanting to actively shape the future needs to be aware of his past , which is why action 4 , &apos; active European remembrance , &quot; is so important .
If I take as an example the city of Linz , which now has an investment volume of EUR 60 million , but only 0.86 % of this comes from the EU , I do wonder why the burdens are so great .
I do not have time to go into detail .
So , having chopped it in two and taken the highly dubious step of dividing the regulation between two legal bases - the main thrust being environment , with some ancillary provisions grounded on the single market legal base - the Council handed the baton back to Parliament .
But having said that , while my Group can live with the directive on mobile air @-@ conditioning - although in our view it is still too weak - we cannot accept the results of the conciliation on the regulation on F @-@ gases , in spite of Mrs Doyle &apos;s good offices to try to get a better deal , but which ultimately failed .
There is , in fact , such a thing as substitution .
I know it was difficult .
Surely , to subsidise your economic competitors is the economics of the madhouse !
There may well have been a time when we could all , off our own bat , create national champions or believe ourselves capable of disregarding European regulations , but those days are gone .
That approach of partnership between the Council , the Commission and Parliament is essential .
I welcome in particular the Commission &apos;s decision this week to mount legal challenges to those flouting the rules of liberalisation , because that is the kind of action that we need from the Commission to make progress .
It is late in coming , but it is on the way , and I hope that we will get some statements in this half of the year .
Now Europe &apos;s energy supply is heading for a crisis , and it is the same old story .
I would like to make a few brief comments , firstly , on the objectives : What would we like to see ?
.
We can also build confidence by showing that the European Union is willing and able to engage in new common initiatives in sectors where we face new challenges that cannot be tackled by individual countries on their own .
It is also good that the EU institutions provide information about their activities and about the rights and duties attendant on European citizenship .
The preparations are already underway , and it remains to be seen whether they are being made with the necessary foresight .
In 2004 , the United Kingdom , Ireland and Sweden opened up their borders without restriction .
Mr President , I think Mr Solana has already covered nearly everything , but let me add a few comments because the Commission is facing a very difficult period of profound and rapid change in the Middle East .
Mr President , Mrs Ferrero @-@ Waldner , Mr Solana , those with a sound knowledge of Israeli society assure us , in the wake of the elections , that the majority of the country &apos;s population are now resolved to accept , willingly or not , the idea that the occupation of the Palestinian territories is , in every respect , a deadlock that needs to be broken .
It is quite clear that corrections will still need to be made - we all know that , if we are realistic - but if even the principle is not accepted , there will be difficulties .
Naturally , we also have to support Mahmoud Abbas .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the outcome of the most recent Israeli elections confirms that the road taken by Prime Minister Sharon towards a form of peace in the Middle East that is acceptable to both Palestinians and Israelis is the right one , partly because it is perhaps the only one possible .
That is the first point I wanted to make .
Some measures can be taken by the Commission , some by the Council and some by us as Members of Parliament .
The Council will also look into other possible sanctions and measures , in which connection we really must be very careful not to take any action that ultimately does the opposite of what we want to achieve .
That does not represent the views of either my group or this Parliament .
Nonetheless , such a statement needs to be made , because only an offer of this nature will suffice to spur internal forces into action to develop democracy and the free market economy .
Furthermore , I would highlight the fact that the regulatory committee created by the framework regulation of 2002 has worked hard and has made it possible for eight implementing regulations to be adopted .
So if we take this route and use public money , we should ensure that people and air passengers will actually gain something tangible from it .
I believe that dialogue is the means of choice because I doubt very much whether we would achieve the desired result if we started speaking about trade sanctions .
This question , too , naturally affects the progress of negotiations on fundamental rights and liberties , which are dealt with in a chapter of their own .
As I asked in the question , what is the Council doing or what action is it considering to ensure that the decision is enforced and that consumers are helped and receive the rights to which they are clearly entitled , as proven by the ECJ ruling ?
Indeed , we have tonight agreed to provide EUR 500 million more direct funding for the TEN projects and an additional EUR 500 million to obtain EIB loans .
In our resolution , we are right to focus on the shortage of health workers , often caused by brain drain , a phenomenon whereby highly trained doctors and nurses decide to work elsewhere in the world .
Within this context , I believe that , in its programmes , Europe must allocate more money to training , but at the same time control the distribution of aid much more effectively and prevent that corruption , which is a permanent obstacle , thereby putting to an end to the frustration of the people treating the sick .
Simply launching one appeal after another and celebrating World Health Days is not enough .
I hope that the World Health Day will draw our attention even more to this important area , and will bring the solution closer .
The decision on the proportion of financing allocated by countries to human and social development is ultimately a question for national governments .
Let us stop making a crisis out of a drama .
Sales and exports were reduced , and certain countries imposed import restrictions , banning the import of Community poultry .
The slaughter of animals is not a priority in the intended measures and the Commission will propose action in line with the different animal welfare standards .
There are still , among the ACP countries , six dictatorships , namely Zimbabwe , Equatorial Guinea , Sudan , Swaziland , Cuba and Eritrea .
It is sometimes a real shame that we should have to take part in votes in our own specialist committees , which can go on for hours , and are thereby prevented from taking part in the exciting and important debates in the ACP @-@ EU committees , which is sometimes - wrongly - taken as an indication of a lack of interest .
We need to get the national parliaments in developing countries empowered with thorough investigative capacities to look at corruption in those administrations .
Corruption is the single biggest obstacle to the delivery of aid to the poor .
In this Parliament we have to be realistic about what we can do .
We are now awaiting a statement from the Commission - that is to say , from Commissioner Kyprianou - and then we can decide how to proceed .
In its resolution , the European Parliament speaks in no uncertain terms of the presidential elections having been manipulated .
Corruption is a by @-@ product of weak governance .
This organisation was formed with a Cold War mentality .
Of course we want to see reforms in Turkey as part of a modernising agenda ; of course we want to see great economic improvements in south @-@ eastern Turkey .
You cannot imagine how hard their lives are .
Furthermore , thousands of these people have been in this situation for more than a year .
( ) Mr President , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that no one may be unlawfully detained and that imprisonment must be in keeping with the letter of the law .
.
I must also inform you that the one @-@ minute speeches on matters of political importance will take place following the oral question to the Council on the modification of the Protocol on privileges and immunities .
With finite resources fast depleting , Europe will have to radically re @-@ examine its patterns of energy supply and consumption .
Those people are forgotten today in our discussions .
We should recognise that Bulgaria and Romania are being subjected to an unparalleled degree of scrutiny .
It is in that area that we believe it to be necessary to monitor those positive developments even beyond the accession date , and we think that , in the unlikely event of those developments not being sustained , there should be financial implications .
It may be difficult for a German social democrat to imagine , but there are such things in Europe as Liberal Prime Ministers - there are , indeed , several of them .
Let me just sum up the view and position of the Commission as regards the accession date and conditions regarding Bulgaria and Romania .
I do not understand how this can be done if the administration is completely excluded .
I hope that the process may be set in motion by the continued use of well @-@ judged language on our side too , and also wish to thank the presidency for its evident efforts at guiding the process down this path .
Mr Kasoulides , Mr Brok and others have said that we should make it very clear to the Palestinian people that it is the European Union that is helping them .
The areas in question are education , training , migration and the protection of the environment , and I believe them to be areas in which further enhanced cooperation will be possible .
We would be much more comfortable talking about a global inter @-@ regional partnership . This is above all because there is no consensus or unanimous view in the region that this free @-@ trade area is as positive an idea as it appears to be .
That , too , is important , for the promotion of civil society in Latin America is one of the European Union &apos;s concerns , and the alternative summit to which you referred will doubtless be a very interesting event , and I hope that it will be well @-@ conducted and peaceful .
We should put in place a uniform system which is the same for Members from all the countries within the European Union .
I would add that this runs counter to the EU &apos;s Natura 2000 programme .
- A6 @-@ 0103 / 2006 by Umberto Guidoni , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the discharge for the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2004 &#91; 2005 / 2117 ( DEC ) &#93; ;
It is indefensible that the Committee of the Regions should not , then , have had a proper internal audit carried out during 2004 , in spite of Parliament &apos;s robust criticism of that institution in relation to 2003 .
We all know that the implementation of this political agreement will require continued work , and the Commission certainly intends to do its utmost in the achievement of that objective .
Thirdly , we need more information .
Proof of that is the situation concerning Parliament &apos;s accounts , as described today by Mr Ferber .
Auditors of the Court found that only five were achieved .
Commissioner Siim Kallas also deserves our thanks for his excellent cooperation with us in all areas , the best proof of which is the fact that he is still available to us at this very late hour for this important debate .
Large amounts of European monies are actually spent and accounted for by Member States , local authorities and external organisations , not the European Institutions - it is this that has left auditors unable to prove that the budget is correct , but equally unable to prove it is not .
At the first sign of trouble , you will see that nobody will feel fully responsible if the monitoring architecture does not specifically establish responsibilities . In this regard , the system of delegation still has a bright future .
That means that we need to work on a sound patent regime , fair competition and free trade in the internal market , and in this connection it is regrettable - I should like to say this once again - that we failed to actually open up the market for services .
While there may still be some inefficiencies in that market , it certainly does not reflect the whole picture .
I could not agree more with Mr Hökmark &apos;s statements .
This will cost about EUR 4.5 billion a year .
However , I am against it .
The cumulative effect of all these measures on the cost of acquiring a motor vehicle could be significant .
Standardisation of the data transmission protocol and signalling are urgently needed to enable the design work and investments to go ahead and , here , commercial interest should not block the work of the standardisation organisations .
Respect for those who speak a minority or regional language is also of fundamental importance to European stability .
For this reason , I would particularly like to emphasise that not only language proficiency , but also the cultures connected with those languages should be promoted on the European level .
In paragraph 77 , the Committee on Foreign Affairs approved an amendment from Mr Fatuzzo relating to pensions .
Hence our vote in favour .
We will resolutely oppose that , not only on behalf of France , but also on behalf of the general interest of Europe .
It is important to give priority to road safety issues and to work to bring about a reduction in the number of fatalities on our roads .
Mr Cohn @-@ Bendit , I am taking the microphone from you because I did not ask you to take the floor .
That principle of a cosmic law has brought us this far and it is my duty to apply our ancestors &quot; rule in order to change our history .
We are extremely worried that the western model of industrialisation is affecting planet Earth , the mother earth : the .
That leads to a legal process lasting 18 years .
We must strongly protest against this attack and show concern about the fate of our fellow lawyers , who are currently rallied in Tunis .
If we want there to be a European law on associations , it is because we want to relax many of the rules and regulations in this area , thereby enabling non @-@ governmental organisations , in particular , to operate more easily across Europe .
Having myself been , for many years , a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I am also pleased that the Commission , in a supplementary statement , has announced a revision of the nutrition labelling directive , which is long overdue .
This law will make SMEs suffer ; it will cost jobs .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate warmly my group colleague , Mrs Poli Bortone , upon reaching this stage of negotiations with what seems like a fruitful result for consumers .
Although it is added in levels that seem small , it accumulates in our bodies over time .
This is why I believe that we should welcome and support the proposal package with its compromises , prepared with long and hard work , even if it is not the ideal solution , as already mentioned by Mrs Sommer and others .
I agree that , alone , it cannot solve the problem of obesity .
The obligation for future national plans to guarantee a 40 % escape rate for eels , something that is practically impossible to calculate , is also removed and replaced by measures that guarantee a high escape rate for adult eel and , to this end , it is requested that account be taken not just of fishing , but of all human activities along rivers that hinder or prevent the return of eel to the sea .
If we could reduce the number of elvers being taken , then we would build up the eel population .
The final distribution of fishing opportunities must be communicated to Parliament , since adjustments are still being made to them at the moment .
I am convinced that these amendments are the guarantee of a coherent and fair agreement .
We do not know of any particular difficulties on the Moroccan side .
I see the declaration as firm proof of Member States , &quot; Parliament &apos;s and the Commission &apos;s firm will to solve the constitutional deadlock .
One can hardly quote him without him claiming the exact opposite in the same speech , and whenever one tries to pin him down he claims to have meant something quite different .
It needs to show that it is ready to move on to an ambitious reform programme that tackles those very issues that I referred to of low growth , high unemployment and threats to our environment .
More and more communication is an essential pre @-@ condition for successful European cooperation .
- Mr President , Vice @-@ President Wallström , ladies and gentlemen , the fundamental question is this : what do the public want from political institutions ?
Secondly , we have been repeating that we want solidarity , prosperity and security , the values that we have set out in our treaties .
The Marco Polo II programme has , then , in essence had an advance green light from all three institutions , and that has prompted us to make the attempt to complete this legislative project as early as first reading and have it ready for use , and it is thanks to a great deal of willingness on the part of the Commission in particular , but also of the Council of Transport Ministers , that we have succeeded in this .
Thirdly , more inland waterway transport projects must be completed than have been in the past , and , fourthly , those national programmes that are either already in place or needed for the future must , at long last , be coordinated .
I am grateful to the Commission for taking that line .
The whole world demands this of us , and we ask that the international community act immediately to support us , in order to prevent the region from sliding into an abyss and a new cycle of conflict that will have a negative impact not just on the Middle East , but on the world as a whole at a time when the region is experiencing other tensions too .
It demonstrates to Europeans , who appear increasingly to doubt the value of our project of European construction , that our continent is making daily progress and producing practical rules to improve their daily lives - in the event , by enabling them to make conscious choices about what they eat . In short , it shows people that Europe is actually of some use .
We voted in favour of the compromise proposals at this second reading , because we feel it is important that there should be a high level of protection for consumers regarding the addition of vitamins , minerals and other substances to foods , which we must ensure do not pose a danger to public health .
I tabled amendments to that end , but , as these amendments have not been adopted , I have voted against the report .
There is one point in the report and the Commission communication with which I do not entirely agree .
I trust that today &apos;s carefully calibrated decision and its rigour will convince the national parliaments that have not yet ratified the Accession Treaty to do so .
It is too easy .
The intention is , no doubt , that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria should complete the reunification of Europe , but both countries must really be ready for accession , and ready for Europe .
It is obvious that Bulgaria and Romania do not fulfil those requirements we chose to set down from the beginning .
There are still shortcomings in some areas , some of them serious ; they have been mentioned here .
The people of both countries strongly supported their governments in this work .
Under the leadership of President Basescu and Prime Minister Popescu @-@ Tariceanu , a determined and serious reform process has begun there , affecting home affairs , the judiciary and the fight against corruption .
If we say that 2007 will be the year , then that would take the pressure off , but if we say that 2008 will be the year , then that would equally take the pressure off , for then people will know that they can join in 2008 come what may and that they can rest on their laurels .
Such concern is altogether commendable .
In other words , there will also be a positive spill @-@ over effect for the Western Balkans .
. The deadline for the transposition of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive into national law is 12 June 2007 , and the new laws must be applicable in the Member States from 12 December 2007 .
I can read you a number of emails that I have received in which people are very concerned .
That is why I am unable to give details of our regulation at the moment , because I have to see everything that is on the table - 150 contributions - and to listen to the national regulators .
In adopting national indicative targets under the Directive , Member States have been somewhat less ambitious , but , overall , the target is a share of about 1.4 % in 2005 .
And the European Union would do well to bear in mind certain official statements from Moscow .
My group considers many parts of this report on the amendment of the Regulation on the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies an extraordinary success .
The Commission argued that this zero tolerance policy could not be implemented , since the technical detection methods for identifying processed animal protein had not previously been sufficiently accurate to take account of the so @-@ called adventitious presence of small amounts of protein from small birds , mammals and rodents accidentally caught in the harvesting process .
Consequently , I , too , welcome the Commission &apos;s proposal to amend EC Regulation No 999 / 2001 laying down rules for the prevention , control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies .
In conclusion I would like to express my conviction that my report and the support that Parliament has shown for it will lead to adequate financing for European standardisation , which will contribute to a simpler and safer life for all European citizens .
As deputy coordinator , I believe that this represents an important step .
. - Madam President , Commissioner , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe welcomes the proposal to appoint Professor Jürgen Stark as a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank .
The write @-@ down in the case of special expenditure on innovation , such as in company accounting , that has been called for by some of my fellow Members , would open the way for further new debt and weaken the European economy dangerously in the long term .
The fact is that the European Union - Europe - is the region of the world , including the less developed parts of the world , that is achieving least growth at a time of international economic expansion .
- Mr President , since my name has been mentioned , I would like , further to Rule 149 ( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure , to simply say that I , too , have been questioned by a television crew , and , before misleading rumours arise , that it is indeed the case that I was using my car early yesterday morning in Kehl , but this is no cause for even more speculation .
Their support and tight cooperation has brought great results .
From the very start of the negotiation process , the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs made four precise demands .
Parliament &apos;s decision to reject the conclusions drawn by the Council in December 2005 at the time established a good basis for further talks .
They make it impossible for the new Member States to catch up with the richer Member States .
In other words , we will have to continue to intensify communication between MEPs and the national parliaments and governments .
The usual practice when a compromise has been reached is to talk about whether the glass is half full or half empty , but that is not the case today , and that is why this so @-@ called compromise will get no support from the Austrian Social Democrats .
The thorny issue of reforming the financing of the budget remains unresolved .
The President of the Palestinian Authority was with us yesterday and I believe that we should remember today that , thanks to your intervention in 1983 , many Palestinians were able to leave Lebanon at a dramatic time , entirely safely , aboard Greek ships which you made available in your capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs .
.Like the French Socialists , I voted against the Böge report , which ratifies the interinstitutional agreement on the 2007 @-@ 2013 financial perspective .
Whilst the proposal adopted by Parliament is the consequence of defining policies and priorities and as such is the true expression of a policy , the Council &apos;s decision , being more of a summary of claims made by the Member States , does not have the same quality .
This is the way to safeguard consumer confidence in the food chain .
Finally , as far as we ourselves are concerned , let me refer to the debate raging this week in my own country , the United Kingdom , on how human rights can be reconciled , given the changed threats of terrorism , people trafficking and organised crime .
I can assure him that he is unlikely to get the kind of shock that other rapporteurs have received the night before or on the day of the vote on the human rights report .
The European Parliament must take on the responsibility for raising the importance of human rights protection in the European Union .
The EU has not always managed to do that , although of course it has sometimes .
The debate is closed .
We have said so on several occasions .
.
I was shadow rapporteur on behalf of the ALDE Group when the ENPI Regulation was being discussed and I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Szymański , for his cooperation .
As in the case of the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation instrument ( DCECI ) , this instrument is subject to the codecision procedure but has no political content .
Today &apos;s message is that the European Parliament has established the objective of considerably increasing its right of participation in the issues mentioned .
Whoever in the Commission thought this up ?
It is not the number of regulations but the content of the regulations that makes codecision possible .
I beg your indulgence and a little more patience .
- These questions concern a uniform assessment basis for company taxation .
But would the President @-@ in @-@ Office share my concerns that growth rates do not appear to be converting into forecasted increases in employment rates ?
Moving on to Parliament &apos;s involvement , Article 4 ( 5 ) of the proposal for a Council decision stipulates - as proposed by the Commission - that Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed of any decision of the Council on the establishment of Community positions to be taken in the three bodies of the Energy Community Treaty .
. - Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my group supports the present Treaty , but we should like to emphasise a number of points that have already been raised , in order to qualify our assent with some reservations .
I really believe that Turkey is close to joining the Community .
Linked to the ODA level is aid effectiveness and quality .
Although the EU Constitutional Treaty was rejected , the Commission and the Council may start to develop a common foreign affairs administration for the Union .
Faster , leaner , more efficient - those were the points we made with regard to the procedures , to enable profitable , value @-@ added investment of European funds .
What do I wish to emphasise in particular in my speech today ?
The championing of Lisbon over Gothenburg and of some elements of Lisbon over others in the Commission &apos;s original guidelines is worrying .
Mr President , I would like to thank the Committees on Regional Development , the Environment and Agriculture and the respective rapporteurs , Mr Galeote Quecedo , Mr Berend , Mr Capoualas Santos and Mrs Estrela , for their hard and constructive work .
Climate change lies at the root of the natural disasters - be they floods , extreme droughts or fires - that have been occurring with increasing frequency throughout the world and have caused terrible damage in terms of human loss , environmental deterioration and reduced economic activity .
We have a huge amount of work facing us .
Our solidarity should not be confined to our borders .
There is an insistence on a partisan and self @-@ interested approach to dealing with disasters and the pain they cause for so many people , in my region , Castilla @-@ La Mancha , for example .
The next item is the vote .
Human rights cannot be relinquished , and no price can be put on them .
We Swedish Social Democrats are opposed to new instruments and more funding for the agricultural sector .
Above all , the amount of money spent on funding to ensure that this observatory could operate would be cut from the crucial aid for activities on the ground .
. - Ladies and gentlemen , southern Asia has long suffered from instability in a number of countries in the region .
I want it to reinstate the Human Rights Commission .
Let us not forget that Taiwan is the only one of the four large Chinese societies in Asia to have both democracy and respect for human rights .
The debate is closed .
It is doing just fine , without a project , without a constitution .
In short , only when we develop common instruments , such as a European army and European diplomacy , will we be forced to lay our cards on the table - and in due time - in the event of an international crisis .
We should also particularly like to thank Estonia for having ratified the constitution a few days ago .
I have a great deal to say about some of the ideas put forward by Mr Verhofstadt .
History teaches us that , when we were divided and inward @-@ looking , Europe was in crisis , a war was being fought , civil wars were constantly being fought .
In receiving the International Charlemagne Prize of the city of Aachen , an award on which I should like to congratulate him , Dr Juncker rightly pointed out that Europe would founder if , in the next few years , it did not succeed in becoming a social Europe , for example through having a basic minimum of employees &quot; rights , valid throughout Europe .
A demos has a common political arena in which debate can take place and where conflicts can be analysed and resolved by democratic means .
We shall only overcome these challenges if we succeed in transforming today &apos;s Europe , which is too tied up in bureaucracy , into a Europe of the people , of policies and of values .
I shall begin with the question of Declaration 30 because this Declaration has quite a strange history .
The Commission underlines that all anti @-@ terrorist measures must be consistent with both international humanitarian law and international human rights law .
Moreover , the fact that great efforts are taking place within the United States , together with a debate designed to put an end to torture and the like is shown by , for example , the initiatives taken by Senator McCain .
In order to bring such an arrangement into operation , the European Parliament should , as a first step , set up an early warning system in Washington , with a reciprocal arrangement also put in place , in order in this way to have our sights set on legislation at an early stage .
The third issue I wanted to tackle is China .
In the coming weeks , the temporary committee of inquiry into alleged CIA camps will be discussing its draft interim report .
A transatlantic market without barriers is a feasible objective ; it just needs to be based on a new and unified regulatory architecture .
Are all the barriers to the transatlantic market undesirable ?
German domination of Europe is fortunately a thing of the past , so please , Mr Schulz , remember this once and for all , and keep your German aspirations well clear of Poland &apos;s internal affairs .
Aid for trade is an essential complement , but in no way a substitute , for a development @-@ friendly outcome in the main negotiating areas of the DDA .
By adopting this measure as it stands , we would stand the risk of depriving ourselves of medicinal products which , when this law entered into force , happened to be in this two @-@ year period .
I would like to express my regret that due to lack of support during the vote in May , no amendments were adopted to prevent abuse of the system of remuneration and incentives that are permissible under the provisions of the regulation under discussion .
Or that hot topic , MP3 , a German invention , although 90 % of sales are now made outwith the EU .
In the end , I feel that the report we have developed and refined is a good one which will have the support of the vast majority of my colleagues here and which in turn emphatically endorses the Commissioner &apos;s stance .
At the same time it passes over the fact that when the euro was introduced , many old Member States did not meet these criteria .
Last year we decided by a clear majority that we would add EUR five million for groups of visitors .
I would emphasise , with the support of my colleagues , the importance of this aspect of intercultural dialogue in the broader sense .
This is a crucial element .
I need hardly stress that this assumption is far removed from any current and future reality .
Such a step could lead to greater economic efficiency , generate a trend towards more jobs and help make European industry more competitive , all of which are in line with the aims of the Lisbon Strategy .
.
If forced to choose between working and having a family , an increasing number of women choose to work .
The report mentions resolving a major problem , which is the situation of Roma women .
It is the self @-@ identity of the European Union that will determine whether we will be able to move forward in the direction mapped by the report .
These include peace negotiations , peacekeeping operations , demobilisation , disarmament , reintegration and rehabilitation .
How would you feel if you were the captain of a ship and you have a navigating officer joining you who is a lieutenant commander and a female ?
Any postponement , therefore , however reluctant , would be interpreted as a sign of hesitation on a subject on which we have to be extremely clear .
In addition , accepting that amendment might encourage research into paediatric indications for medicines produced for adult use , precisely going against one of the aims of the regulation .
We need to be firm with the PA government , but open to President Mahmood Abbas and his initiatives in search of a general agreement on the only acceptable solution , which is the peaceful coexistence of two States .
It is revolting that the Commission makes a strategic decision , and for the first time it sanctions somebody in the interest of the enlargement of the euro zone .
Instead of spending large sums of money on direct aid , it may be better to invigorate poor countries through economic cooperation , including trade and the exchange of goods , services and skills , so that they can build their own prosperity .
Is that so or is it not ?
Today , our most important task is to guarantee that events like those that took place sixty years ago will never happen again .
Mr President , I should like to ask you bring this matter to the attention of the Commission , and request that before the summer recess a statement be made in relation to the implementation of forest fire prevention measures in the Member States .
I think that we should avoid getting into a discussion about the relative merits of petitions and complaints procedures .
Furthermore , from my involvement in that debate , I was able to see the Committee on Petitions operating efficiently to ensure that the work of our Parliament contributed to things being done properly .
We have also given our support to setting up two multilingual telephone helplines , already operational , that have been entrusted to two German NGOs that are well @-@ known in Germany .
It is sometimes calls from people like them , rather than politicians , that can achieve a lot more , provided some of them grow into the role one would wish for them .
This will not do .
In just a few hours in the small town of Pärnu , Estonia , we gathered hundreds of signatures against forced prostitution .
Firstly , it lays down clear criteria for evaluating the good chemical status of groundwater and for identifying and reversing trends in the deterioration of the quality of groundwater .
We know that certain Member States achieve excellent results because they over @-@ adjust their measurements .
But there is another issue that we should take seriously .
Thus pollution is in this case also a straightforward economic mistake .
Allow me to give you a few examples .
These amendments are acceptable in full , with the exception of Amendment 21 , which is acceptable in principle .
During our visit to Germany and Austria we listened to the people &apos;s concerns , gathered suggestions from the regional authorities and observed examples of good practice in flood risk prevention and management .
Appreciative though I am of the Commission proposal , I do have two comments to make about it .
If you observed people &apos;s responses to flooding in our area , you might think that the inhabitants of the Moselle area had mastered flood management , that they had , as it were , become well practised in the art .
In a market economy , public institutions are not expected to plan the economy , organise investment or manage economic structures .
We realise , however , that little progress has been made .
Getting FP7 started in time will require an increased effort from all of us .
1 ) to use embryonic stem cells to treat such incurable diseases as diabetes , Parkinson &apos;s disease , infarcted myocardium , etc . This would help prevent premature death in adults , but the embryo itself would die ,
Important European and US daily newspapers recently said that , in Europe , new investments were being made in computer and technology companies , precisely because there was more flexibility in that field .
The Commission proposed appropriations amounting to EUR 72 billion , then the governments reduced the European effort to EUR 50 billion .
It is foolish for us to continue with the distorted policy that has gone on for decades whereby we allocate more funds to research into nuclear energy via Euratom than the total for EU funds for other areas of energy research .
Furthermore , through this work , our Parliament is confirming its commitment to the Lisbon Strategy , and important steps are being taken towards the achievement of the two great objectives set for 2010 to create the European Research Area and to achieve an overall spending on R + D of 3 % of GDP , with just a third coming from the public sector and the remaining two @-@ thirds from the private sector .
I accept that the ethical issues are a very difficult area : embryonic stem cell research , somatic nuclear cell transfer technology and genetic therapies for hereditary diseases .
We all know how important it is to make progress in the energy field , and I would emphasise once more how important it is for the large energy companies , whose large profits are chiefly a result of increases in oil and gas prices , to invest more in research .
It is one of the most important building blocks that will allow us to compete at world level and it is an answer to globalisation .
The third issue is fundamental research and the independence of the scientists conducting this research .
Researchers must be able to use stem cells in the context of fundamental and applied research .
I therefore welcome this report in so far as it endorses risk @-@ based approaches to the problem of deterioration .
I firmly believe that the commencement of the 4th Meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee will signal a new and important period of ever closer cooperation between the two sides , which recognise the same democratic values and share a common approach to the principles of the rule of law .
I have written to President Borrell on this matter , and he has replied to assure me that the services will be looking into this , and this was followed by a deafening silence .
The paranoia of an avian flu pandemic has drawn vital resources from other health areas and has largely benefited the pharmaceutical industry and the media .
We still lack data and will therefore be investing in this .
My colleague , Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner , in her bilateral contacts with the Tunisian authorities , including her latest visit to Tunisia in October 2005 , has systematically pointed to the importance of respecting human rights and developing a free , open and participative civil society .
What we want now - and several of us have said so - is action , that is to say practical decisions by the Council and the Commission regarding Tunisia on account of the incessant human rights violations of which the country is guilty .
For both the EU and Russia , Russia &apos;s WTO accession remains a key priority .
In this connection , then , we hopefully awoke to the fact that these problems of transit are serious and stability is also needed in transit countries , and not just in Russia , when it comes to gas supplies .
The judiciary , like in many former Soviet countries , still lacks the degree of independence seen in the EU and tends to bend to political pressure .
Therefore , it is very important that our energy policy and the external aspects of Europe &apos;s common energy policy are very high on the agenda of the Finnish Presidency and , I trust , of all the future presidencies .
The question the honourable Member asked regarding codecision is a matter for the Treaties .
However , another type of practice aimed at curbing parallel trade such as &apos; dual pricing systems &quot; - which , as you know , are systems where prices differ according to whether the product is for local consumption or for export to the other Member States - has been held to infringe Article 81 in , for example , the Glaxo @-@ Wellcome decision of May 2001 .
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for that comprehensive reply .
Respect for human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law underpins the Cotonou Partnership signed by the ACP States and the Community and its Member States .
I would also like to have seen greater account taken of the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , which has been considering this matter with us .
Yes , the Council was defeated that day by a further judicial show of strength .
To that one must add the Commission communication on interoperability and synergy and enhancing the efficiency of European databases , the effect of which in practice will be to connect these databases with one another , so that - once the technical problems have been overcome - the exchange of data will be made much simpler .
In Sweden , we have a good deal of crime that is committed by people from across the Baltic Sea .
Ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to congratulate and thank the rapporteur for the report that has been presented .
We also ask Member States to take on obligations , without any reservations or restrictive declarations , under human rights treaties in the field of non @-@ discrimination and the protection of persons belonging to minorities , as well as to honour such obligations in good faith .
We have legislation which already covers the vast majority of groups within the European Union .
The Commission ought to take action against states , which are unable to implement EU anti @-@ discrimination legislation .
Secondly , this approach has involved reviving the continuous debate on the future of Europe .
I should like to make it perfectly clear : we , at the European Commission , are in favour of the principles , the values and the substance of the Constitutional Treaty .
This declaration is necessary because other public statements have occasionally given the impression that the Member States concerned are distancing themselves from their commitments , and that would be a real crisis of confidence and a breakdown in loyalty among the Member States .
If the Council Presidency takes that into account at the Summit , my praise for the success of this Presidency will be even greater .
.
In the past , we have asked the Commission to make an extra effort in order to help Romania and Bulgaria in their preparations , and to be clear about what they expect of the candidate countries .
Mr Blair constantly preached the virtues of more openness during his Presidency and we got a specific agreement that we would get openness in relation to Council meetings and Council processes .
Finally , I would like to say that you have not said anything about the Regulation on the Funds .
Finally , when it comes to catching up , some are travelling in a high @-@ speed elevator to the designated floor , while others have to struggle on the stairs .
Thirdly , to ensure that the appointment of the President of the Commission is made by taking into account the votes cast by Europeans during the European elections .
They deserve it and Europe needs them .
Mr President , we are talking about the period of reflection and debate on the future of Europe , but given what we are discussing this morning , I believe that this a debate on the present of the European Union .
Europe needs to enhance its credibility and face up to the problems as best it can ; this will then provide the basis for supporting the Constitution and defending it to the citizens .
The main priority is the constitutional issue , which the conclusions document also omits , but which was the central - and virtually the only - theme of the speech given by the President of the Commission .
They generate more profit for the traffickers and also do more harm to the health of those who take them .
- The report is in keeping with the ruling by the Court and the relevant Commission communication .
Another wearisome debate dominated by the slow @-@ learning fanatics of a failed and rejected Constitution .
The next item is the debate on the following :
Work is natural capital , the capital produced by people .
Furthermore , it ignores problems such as the relationship between the economy and sustainable development .
This means that in financial respects too we must ensure that sufficient means are available .
Sustainable development is anchored in the treaties ; it is an overarching objective for all European policies .
By coming together , our countries decided to uphold and to promote these values .
We protest against the lies and hypocrisy of the left .
It is also , on account of its plea in favour of further curbing the free expression of opinion , worryingly undemocratic .
It goes to show that there are very unpleasant and dangerous trends directed against homosexuals among the peoples of Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is set to play a central role in the UN conference aimed at looking into the issue of small arms and light weapons , although it will not take part in the talks on the formal documents .
I believe , Mr Mölzer , that we are doing that .
On the other hand , these people could become our trading partners .
If I may turn to the jobs issue , what , according to the estimates , is going to happen if greater reliance is placed on alternative forms of energy ?
Nevertheless , given the environmental protection responsibility and Parliament &apos;s resolutions on natural disasters and the regional , environmental and agricultural scale thereof , describing in detail the tragedy most keenly felt in Mediterranean Europe , especially last year in Spain and in my country Portugal , which were attributable to the continued destruction of vast forest areas , and which led to a heavy cost in terms of human sustainability , of the depopulation of rural areas , of the growth and development of these areas , I should like to ask you , Mr Pröll , if there are any more ...
Precisely because the security funding situation in Europe is highly varied at the moment , it is important to ensure that the issue is made explicit , that the citizens understand what they are contributing towards , and that the funds intended for security be used transparently and effectively .
That is in any case more transparent than confrontation between different nations &quot; highly divergent ways of dealing with this , which may - and I deliberately say &apos; may , &quot; although many are probably aware of what I am talking about - be capable of being misused to distort competition or exclude certain practices .
Several of you have referred to the first of these , namely the funding issue .
It is essential to ensure that ERTMS is put in place wherever it is compulsory , especially on all the new high @-@ speed lines .
Most recently , by means of Marco Polo I and II , we made a direct attempt at supporting more environmentally @-@ friendly modes of transport , and now , with NAIADES , we are attempting to create new opportunities for internal shipping .
It is dependent on resolving the economic aspects that influence operating costs .
It is a vitally important network of mostly small , mostly family @-@ run businesses , which are the lifeblood of most of our small coastal communities .
The appeal for action is thus entirely justified .
Despite the positive outcome , I should like to mention a few points .
In other words , the Commission is practically blind in this affair , and so we must take precautionary steps .
He used the extremely efficient method of naming and shaming , and quite rightly so .
This report is a sad catalogue of failure - failure to direct enormous amounts of EU funds to where they were intended .
In other words , 12 does not lapse , but 91 is adopted or not adopted , and then we vote on 12 .
Already in the current Sixth Framework Programme , six projects are being funded , in contravention of promises made to the European Parliament , which do not comply with German legislation .
Anyone who has lived with relatives who suffer from debilitating and chronic conditions hopes for progress in treatment .
The real prerequisites for the genuinely sustainable development of our nations are the reinstatement of our borders and a major policy on the family .
&quot; Member States should consider whether their police forces and judicial systems suffer from &apos; institutional racism .... &quot; &quot;
However , the legislation of other wine @-@ producing countries , in particular the United States , Chile and South Africa , does not provide for such a ban .
As a wine @-@ grower myself , I may not necessarily agree with everything he has written , but often in politics we say things we do not always mean .
In particular , we must support the action being taken by President Xanana Gusmão and Minister Ramos Horta on behalf of the government .
What lessons emerge from this for the donor countries ?

The North Korean Government consistently refuses to allow access to the country for United Nations observers or for non @-@ governmental organisations working in defence of human rights .
The third topic was the improvement of protection for European citizens when abroad and how to make consular cooperation more efficient .
Last week here in the European Parliament we discussed how this European Council offered a real opportunity .
I could scarcely believe it when I saw the press conference on TV when you said that they had all declared their support for the substance of this constitution .
I find this lack of action arrogant and it will not be accepted by many citizens .
What we still do not know , though , is what Europe can do to really solve its problems .
Nowhere is this contempt for democracy better illustrated than by the actions of the Austrian Presidency .
On the eve of the World Cup I handed over the final list of signatures to the anti @-@ trafficking campaign to Commissioner Frattini .
In fact , I think that we can do more and that we should have the confidence to do more .
The final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 29 June 2006 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed .
How does this fit in with respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights , for instance , which states in Article 1 that &apos; Human dignity is inviolable .
Mr President , it gives me pleasure to present our interim report and I would like to thank our secretariat , the Chairman of our committee and the members for their support and work .
It appears that both customers and authorities in Ireland and Germany were taken by surprise when the crisis broke out .
Thousands of investors have lost money because of the cost of over @-@ bonusing &apos; with @-@ profit &quot; life assurance policies .
There is another point related to this . Countries &apos; economies , especially those in transition or in the process of developing , are not simply a cow which is there to be milked .
Secondly , what does a pluralist banking structure mean in the European Union ?
Rather , we must identify the European Union &apos;s general interests , assess the impact of the operations announced on those interests , consider the consequences of the operations from political , legislative and economic points of view and , of course , seek the best necessary response , bearing in mind that the financial policy and the stock market policy have a significant impact on the European Union &apos;s monetary policy .
Some people want to get involved in the European way .
As a member of this Parliament &apos;s Committee on Transport , I would nevertheless like to express a few regrets , stressing one point in particular .
There are completely different ways of channelling funds to terrorists .
We know that the donation system is being abused to finance terrorism .
However , opinions were split on the details of the measures proposed for the medium and long term .
I hope that Mr Lehne will revisit this issue - even though he does not seem to be listening at the moment - to see if he can support those .
We keep hearing this in debates on climate : that the individual emitter is only ever responsible for a proportion of the emissions .
We should , though , pull out all the stops to ensure that this trend is bucked .
Interestingly , a recent House of Lords report on aviation &apos;s contribution to climate change stated that it was insignificant and likely to remain so for 30 years .
Mr President , I thank the Members of Parliament for their very important speeches and for their contribution to this evening &apos;s debate .
Well , Aarhus translates our words into action .
We do not agree that cordless power tools , specifically , should be excepted . They account for a large proportion of the cadmium batteries in use today .
Guernica and the Condor Legion are and remain a blot on my country &apos;s history .
In Eastern Europe , a dam against Communism was created by the victorious battle of the Poles against the Bolsheviks in 1920 and the decisive resistance of Catholic Poland against enforced Soviet dominance .
When it comes to values , I am among those who believe that the free functioning of the market alone will never be able to promote the essence of the European project , of which I am a staunch advocate , which is based on the values of peace , social justice , freedom , democracy and respect for human rights .
Let me use this opportunity to express my personal thanks to the rapporteurs , Mr Hatzidakis , Mr Andria , Mr Silva Peneda , Mr Fava and Mr Olbrycht , and to say how much we appreciated the role Mrs Krehl played as rapporteur for the Financial Perspective and her work on the Community Strategic Guidelines .
They must be integrated , they must feel that we are there for them .
Ladies and gentlemen , the only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the Council has shown far greater solidarity than Parliament as regards the negotiations on the structural funds .
Mr President , today represents the end of a good piece of work by this Parliament , a good piece of work by the Commission and a rather less good piece of work by the Council , in particular a number of Member States within it - sadly , my own among them .
They help dispel prejudices which have been causing ethnic and minority problems for a long time .
A third issue worth mentioning is the environment , sustainable development and security .
The international community took a major step forward with the adoption of the United Nations Convention Against Organised Crime , ratified by 121 countries , plus the European Community , which is the first legally binding global instrument designed to combat criminal networks .
These funds should only go to the very poorest parts of Europe .
What the euro did not do and what the Constitution failed to do , because the nations woke up to what was happening , taxation is set to do between 2014 and 2019 .
Such regions would have been seriously harmed had the new aviation charges been applied uniformly across the European area .
I criticise those who pay themselves huge salaries but are not worth a penny as responsible managers , because they have driven their company to the wall and squandered the jobs it once provided .
It has a lot to do with European leadership , about explaining the challenges we are facing and about doing what we can to facilitate the journey into the future by preparing individuals and businesses ; but not about making false promises , protecting jobs and hoping for short @-@ term political gains .
Mr President , it is no coincidence that my colleague , Mr Bushill @-@ Matthews , and myself have asked to speak in this debate .
Businesses receive Community and State aid and incentives to set up in a given region and country , and then relocate , flying in the face of the rules of conduct in place , without any compunction or respect for the hundreds or thousands of workers , and often whole families , who are laid off at the drop of a hat .
Only a real single market will give us better opportunities for growth and employment .
The most recent data show that we still lag behind both the United States and Japan , and as for the new competitors , they are catching up with us , as was mentioned a moment ago .
A basic precondition for establishing the framework for a conducive business environment is the availability of sufficient funding from the EU budget .
We are talking about competition based on R + D , on innovation , quality and design , on infrastructures , on new ways of organising production and on investment in pioneering sectors .
The issue in this case is that I have a constituent who has disability problems ; he watches television and wants to watch just one subscription channel .
However , as required by Regulation ( EC ) No 1 / 2003 , the Commission publishes all its decisions in due course .
As I said in my question and as you have commented , many thousands of ordinary Iraqis out of the sight of the media are kidnapped every day .
In my own view , the best way to show the public how important it is to abolish powers of veto is to give them concrete examples .
- Madam President , I should like to ask the Commissioner to organise evening classes for the honourable Members on what comes within the jurisdiction of the Member States and what comes within the jurisdiction of the Commission , so that the honourable Members do not have to keep asking the Commission to act as guardian on national matters .
In fact , in my own country - the smallest in the European Union - the relative percentages are even higher .
. Mr President , as the rapporteur said in her introductory remarks , a happy outcome is worth waiting for , and she was not wrong in that .
On that basis , the analysis period can actually be reduced to two years , Mr Stockmann , as Parliament is proposing .
Pilots &quot; working conditions have been quite carefully examined in the past , and competition must not be allowed to cause a deterioration of those conditions .
The Commission may well be encumbered by the sort of thinking that proposes that the free movement of goods , written into the Treaty , should also apply to spent fuel for disposal .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , France stirred up a wave of indignation when it classified the shipment of radioactive waste as an official secret .
We cannot just think about the here and now , or future elections ; we have to think about the interests of future generations .
Coordination of civil and military crisis management will continue .
We must promote effective mechanisms - like venture capital - to finance innovation by European companies , having in mind also small and medium @-@ sized companies .
I would ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council to take a more serious approach to addressing this issue , not least at Council level , for when democracy is threatened , it is most often from within rather than from without .
.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have already said on other occasions that , until we change our liberalist approach , we will struggle to get out of the crisis that Europe is in .
I criticise you for clinging onto the rejected European constitution .
Mr President , the President @-@ in @-@ Office is famous in Finland for cooperation and consensus .
Parliament &apos;s proposal and the proposal by the Commission and the Council make no mention of agencies that supply temporary workers .
We have an economy whose individual strands are becoming ever more closely interwoven .
It must be business @-@ based , and should clearly work both ways and give the same rights to all concerned parties .
Therefore , I greatly applaud the Finnish Presidency &apos;s ambition to bring about an EU which supports cooperation within its institutions and communicates more effectively with its citizens .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a real humanitarian disaster has been taking place in Gaza over the last few hours , involving more than one million civilians .
If the voices of reason are speaking out in Israel to condemn these crimes , why is the Council struck down dumb ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I can only share the profound concern which Members of Parliament have expressed on the worsening crisis in the Middle East .
. The purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the effectiveness of contacts between law @-@ enforcement authorities and to maintain law and order in the different Member States in order to improve the planning of cross @-@ border policing during certain international events .
I should like to highlight the current lack of investment in R &#91; amp &#93; D , the lack of promotion of entrepreneurship with the emphasis on innovation and the lack of political and financial support for lifelong learning and ICT training .
I acknowledge and agree that the European Parliament temporary committee does not claim to be a sort of &apos; European super @-@ court &quot; and this is a very important factor in identifying institutional responsibilities .
.
We should remember that the terrorists do not recognise any rights , treaties or conventions .
We cannot pretend that in protecting human rights , we never use them as an ideological tool of anti @-@ Americanism .
Either way , it is clear that security forces in some Member States are working outside the reach of proper and effective governmental control and scrutiny .
I firmly believe , Mr President , that Parliament should take the opportunity to amend the report to ensure that our work is credible .
Mrs Ludford has touched on the theme of the implementation of anti @-@ terrorism legislation by Member States , a central issue on which we certainly need to work .
It is a matter that should be seen in a wider context , referring to PNR , to the control of communications and to data retention , and this subject is not unconnected with the topic of rendition that we were addressing just a few minutes ago .
What plans does the Finnish Presidency nonetheless have to advance the search for more effective , democratic and transparent decision @-@ making in this area ?
We would also need to respect the concerned country &apos;s right to self @-@ determination .
Now the technical work is being done .

The problem is not procedural , it is deeply political .
However , with this agreement we can say no to any implementing measures we dislike , even every single one of them , if we are dealing with quasi @-@ legislative measures .

Our European migration policy must aim to manage legal migration while also preventing the illegal variety , for space for legal migrants is made available only if the illegal ones are kept at bay .
On average , traffickers ask these desperate people for enormous sums , between USD 1.500 and 2.500 each , without even providing a guarantee of safe arrival on the other side of the Mediterranean .
The project to create so @-@ called &apos; regional protection &quot; areas in countries such as Belarus is also in keeping with this idea .
So many people are dying that it is not possible to give an accurate figure .
Yes , the Maltese people are right to see these as empty words , because they are saying : where is the solidarity we talk about so much ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we must go further in our fight against HIV / AIDS , in order to be able to provide preventative measures and treatment to all those who need them by 2010 .
Therefore , if we had a common programme , we could then perhaps implement a more refined strategy that would engage in a more direct way with the specific aspects - and even local aspects - of this problem .
Thus , I would like to stress that , in my opinion , it is very important to introduce a clear and as simple as possible procedure for recognising qualifications .
If , within the framework of the WTO , we cannot agree to the free movement of goods , it seems that agreeing to the free movement of people is an even more difficult task , although these two issues are worlds apart .
The time has come to build a variety of information centres , foreign aid centres and legal aid centres .
It is undoubtedly a very popular trade practice .
In our global marketplace , the use of internationally recognised labels or marks , which conscientious consumers can have confidence in , is a logical and significant contribution to economic and social improvements across the globe .
Let us please help these countries eradicate the source of this threat .
However , there are five important agreements that were reached during the negotiations which are not reflected in the amendments in front of you , but which nevertheless form an integral part of the compromise achieved .
By giving &apos; economic aid &apos; to third countries , the European Union is acquiring the right to intervene in them , on the pretext of addressing situations of destabilisation , &apos; crisis &apos; and &apos; unfolding crisis &apos; , situations which constitute &apos; threats &apos; to the rule of law , law and order and the protection of human rights and to the promotion of the principles of international law , including support for special national and international criminal courts .
The considerations , concerns and proposals contained in this resolution are worthy of my support .
.
One element of this is to organise the repatriation of immigrants to their countries of origin , so that those countries can benefit from the experience and the skills they gained during their stay in the European Union .
The crisis within the WTO makes it more likely that the institution will no longer be able to act as anything more than an arbitrator and will no longer be able to take the initiative in proposing new rules , with the consequent threat of world trade being once more in thrall to innumerable bilateral agreements .
Thirdly , not even in the next few weeks must there be any premature political deals .
That might help considerably .
I would point out that the Committee on International Trade has withdrawn its motion for a resolution B6 @-@ 0381 / 2006 .
After 11 September 2001 , the United States added Sheikh Aweys to the black list of international terrorists .
This joint motion for a resolution aims primarily to offer support to the people of Mauritania in their difficult and eagerly awaited transition to democracy , in the hope that this worthy goal will be achieved amicably , peacefully and within the expected time parameters previously agreed with all the parties concerned .
The fact is , we are not all equal when it comes to freedom of expression on the Internet , and some States have begun to ban citizens , journalists and others from expressing themselves .
That is worth remembering at a time when the main theme in society often seems to be worthlessness .
By agreeing to this coalition , Mr Fico has left the door open to such outbursts , and there is a fine line between words and actions .
This cooperation is unconditional , as the governments of these two countries are also working together .
I urge this House to stress to the Commission and the Council that , while we may be counting beans in terms of budgets , they are dealing with people and families and their actions are having a very severe impact on them .
Finally , the Commissioner said something about the Council and mixed reactions .
Madam President , the passenger car is universally used throughout the European Union .
I have to say that my country , Denmark , does not support the Commission &apos;s proposal .
Moving a car from one Member State to another entails considerable obstacles , which are still due to different tax laws and inflexible administrative legal practices .
They must be excluded from the provisions of this directive and I personally will support any amendments to this end .

- Mr President , Commissioner , unfortunately the ecological disasters caused by accidents at sea continue to constitute a serious danger to the seas and coastal areas of Europe , while the ability of the Member States to deal with these accidents is often inadequate .
We have established a warning system that is effective , but insufficient .
- Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is sad to realise that only in recent years has the subject of civil protection been aired in this Chamber and it is debated each time in connection with a particular kind of disaster : an earthquake the day before yesterday , marine pollution yesterday , fires and floods today , and so forth .
However , that is not enough .
The rules governing this instrument allow for the possibility of assistance in the event of major natural disasters .
Will the new elected leaders of DRC be able to put a stop to this violence ?
I could show you more than ten interviews I have given to European or Congolese newspapers that express my perfect neutrality .
The debate is closed .
The stability of the global trade system calls , in my opinion , for new dynamic impetus to the link between commercial interdependence and joint responsibility between the European Union and the United States of America and this link between interdependence and joint responsibility must be verified .
It is time to exclude agriculture from the talks once and for all and not sell out European farmers .
If the differences between states are constantly on the increase - and you , Commissioner , said as much - then why are we thinking in such categories as &apos; multilateral &quot; or &apos; bilateral &quot; ?
- Mr President , I wish to say straight from the outset that I agree absolutely with Commissioner Mandelson &apos;s approach and the considerations he expressed .
We continue to demand a European Year against violence against women ; it is something that has been being called for for a long time , not least in Daphne I and II , and we are being persistent and consistent in continuing to do so .
The vast amount of knowledge gathered to date correlates poorly with the primary environmental factors influencing the development of a well @-@ balanced personality .
Unless we are able to apply our legal tools and use the support of politicians to stop the abuse of minors , we will never win the battle against violence against women and children .
The Spanish Government has implemented a law against gender violence , with a clear commitment to combat this social scourge .
I would like to point out that in 2000 you took on the joint presidency of the Millennium Summit and that you subsequently chaired the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation , something which is now highly topical - the social dimension of globalisation - something which is having an increasingly significant impact on Europe .
The EU had a central role in establishing the road map , and now too the Union must show initiative in promoting a comprehensive plan for peace .
. Although respect for the official languages of all Member States is enshrined in the Treaties , repeated attempts have been made to restrict the number of working languages in the EU , with bias always shown towards the languages of the countries with largest populations .
.
Many of the measures in the report can be supported , but we are opposed to passing new and additional powers to the European Commission and other European institutions when the same objectives can be achieved at national level .
The Council , however , stated that agricultural expenditure and expenditure relating to international fishing agreements should be re @-@ examined in the autumn on the basis of the Commission &apos;s revised communication .
That means that the Commission will not be able to recruit anyone at all .
Europe must reform its policies if it wants to protect its values .
In this way , the rapporteurs of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament are seeking to continue the policy of pandering to Europe &apos;s captains of industry and the interests of the large economic and financial groups , opening up new business areas and placing a significant proportion of pension system funding in the hands of private profit .
Similarly , we did not think a few years ago , ten years ago when we signed the world trade agreement , that our products are encumbered by the cost of welfare , while the products produced by the Indians and Chinese , who account for half the planet &apos;s workforce , have no such cost .
It would be against our values and vain to seek the lowest labour costs , the most docile employees , the weakest taxes , and the most lax environmental , social , health and welfare standards of our competitors .
The upheavals in France showed us that even the greatest wealth cannot protect you in the midst of a raging crowd .
Now that we can see the ministers on television I look forward to seeing the embarrassment as you point your finger at them , Minister , one by one , and ask them for an explanation as to why those plans have not been submitted .
The electricity price rose , not only because of the emissions trading system , but mainly because of high fuel prices and because of the lack of competition in the power and gas market - a lack of liberalisation .
However , we place great importance on Parliament &apos;s view that classifying tobacco smoke as a carcinogen would be advisable .
The main goal of the policy I defend is to provide people with good @-@ quality jobs , and enough of them .
. I know that there is doubt about the data submitted to us by the Maltese authorities , but even with these data , we have concluded that there is no reason for a derogation from the ban on spring hunting and we have started infringement procedures against Malta .
If their position has indeed been stated , what are the details , and what is the Commission &apos;s response ?
- The next item is the oral question to the Commission by Thierry Cornillet , on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , on the counterfeiting of medicinal products ( O @-@ 0039 / 2006 - B60310 / 2006 ) .
The Commissioner claimed that an international convention or standard is not enough , but I can well imagine that one could make a difference , and if it proves inadequate , then more should be done .
We also need to look at concepts as yet unmentioned , such as hope and fear , creativity and expression , faith and spirituality .
The effort to improve the economy and prosperity of our regions has brought about a change in working conditions .
Women are more likely to seek healthcare , and to take more pharmaceutical products , which they are less able to tolerate .
This is the challenge of our age and we have to meet this challenge .
Today , with this report , we are opening a new chapter , and it is to be hoped that it will soon be enlarged upon in a White Paper .
Exactly what legal form to choose in order to best achieve that aim is a key issue , which will need careful consideration .
To what extent are we maintaining more than just superficial contact with government bodies ?
I call on Parliament to correct this budgetary dead @-@ end .
- Mr President , three minutes is a wonderfully long time .
One main reason for why standards have not been achieved , despite the massive input that there has been , is that Kosovo is one of the main havens for organised crime in Europe .
It is important that we start to make effective use of the Interim Agreement once it has entered into force .
The political forces on all sides should also , and once and for all , stop constantly crying out for an international mediator to sort their problems out .
In October 2002 , the Commission said association negotiations should not commence .
I would like to thank Mr Toomas Hendrik Ilves for his thorough and detailed report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I am very glad that there is strong and broad commitment within all the Union &apos;s institutions , including Parliament , to the Western Balkans &quot; European perspective .
The report correctly points out that there is no genuine European social model , and yet , significantly , it describes a series of values that we jointly recognise and sets out the problems that each country must resolve in its social policy .
.
For all of us in the Council , it has always been clear that there cannot be any sustainable stability and peace in Lebanon , or elsewhere in the region , without a return to the peace process between Israel and Palestine that is based on the roadmap and its goal of the two @-@ state solution , with Israel living in peace and security with an independent and viable Palestinian State as its neighbour .
What are we aiming for ?
Mistakes are made because people think that they have to be the ambassador of Israel or of Palestine .
The Lebanese army has to regain control of the whole country , including the south , and it has to exercise a monopoly on military strength to the exclusion of Hizbollah , which in recent times has become a parallel power .

This equates to a disaster for Lebanon and many wounds for Israel , in which there has fortunately been less damage done .
However , we cannot demand this as a precondition for talks ; rather , we must negotiate in order to achieve our goal .
The Lebanese conflict is taking place near us , practically on our doorstep .
I also believe that an international peace conference that does not carry a price for failure for the protagonists in the Middle East will not succeed , nor will it get off the ground .
On the contrary , the United Nations is entering negotiations with Hezbollah ; negotiations with Al @-@ Qaeda will surely follow .
The opportunity must now be grasped to form a genuinely multilateral force , with the participation and commitment of all the interested parties . Its aim must be to solve the problem that lies at the root of all of these conflicts , which is the clash of ideologies between two different cultural blocks .
Mr President , it is obviously important that we also have adequate resources available to repatriate illegal migrants and to monitor that process , but I would also stress here the importance of the comprehensive approach to the problem of illegal immigration .
I would refer at this point to document number 11978 / 06 , which mentions the political consensus reached on the Seventh Framework Programme .
.
A large majority of the Committee on Foreign Affairs endorses this specific approach on account of its indispensable and valuable contribution , for which I extend warm thanks to the Members concerned .
The further opening of the banking and insurance markets , and the advances in the search for common standards , are visible steps forward .
China must respect the fundamental human rights and freedom to make political choices of Taiwan &apos;s 23 million inhabitants .
There are also different interests in play .
This is undoubtedly a Chinese problem , but it is also true that the technology for oppressing Chinese citizens via the Internet comes from the United States and Europe .
Similarly , on the principle of non @-@ interference , China has good relations with maverick regimes ranging from Venezuela to Zimbabwe .
We must therefore face up to reality : 75 % of the Chinese require a great deal of technology in order to get onto a level footing with Kyoto and with the general implementation .
Based on that work the Commission will draft guidelines for the setting @-@ up of eco @-@ labelling schemes and will propose a list of minimum requirements against which private eco @-@ labelling schemes could be assessed .
Instead , there is a range of economic interests often hidden behind this kind of labelling , and this is why , in order to protect the environment and the consumer , we must proceed with great care and assume our responsibilities as political decision makers .
By virtue of the whole exercise undertaken , we will be increasing awareness among the general public .
In addition , it could integrate the current undertakings , as requested in the draft recommendation attached to the annulled Commission decision , and which the United States currently implements .
. - Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the vast majority of us in this House are not opposed to the strengthening of security where that is necessary , nor are they hostile to the United States or to reasonable cooperation with them in those areas in which we and they have cooperated in the past and will need to do so in the future too .
Mr President , I fully endorse the approach of our rapporteur , Mrs in &apos; t Veld .
In any case , Parliament will be kept politically informed by the European Commission .
Anyone who has had the opportunity to travel through Europe , whether to islands such as Madeira , the Canaries , Cyprus or Malta , or to visit rural areas in Tuscany , Scotland , Latvia , Finland , Poland or Provence , knows the beauty and diversity of this European cultural heritage and how readily people can be persuaded to take a stand in its defence .
That is the direction we must take , which would involve a civil society sensitive to the particular fragility of the island regions and with a high degree of environmental awareness .
Among the many points worthy of comment , I should just like to highlight Parliament &apos;s support for relegating EU @-@ China relations to a position of secondary importance behind the framework of the &apos; American initiative of starting a strategic dialogue with Europe on China &apos;s rise - a central new element in the policy of the &apos; new &quot; world towards the &apos; old &quot; , &quot; encouraging &apos; the European Union and its Member States to develop , together with the USA , a strategic consensus for dealing with China . &quot;
The agreement to send troops to the Lebanon betrays ignorance of the rules of engagement .
The negotiations will end up being resumed , but we already know that the Commission has yielded with regard to export subsidies and to the protection of our agriculture and our viticulture against the social dumping of third countries , in which multinationals manufacture goods without there being any labour law or social legislation .
It is necessary to accept a particular definition as to who in Sri Lanka - and I hesitate to resort to such controversial terms , but here goes - is the original host there , and who is the guest who has become too big for his boots , and whose activity is detrimental to the host .
Today , the most vital thing is that we should help to bring matters to a peaceful resolution , and that will be possible only if a distinction is drawn between the terrorists and what actually matters .
Understandably , people risk their lives to escape .
.
The Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance has asked for the addition of a Commission statement on the implementation of food safety legislation ( meat in poor condition ) .
This scandalous suggestion by the Committee on the Environment was justified by saying that the Member States could not do any better . The Member States themselves in the Council , however , have provisionally agreed on a tougher line , where postponement would only be for three years .
- Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Ferber , for his work and for the dynamism that he instilled in the working party and the Committee on Budgetary Control , as well as in the Committee on Budgets .
Education about what Europe has been through and the environment in which it exists is very important for its own development and for the world of the 21st century in which Europe may - and must - play a more important and positive role than in the 20th century , when it was a source of tragedy , war , totalitarianism and other woes on a global scale .
We have seen achievements in telecom and airlines and we will see achievements in new areas , because we are talking about services that are by nature dynamic and convergent .
Let the Commission prepare such an instrument on the basis of the principles I have just restated .
Where there are legal uncertainties , they must be eradicated , issue by issue and sector by sector .
In this report , book loans , education , care , nursing , water , security , hospital treatment and welfare are referred to as &apos; services of general interest &quot; as opposed to the more specific &apos; services of general economic interest &quot; involved in going to the hairdresser or buying a house .
I would therefore call for caution in making services of general economic interest open to the market .
A balance has to be struck between the market on the one hand and the public authorities responsible for public services on the other .
It surprises me that some Members are against that , whereas they are very much in favour of tax harmonisation between Member States .
The questions that Parliament raised in 2005 when it assessed the proposal at first reading have been taken on board .
It is important that we find the means to resettle them in productive endeavours .
I should also like to highlight the eTwinning project , which is charged with linking up educational institutions from different European countries in order to set up joint projects .
In Belgium alone , nearly 13.000 people die prematurely every year as a result of particles given off by diesel engines in particular .
We do not have debates in this institution , but tightly controlled and orchestrated speaking time , without the opportunity for reply .
Given that there are a number of ideas aimed at solving environmental issues and the congestion that our cities suffer are beset with , I feel that we should be channelling our efforts into addressing the impact on public health and the quality of life , in terms of socio @-@ economic dynamism .
We will then report to the European Parliament and to the Council by June 2007 .

The people belonging to the Hungarian minority in Romania or the Turkish minority in Bulgaria also have problems to contend with , even though those to a lesser degree than in the recent past .
A year &apos;s delay would probably have meant that both sides would no longer make the effort and it would lead to automatic membership of some sort .
If Croatia , which is likely to be the next new member , pursues reforms with rigour and results , it should be ready to join the Union around the end of this decade .
That is , fortunately , something that is clearly formulated in the Eurlings report , on which we are agreed , and I am in no doubt as to Mr Eurlings &quot; intentions in that respect .
It is for this reason , in particular , that it is so important to us that Turkey have the prospect of membership - have a path towards EU membership - as this is a means of lending support to this dialogue .
I shall avoid introducing distractions - new criteria that do not help a process that is already in itself difficult and requires us to be transparent , consistent and objective .
I can assure you that it is a difficult line : we will not demand the recognition of the Armenian genocide as a prerequisite , but , ladies and gentlemen , it is nonetheless quite clear that , when the time comes to review the situation prior to accession , this sensitive point will weigh very heavily in the balance , and Turkey knows it .
Anything else would be unfair to the Turkish people , who are pinning their hopes on us .
Perhaps , however , we will have the answer to this later on .
I can inform you that Mr Rehn had other commitments and could not be present at this sitting .
Such a solution would in fact be called Schengen 1 + .
Researchers pay for their own travel and hotel costs , make their contribution , and may have to wait several months before the Commission pays the expenses and pays for the work done .
Of course it must be carried out under certain rules and criteria and , if that is the case , then benefits will continue to be gained by those who are more open .
I am going to present a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council in January 2007 on the workings and application of this regulation .
Bearing this in mind , I must once again applaud the initiative to create PROGRESS , a new employment and social solidarity programme for the Community .
However , we began the Rapkay report this morning and we then went on with the continuation as foreseen in the original agenda .
Mr President , first of all I should like to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his report and for the excellent cooperation .
Looking back , I should like to express my most sincere thanks for the cooperation I have received on the report on the strategic guidelines .
I therefore think that we need to breathe new life into the Lisbon Strategy .
In our quest to meet the challenges facing the EU on the world stage and in light of our new size and scale , we must always ensure that all parties are involved , be they social partners , NGOs , local authorities or regional authorities .
- First of all , I would like to thank all my colleagues , the colleagues at the Commission and the Council and of course Mrs Krehl for the effort they have made on behalf of improving the guidelines .
Moreover , there are also regions in Europe - Bavaria and North Netherlands for example - that are prepared to invest money from the structural funds in developing this further .
To this end , we hope that the Member States will demonstrate flexibility , so that we might find a solution that satisfies everyone .
It is our responsibility and a challenge to parliamentary competence , both in the European Parliament and the national parliaments , to respond together to the demand being made of Europe that it should be a fair and safe place for everyone to live .
.
Finally , President Bush has acknowledged the existence of secret CIA prisons .
Her gesture has been reported in the Italian and Polish press , and I would like to convey my deep gratitude to her .
In the short term , together with significant improvement to the European Union &apos;s external border controls it is necessary to come to an agreement on a comprehensive and structured immigration policy .
How much longer does the Council believe we can go on without fundamental rights and a court at EU level competent to re @-@ examine cases ?
It is scandalous that a number of Member States haggle over their solidarity and shameful that one Member State should have to beg for help from the others in order to perform a task that is in everyone &apos;s interests .
The Council needs to take responsibility for sending out a strong , effective signal to make this a Community issue .
This situation has repercussions for all the countries of the European Union since , as everyone knows , a migrant whose papers have been put in order may move freely within a large part of the EU &apos;s territory .
A great deal has been said about prevention , protection and maritime borders , referring to the Mediterranean .
We are therefore adding the words &apos; which should be . &quot;
I shall be voting in favour of this report .
. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism on the Commission White Paper on Services of General Interest ( SGIs ) , I fought for the following :
Talk about hypocrisy !
Europe has a duty to help this country on the road to democracy , but because of its geography , history and culture , Turkey cannot claim to be part of the European Union &apos;s political project .
Mr President , I welcome this realistic report , though do think it could have been stronger .
Several neighbouring countries , such as Chad , the Central African Republic and Uganda , and even countries further afield , such as Somalia and the Republic of Congo , could be forced to suffer the effects of this .
The third and final priority is , of course , the establishment , as quickly as possible , of a United Nations force that can go and strengthen that of the African Union , which is all the same playing an important role that should be consolidated .
There is a need for clarity , not least within the European Union , the dilemma in the Security Council is that China and Russia are preventing anything being done .
Much as the expansion of the African peace mission to 11.000 police officers and soldiers in the Western Sudan is to be welcomed , the African Union &apos;s continuing and collective support for UN troops shows that this can be seen as no more than a transitional measure .
First , President Barroso and my colleague Louis Michel will be going to Khartoum .
Finally , I also share the committee &apos;s concern about the low level of intra @-@ regional trade in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and its recommendation to SAARC to review opportunities to expand trade and investment in the region .
On the European side , there has to be a fair , open approach aimed at reinforcing Europe &apos;s presence in India and duly supporting our initiatives in that part of the world .
We therefore cannot regard India merely as a huge pool of cheap labour .
An agreement with India would present various advantages , such as the consolidation of the European Union &apos;s privileged position in an important and growing market .
The services of the gender helpdesk are part of a larger effort to build capacity and knowledge to promote gender equality and fully implement the strategy of gender mainstreaming .
Rather , they tend to suffer the detrimental consequences of the liberalisation of trade .
I also noted with satisfaction that the Conference of Committee Chairmen expressed its appreciation of the Commission &apos;s communication on the economic difficulties of the sector .
This will be a problem for the restructuring of fishing fleets by implementing decommissioning schemes .
They are also part of a rich culture and heritage .
It appears to me essential that , if we want to retain a support base for fisheries , we should accord these Regional Advisory Councils a fully @-@ fledged place in the debate and that we get them to make a contribution prior to the debate as well .
Are there any lessons for the CFP there ?
First and foremost , it should be clarified and highlighted that the practice of finning has been regulated by the EU since 2003 , meaning that sharks cannot be caught solely for their fins .
In most parts of the world the percentage of fins that can be landed by fishing is lower .
I believe that those are the risks that we may run .
It is a small sector , but I share Mr Parish &apos;s concern that any crack in confidence will destroy it .
Furthermore , an emphasis on nanoscience and nanotechnology is critical to reaching the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy .
I wish to express my appreciation and support for the report before us , which confirms that this is one of the key technologies of the 21st century .
What I expect of the European Union is that it should give the USA an answer , and our answer , the European response to nanotechnology , far from being that we are willing to follow technology in a lemming @-@ like fashion , must be that we will take a socially responsible approach and consider the risks involved .
If we were to compare ourselves to the United States , we would find that in many areas we are not lagging behind .
Thanks to the European Consensus , we now have all the necessary tools to achieve this goal .
The report proposes a working group in which representatives of civil society should be involved .
We therefore regret that the majority in Parliament voted against the amendments tabled by our group , which were aimed at condemning the use of Galileo for military purposes and which emphasised that the programme should enable equal access for all users .
Although there are some concerns expressed in the report that we share , it forms part of a strategy of liberalising world trade within the framework of the WTO or via the proliferation of bilateral or multilateral agreements on free trade , within the framework of competition and ties with the USA , to which we are firmly opposed .
The report acknowledges the economic difficulties facing the sector .
This time , though , there was something of an improvement , and I hope that that will continue .
I totally agree , but there is one argument that you have not mentioned , and , because of your silence , that is the one that I am led to wonder about and that , while we are still without a solution , currently leaves those that I represent in a rather negative state of uncertainty .
We see that as the only solution if the Council is going to keep sitting on this for so long .
We are currently approving the Minutes .

Nothing less is acceptable , and we have to achieve that now ; we can be flexible on modalities and specifics , but we must be firm on the principles .
In 2005 , it was reported from Pyongyang that the country was in possession of nuclear weapons , and the test was carried out at the beginning of this week .
We decided to hold the Lahti Summit because we want to give the Heads of State or Government of the Member States of the Union the opportunity for an open and informal debate on two themes which are important for the Union &apos;s future and for economic success : innovation and external energy relations .
As I have already said , the strategic partnership is a framework within which all the important issues will be discussed .
Is it not strange that the European Union has dialogue with Asia and Latin America at the level of Heads of State and Government , but not with Africa ?
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Anna Politkovskaya , visited this House on two occasions , at the invitation of our group , to report to us on the situation in Chechnya and the state of play as regards freedom of speech in Russia .
Only when the EU sends a clear signal that we value the life of this courageous woman not less than oil and gas will things start to change in Russia .
That way , the markets will open up both in Russia and the European Union under the same rules ; that is , an energy agreement will be ratified in the same package .
Mr Barroso , some of the competences we have in the European Union - the internal market for energy policy , the trans @-@ European networks , competition rules and trade policy - are the instruments that we must use with relation not only to Russia but also to other parts of the world .
With regard to external energy , you know what you need to do : you need to thank Mr Putin for the fact that it is actually on the agenda , because at about this time last year he was squeezing the Ukrainian pipelines a little bit and that is the reason we are actually talking about it in Lahti .
The aim is to start these talks as soon as possible .
You said that we have agreed to move to a &apos; push system &apos; : I am sorry , but that is not what I read .
I do not believe that I am speaking just for myself ; I consider rather that this Parliament has every reason not to trust the CIA .
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the definitive results of the anti @-@ dumping investigation concerning footwear from China and Vietnam , by Enrique Barón Crespo , on behalf of the Committee on International Trade - B6 @-@ 0432 / 2006 ) .
Once again , let me highlight the case of the workers of the multinational C &#91; amp &#93; J Clark in Castelo de Paiva who , three years after the company &apos;s closure and following repeated promises , remain without alternative employment .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the matter addressed by Mr Barón Crespo &apos;s question flows from the case of the footwear sector , because the entire production system of Member States has been thrown into a crisis , and not merely from today , by unfair competition - or , to put it more plainly , by the remorseless and unbridled financial greed of the so @-@ called free market : a market that would be better defined as being without rules , which preys on individuals like a vampire , exploiting workers without paying heed to their age and without any social security remotely comparable to that which is in force in countries of the European Union .
( ES ) Mr President , I take note of Commissioner Rehn &apos;s expression of disapproval , but I believe that what has happened today must be looked into by the Presidency and the Conference of Presidents , because it shows a lack of respect for Parliament , particularly on the part of the Council .
I agree with Mr Kacin that periodic reports should be submitted on the operation of local ...
Nonetheless we are now witnessing live the escalation of violations of the rules of international law perpetrated by Russia against Georgia : the granting of Russian citizenship to the people of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , the rejection of the peace plan proposed by Georgia to settle the conflicts with the separatist regions and the closure of the two border crossing points .
It is obvious that the Russian Federation cannot accept that it has lost its influence over the Georgian Republic .
The Commission needs and intends to consult widely during the coming months , including with Member States and stakeholders , on the expectations for such a centre .
Simply increasing taxes on unfair exporters will not bring any results .
Minimum standards of animal protection - as per Amendment 11 - are necessary .
Parliament expressed its views on this on the basis of the reports from 2001 and 2003 .
The Commission supports the removal of fixed and minimum prices and the use of result @-@ based fees .
All in all , however , the report puts forward the known liberalisation demands and even goes beyond them by approving , for instance , the area of investment as the subject of a chapter in the EU @-@ Mercosur agreement .
The difficult situation on the berry market has had the biggest impact on farmers in the poorest region in Europe , Lubelszczyźna , which produces one sixth of total output .
The process of harmonisation between the three institutions was a very important , happy and instructive experience for us .
The second , and , in particular , the third pillar , must be fully within the Agency &apos;s remit , for if they are not , it will become clear to the people that , where fundamental rights - the most vulnerable area of policy - are concerned , the governments are not taking citizens &apos; rights as seriously as they ought to .
It will guarantee that the legislation of every Member State accords with our European principles .
The Council of Europe has wide @-@ ranging supervisory and monitoring rights .
Do we really believe that it is not worth having 50 people working to maintain a high level of vigilance in connection with human rights in Europe ?
( FR ) &apos; The Agency &apos;s remit enables it to provide protection for human rights not only in the field of terrorism and organised crime but also in other fields , such as trafficking in persons , offences against children , illicit drug and arms trafficking and corruption and fraud , where measures can also weaken the effectiveness of the protection of human rights &apos; .
Since 1953 , this function has been performed at the highest level by the well @-@ respected European Court of Human Rights , to which many more states are party than there are EU Member States , and the process has been highly successful .
The first concerns the condemnation - happily not adopted - of bullfighting , because this issue hardly justifies concern on the part of the EU .

Poverty such as exists in Bangladesh may also be found in Europe .
( HU ) 50 years ago today , revolution broke out in Hungary .
It is therefore incumbent on us to enlighten the citizens and also certain Members of this House as to why we have a common agricultural policy , what its benefits are and why consumers have to pay its costs .
I understand the concerns of the new Member States following the Commission &apos;s announcement that there has been a delay in implementing the system .
Producing law at record speed is efficient , but it cannot be denied that this efficiency comes at the expense of transparency .
Unfortunately , we have recently been informed that Schengen enlargement will be delayed for technical reasons because the preparatory work for the second generation of the Schengen Information System SIS II will not be completed on time .
Parliament , the Council and the Commission have shown that they are capable of working together to reach a balanced compromise .
When that person starts life all over again in a foreign culture and language , he or she is working for the benefit of another society .
Communication is therefore an absolutely central issue .
Europe needs transparency , and so does its system of grants and subsidies .
That makes it all the more important that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted , unanimously , a draft report on the basis of which the plenary will now adopt a resolution of its own .
In this way we will ensure that the transparency directive tools are adapted to improvements in the market .
Secondly , it ensures that all the countries receive a minimum percentage of the funding .
The problem is that the funds are being spent on staff and not on environmental projects .
Today every Member State bears responsibility for organising the transportation of its own civil protection aid .
These are the main issues on which the Commission &apos;s position differs from that taken in the European Parliament report .
( The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m. )
What that represents is a completely different concept , namely that of voluntarily joining an international community through free self @-@ determination rather than being forcibly pushed into a community of force .
We should not so much condemn the Soviet Union &apos;s imperial actions , but rather strongly condemn those who , at the time , enthusiastically chose to support the invasion , in the name of communist and socialist internationalism .
I am encouraged by the great interest that the committee has shown in this issue . I would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent collaboration , which really deserves to be acknowledged .
( Applause )
It follows that the increased incidence of cancer can also be linked to the feminist concept of womanhood , which aims to deprive women of motherhood , exploit them as a potential part of the workforce and practically force them to control their so @-@ called reproductive life , which virtually amounts to perceiving them as animals .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioners , I should like to start by thanking my fellow Members for their hard work and for the clarity of their comments .
This highlights how important it is that there should be a charter of rights for people with chronic illnesses at work , and I think that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will be concerning itself with that issue .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is already a year since , at first reading , we welcomed the excellent work by the rapporteur , whom I would like to congratulate once again on her more recent work .
In addition to all of this , I would like to highlight the provision for special actions aimed at raising awareness among Europe &apos;s citizens of cultural diversity in the Member States .
First of all , this is the competence and basic responsibility of Member States .
I voted for the amendments to the common position on LIFE + .
It is because the report makes no such requirement that I have voted against it .
Indeed it is a rare budget when we find that we do not yet have some of the programmes in place , because the multiannual programmes are in the process now of being completed as , let us hope , the Financial Regulation will be in place for the beginning of next year to be the basis for our operation .
Both Parliament and the Council must also respect this aspect of the content of the new interinstitutional agreement .
Secondly , I should like to mention Parliament &apos;s budget for communicating with our citizens .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mrs Wideroos , Mrs Grybauskaitė , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first of all to thank our two rapporteurs , Mr Elles and Mr Grech , who , through the work they have done and the tenacity they have shown , have been able to give direction to our work on this first reading of the budget .
There is also the important issue of economic migration from the new Member States to the countries of the old Union and the consequent rapidly rising social and economic costs in the poor countries .
That is what she said in committee .
The report from the Court of Auditors that was presented this morning gives me reason to believe that there is a great potential there for more to be achieved .

In every other area of telecoms - fixed and broadband - European consumers are seeing significant improvements in price , choice and quality ; only for international roaming has this not been the case .
Can the Commission offer an opinion explaining the reason for discrepancies between the figures for the EU average and the figures for Irish applicants ?
If the DDA fails , or if the suspension is extended for too long a period of time , my firm judgement is that we run serious economic and political risks .
I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive answer .
I am sure that this consensus makes it probable that in the coming weeks we will be able to adopt , in the full sense of the legal term , the Youth in Action Programme .
Annex - Commission statement
Europe is lacking in raw materials - that much is a fact - and so it is all the more important that we should develop the potential in the people who live here .
With regard to visas and cooperation with other countries , as of 1 January 2007 Member States should implement or transpose the visa facilitation decision for students , lecturers and researchers throughout the European Union , with the exception of the UK , Ireland and Denmark .
There is no doubt that the Europe for Citizens programme can become a success .
We are in a battle for the hearts and minds of public opinion and we cannot allow the sceptics simply to have the best tunes .
The proposed Directive will not only ensure the protection of human health and of the environment , but also serve to strengthen the internal market , as it introduces Community @-@ wide harmonised rules for the marketing and use of PFOS and related substances .
A study of people from 17 countries by the World Wide Fund for Nature found that PFOS and six other perfluorinated compounds were present in people &apos;s bodies .
Both the diplomatic and the litigation approaches have met with notable successes .
At the same time , however , we are against distorting competition and against our partners &apos; achieving competitive advantages by relying on underhand practices in infringement of international trade rules .
This form of words is a bad sign , since , if the negotiations fail , the blame is already being laid at the doors of the Spanish and French states .
Let us seize the opportunity and give our support .
The Finnish Government too has set a good example here , promising to contribute EUR 70 million over a seven @-@ year period .
In Lahti there was a clear sense of solidarity , an understanding that the European Union will act as one and that Europeans should receive the same standards of reliability from our Russian partners , whichever Member State is concerned .
I have already made it in modified form on numerous occasions .
Furthermore , economically and in terms of energy , we both need each other .
This is the world of the imaginary , of dreams .
We have to get to a stage where over the long term carbon dioxide emissions will be cut by 60 @-@ 80 % , and this can only happen if we have a genuine common will as Europeans to invest in renewable sources of energy and energy savings .
Let us set a good example for Mr Putin and the Russian democrats !
President Barroso has been sure to champion Europe &apos;s energy rights . That is his duty .
I knew that UKIP members are divorced from reality , but even then I am astonished at Godfrey Bloom &apos;s speech , in which he seemed to imply that Britain was self @-@ sufficient on energy and did not need to work with , or even talk to , other countries .
Nothing is dearer to them than their regained human dignity . &apos; 
Do not compromise your independence or prestige , because neither you nor this Parliament deserve that .
The next item is the vote .
We rejoice to see that the independence movement and the Spanish state are finally seeking a peaceful solution together and that most groups in this House are backing this process .
Rather , what we have is , on the one hand , a free , democratic country that respects autonomies and , on the other , a people that has suffered from the indiscriminate , unjustifiable violence of a terrorist group .
As a representative of the Czech people , I am not particularly interested in the technical and legal problems involved in the introduction of the SIS II system , to which the Commission has recently referred .
This approach is exemplified by agricultural aid , whereby agricultural products are subsidised with the result that similar products from other countries - in many cases , developing countries - cannot be sold in the EU market .
Let me also mention that the OSCE played a very helpful role in refusing to observe and recognise the referendum in Transnistria and also in returning the Russian officers from Georgia to Russia .
The hysterical tirades directed by the Moscow media against Georgians living in Russia mean that they do not feel safe on the territory of the Russian Federation .
Mr President , as far as the background to this debate is concerned , we need a very strong EU commitment in the form of peacekeeping forces to try to prevent the spread of those dangerous conflicts .
I will now move on to deal with the oral question put by Karl @-@ Heinz Florenz , Chairman of the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
How is it possible that the Proba Koala was not stopped from causing so much pollution ?
In Estonia , you stated that the dumping of toxic waste in Ivory Coast was only the tip of the iceberg .
If Europe wants to make headway , it will need to explain to its citizens where the added value for them lies .
Nevertheless , we have tried where we can , and where we feel it is of interest for the people of Syria .
What is certain is that supplies of weapons to the Lebanon cannot be wholly stopped without Syria &apos;s consent , and that must be seen to be a factor .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council .
Is the Council also considering doing something to relieve the burden , for example mounting information campaigns in the countries of origin , in order to make potential migrants aware of the possible consequences of illegal immigration or of the other options available for legal immigration ?
I thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for her reply .
The decision by the SAARC ministerial council to confer on the EU the role of observer is a splendid opportunity to develop cooperation between SAARC and the EU .
The Commissioner told us at a recent briefing that he does not expect spectacular breakthroughs .
What makes this especially challenging is the effect that one @-@ sided efforts have on the markets .
We must start implementing the Action Programme as a matter of urgency .
More pressing projects than these projects that are probably underutilised include the widening of the narrow canals that connect Northern France with Belgium and the Netherlands , or returning the ever dwindling transport across the Danube between Hungary and the Black Sea ever since the bombardments of 1999 back to its original level .
Complaints and Commission proceedings make municipalities and investors nervous about making investments at home and initiating projects , and so it is necessary for the European Union to take action .
Let us hope that the text will be adopted tomorrow .
To begin with , the Commission must look more closely at the costs and benefits of a binding initiative on the granting of concessions , and at other measures suitable for dealing with the problems at stake .
We must join forces in order to call a halt to bureaucracy and exploitation .
The Commissioner said earlier that it is difficult to protect workers while ensuring free movement of services ; but , regardless of how difficult it is , we must do so .
( DE ) Mr President , I wish the Posting of Workers Directive were no longer needed , and I am sure that the Commissioner is thinking along similar lines .
Since then the Governing Council has continued to withdraw monetary accommodation , thereby establishing the minimum bid rate of the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem at 3.25 % by now .
If this were not the case , the gap would continue to widen between our institutions and the various peoples .
This is why it is important to carry on making progress on the Economic and Monetary Union , in order to achieve new goals , but also in order to maintain the efficiency of the monetary policy in the face of new challenges .
( DE ) Mr President , on behalf of my group , too , I would like to support the rapporteur &apos;s motion .
14 . Posting of workers ( vote )
This does not automatically mean , however , that more funds should be made available for priority budget lines .
In another of its neighbours , Israel , it is considered to be a most unreasonable neighbour , one that never wants peace or reconciliation , and Syria &apos;s actions can be used as one of the arguments not to actively broker a peace agreement with a Palestinian neighbour .
That is one of the things that we have stated clearly in the debates on the Services Directive .
The policy of force and repression imposed on the people of Tibet by the Chinese authorities can no longer be tolerated .
It appeared to be an unprovoked attack .
Has the US State Department not had any straight @-@ thinking , sensible people with average IQ working in it over the last few decades ?
The government says that 169 people died , whereas the opposition puts the figure at 745 .
When I came in , I found that the vote had already been taken on the Resolution on Tibet and on another one , and I would now like to inform the Secretariat of the way I would have voted in the votes I was unable to participate in because the services made me leave my office and I was unable to come down to the Chamber .
Why would the Italian Government make no attempt to reconsider its past history ?
I hope that the European Commission will not listen to the Fidesz party .
We call on the Commission to provide us , in subsequent reports , with a more specific toolbox in order to promote such talks , and we invite the Commissioner and the Council to meet with us every three months .
When I listened earlier to my Swedish colleague , it sounded as though it was a problem for the European economy to have low interest rates .
A substantial element in strengthening the euro zone is expanding it and taking on new members .
The Mediterranean is under serious threat from uncontrolled development of its coastline .
I think this sum is inadequate .
We must no longer think of nature as being something without value as , if we do so , the consequences may be incalculable .
In the Water Framework Directive , successfully adopted in 2000 due to the fact that Mrs Lienemann was the rapporteur , &apos; good environmental status &apos; is called for by 2015 , that is to say , 15 years after the adoption of the directive .
To a failure to comply with procedures ?
Although the CAP health check cannot be viewed as a mid @-@ term review , we are aware of the internal and external pressures to make changes that go beyond merely simplifying the processes .
In that way , the Commissioner may well be able to use a good timetable that leads to a more market @-@ oriented focus and , as a member of the Dutch Christian Democratic party , the CDA , I would very much welcome it if the Commissioner were to adopt this line .
We are all wondering what will happen if we end the quota system for milk production .
For all these reasons , I do not support the abolition of the milk quota system .
This is tantamount to blackmail and coming from a government that has imposed more than 80 stealth taxes , from a Chancellor - Gordon Brown - who has made taxation in the UK higher than Germany or France and now wants us to believe that he needs to slash 25 % off our farmers &apos; single @-@ farm payments in order to be able to afford agri @-@ environment schemes , it is an absolute joke .
( PL ) Mr President , the proposal for so @-@ called &apos; voluntary modulation &apos; by the Member States as regards direct payments to agriculture will in effect lead to a cut of some 20 % in the funds paid out to farmers , which will be in breach of the norms and procedures prevailing in the European Union .
When I reread the Presidency Conclusions , these seven lines of text read worse now than they did almost a year ago .
( ET ) Madam President , Mr Weber , ladies and gentlemen , I presented my initial position concerning the annual report to the Committee on Budgetary Control on 23 October .
There still remains much to be done , therefore .
Only if this is done will we be able to give discharge for 2005 .
Sensationalist press articles then classify all these as &apos; fraud &apos; , which they are not .
At the moment , it is not clear what is to happen regarding the rights of ownership of the assets produced through the SESAR Joint Undertaking when the ownership of SESAR is at some point transferred to industry .
It is not the case that new technology needs to be developed first ; the alternatives have been in existence for some considerable time .
In Poland we have a saying , &apos; when man hurries , the devil smiles &apos; . Evidently the devil wants to get rich selling electronic measuring devices , while speaking fine words about people &apos;s health .
You propose a pragmatic and nuanced approach calling for focused measures accompanied by comprehensive impact assessments .
16 . Measuring devices containing mercury ( vote )
For this vision to succeed , in essence , the poetry of democracy must be supported by the prose of the rule of law .
During that period , more than 500 000 Georgians perished in the gulags , including several members of my own family .
And now the same people are being picked up on the streets of Moscow .
Historically , of course , for species such as carp , trout and so on , there proved to be no repercussions in the areas in which they were released .
In view of the highly toxic nature of this substance for human beings , ecosystems and nature , restrictions are needed on the marketing of these products .
My farmers in the Witham and Maldon area - around Coggeshall , Terling , the Teys and the Tolleshunts - as in other parts of England , want a fair deal from the common agricultural policy .
First , we renewed the Lisbon Agenda and placed the emphasis squarely on growth and jobs .
Firstly , the drawing up in parallel of two lists of priorities inevitably creates some confusion concerning the relative importance to be attached to each type of objective and concerning the links between the two categories .
That is why we think it necessary to put restrictive arrangements in place , similar to those with which we are familiar in connection with budgetary discipline . By that , I mean that the European Union should not only assume obligations in terms of results but also give itself sufficient resources .
That is why we must continue to be coherent over time , and to be so in the interests of a Europe that is not only more competitive but also characterised by greater solidarity and by greater resolve on the world stage .
On the other hand , a social model based on rigid and short working time , and on avoiding competition not just at a global level but at the level of the common market is the road to social and economic crisis .
This is the main reason why I believe that we need to put across a clearer summary of the truly significant propositions of our programmes .
We want these objectives to take particular account of circumstances in the new Member States , which will receive funds but will also need to be in a position to use those funds wisely .
And why is the Commission going along with the Council in informal get @-@ togethers on security policy , such as the ones on 16 August or with the US last week ?
Delivery is fundamental .
So what is Europe ?
I think I am speaking on behalf of all my colleagues when I say that we have welcomed this and have enjoyed that debate and interaction with the European Parliament .
A Commission decision on the future strategy is to be adopted at the end of the year .
The current excise duty rates were established in 1992 and came into effect on 1 January 1993 .
There is also a programme targeting HIV / AIDS in the field of education - the programme on AIDS in higher education , HEAIDS - which has received EUR 20 million .
We , in Europe , have the impression that we have suddenly unearthed a phenomenon that did not previously exist .
The Action Programme for Decent Work covers freely chosen productive employment and a respect for rights at work , as well as labour standards , dialogue between the Social Partners , social security and gender equality .
( FI ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union took an active role in the first and second session of the Human Rights Council .
Among the legislative measures and other measures which have recently been adopted or which are to be adopted soon , it is worth mentioning in particular the European Parliament and Council Directive of 2005 for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy @-@ using products and the European Parliament and Council Directive of 2006 on energy end @-@ use efficiency and energy services .
However those measures must be necessary , proportionate and non @-@ discriminatory .
The Member States must be able to authorise and control public and private operators in the context of fair competition .
Our society was formed under the influence of Jacobinist states .
The rapporteur &apos;s radical intentions are demonstrated by the fact that he has ended up voting against his own report in committee .
Some of these can only improve over time .
It led to there being a symbiosis between the interests of employees and consumers and those of the economy .
The common objective and intention to develop the internal market has nevertheless remained unchanged .
These are not trifling matters ; they are the fundamental issues that were used by the opponents of the Constitution to obtain a &apos; no &apos; vote in the French referendum .
This is about Europe , China and India .
My group is less enthusiastic .
We have shown leadership and cut the Gordian knot .
In the Member States , including Poland , the Directive provides much hope for better job opportunities , which is something that many service providers and consumers have been eagerly waiting for .
I am also happy that the European Parliament played a very strong role in this , and would like to congratulate the Finnish Presidency , Mr Pekkarinen , and especially Mrs Satu Mäkinen , who has redefined what a tough Finnish negotiator can be .
This directive is of huge importance to my own country because it is a net exporter or goods and services .
I would also like to point out that we have a visit from the President of the Parliament of Ukraine , who is in the official gallery .
This is a key aspect of the issue , and one which the EU must incorporate into its policy of openness towards , and cooperation with , the rest of the world .
The text in no way clarifies the ambiguities that remain concerning the protection of public services and consumers .
Crucial provisions such as those on the posting of workers have disappeared , and I regret that .
During a military operation by Israel , several people died in Beit Hanoun on 8 November , and in a disastrous barrage of artillery fire almost 20 Palestinians , women and children included , lost their lives as they were leaving the area .
I have no expectations of terrorist organisations .
I also condemn the deaths of the 18 civilians in the shelling of Beit Hanoun by the Israeli defence forces last week .
The second point is that , seen in an international context , the Middle East conflict has now reached such proportions that it is at the heart of efforts to safeguard world peace and also of threats to such peace .
On behalf of the Council , I can assure you that the Union and the Presidency will do whatever it can .
We also support the need to focus more attention on strengthening and ensuring compliance with international humanitarian law in this area .
Despite all of this , the Council appears to be sticking to a passive approach .
They are very ambitious , and right now the work of the Council work is focussed on finalising decisions on the financial instrument , leading to a common civil protection instrument .
It is a Baltic Sea Strategy for the Northern Dimension , so the aim is to strengthen that concept .
Right now the European Commission is drafting a new and wide @-@ ranging European maritime policy , one which takes account of the economic , political and environmental values associated with Europe &apos;s seas and coastal areas .
The next step could be that the European Parliament might draft a new comprehensive report on the Northern Dimension that would take account of the Baltic Sea report now being discussed , on the one hand , and the agreements concluded with our neighbouring countries , Russia , Norway and Iceland , on the other .
We need a modern visa policy and better economic cooperation with Russia .
I would also like to inform the representatives of the Council and the Commission that Russia is hindering free travel on the Baltic Sea by not permitting ships to pass through the straits between the Vistula Lagoon and Kaliningrad .
On the other hand - although we will be endorsing most of the amendments that add precision to the parts of the text that have to do with diplomacy , civil society and disarmament - we do not believe that crisis prevention must , under all conceivable circumstances , involve the use of exclusively non @-@ military means .
What is certain is that the future will see the EU taking on more and more international commitments , and the disturbing developments in the Middle East , in North Korea and in Iran are harbingers of this trend .
However , the report we are now debating is the worst I have seen so far .
I am grateful to the committee , which debated this issue at length and thoroughly examined all aspects of it .
Without parity of representation , democracy is incomplete and does not work properly .
I should like to conclude , Madam President , with a rhetorical question .
That is the real situation .
Whenever I have met trafficked women , they have said that they have been bought and that they have been sold into prostitution and marketed to clients in a great many EU countries day in , day out , all year round .
The causes include : unemployment , hunger , poverty affecting large parts of society , high indirect labour costs , competition and the desire to achieve maximum profit .
Commissioner Wallström &apos;s idea in designing the new procedure was to give individual Commissioners greater ownership of cases , while fully maintaining the valuable role of the Secretariat @-@ General .
We need to think about ways in which we can bring these various strands together so that our citizens feel that their issues are being answered promptly and that they are being directed to the right recipient .
He should continue to do that .
I view myself as an external mechanism of control over the administration and therefore , if everything else fails , yes , I will also have to act as a Rottweiler .
However , we feel that much more can be done .
Its objective , through and from the peoples &apos; money , such as the PRINCE programme , through what are supposedly information actions , is to improve its propaganda and to lobby for the adoption of the European Constitution , which militarises Europe and condemns the people to fewer rights and constant austerity and for tolerance and acceptance of its policy overall .
This White Paper , too , will be successful only if the Member States commit themselves to developing and supporting a new , common European communication policy .
Thank you , Commissioner .
In view of that , the European Parliament - while dodging the issue of having endorsed EU participation in the financial blockade of the Palestinian Authority - condemns the Israeli army for the massacre it committed and for its action , which it terms &apos; disproportionate &apos; .
However , as an aim of the report is to harmonise laws on succession and wills , we wish to stress emphatically our view that a harmonisation of the substantive law is undesirable and that , under the EC Treaty , this area must be , and indeed remain , a solely national competence .
It is not enough , however , to focus on immigration laws .
The Commission proposed a draft regulation to this effect in July 2004 .
However , we must ask ourselves whether Turkey is ready to join the European Union .
It must also demand that an international inquiry into the 2005 massacres be set up and that those responsible for the massacres be brought to justice .
The last &apos; Reporters without Borders &apos; report reveals hundreds of attacks on freedom of the press .
Author . - ( CS ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , no one can now be in any doubt that neoconservative policies , including the doctrine of global intervention , have failed .
It has been suggested today that it is clear that we should cooperate with the United States , as the USA is a power which is prepared to intervene at moments when the European Union will not sanction a military intervention , at least until it has its own military capability .
Since we joined Europe in 1973 , our national wealth stood at just 60 per cent of the European average at that stage .
We can only communicate a positive message if we have a positive message to communicate .

Mr Voggenhuber was right that a reflection of one and a half years has not brought us very far .
The public want a constitution because they can see that it is about a political community , and because what they had been promised was the political unification of Europe , the political unification of this continent .
We need to have agricultural policies that do not undermine the fight against global poverty and we need effective leadership .
So sometimes that is the issue about legitimacy and democracy .
The question is whether data can be dealt with on the basis of a computer @-@ based system .
Should Russia succeed in dividing us now , it will go one step further next year , and in the meantime our common foreign policy will be two steps behind .
Suddenly an oil pipeline cracks , and oil no longer reaches the Mazeiku refinery .
The existing principles of separation of access to third country markets by individual Member States result in an uneven playing field for exports and discriminatory treatment of certain Member States .
My group will support Amendment 5 by the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left on the efforts made by Romania towards accession and will vote against the same group &apos;s Amendment 4 , which is already covered by the report .
In Craiova , Ploiesti and Filiasi I witnessed for myself the interest that the Romanians have in accession and the impact that integration will have on their daily lives .
The fact is that these over @-@ hasty enlargement rounds will get us no nearer to a sustainable European Union or enable us to achieve the result about which we in this House talk ceaselessly and to which I - as a pro @-@ European - continue to be committed .
We will debate this at the December part @-@ session .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , in the debate that we are having at present , it is important not to get everything mixed up and not to confuse all the various responsibilities .
Precarious existences have become the norm , and pitting employees against each other has become a managerial strategy , like redundancies and unemployment .
In situations in which human rights and democracy are particularly at risk , and which call for rapid action on the part of the Community , I propose that talks should be called at short notice with a small group of MEPs representing the relevant committees of your House .
In a democracy , elections are indispensable , but not enough .
Mr President , in Ireland we are in the middle of a 16 @-@ day campaign to highlight the issue of domestic violence .
I would like to express a heartfelt &apos; thank you &apos; to the rapporteur for his openness and constant collaboration .
Finland , in its capacity as President of the Council , has been able to rely in its work on the results achieved by former presidencies , especially that of Austria .
It may well be argued that this figure is somewhat arbitrary and that indirect costs should be calculated as accurately as possible .
In my view the interconnections of Framework Programme 7 at regional level , in other words the ability to put together in synergy the resources of Framework Programme 7 and the Structural Funds , with the possibility of involving the regions in investment , could be truly productive in the future , both in research infrastructure and in the regions of knowledge and the regional districts of production .
I greatly welcome the effort made to invest in basic research through the creation of an entity that would be independent of the Commission , charged with giving its judgment on the merits of a scientific proposal to be financed under the aegis of Framework Programme 7 .
Parliament has given its support to this excellent package , and my group does too .
I thank you therefore for the clarifications you have given us this evening , but you know that some explanations remain incomplete , just as the wording of the common position is ambiguous .
We in this House have done something for which the Council had promised us additional financial aid ; we have done it with money from the programme , and that was not an easy thing for us to do .
It remains no less true , however , that research , if it is the subject of a policy based on the pursuit of excellence , is one of the few areas in which the European Union can truly deliver better results than national activities could achieve .
However , the mechanisms in place across the Member States to implement these principles vary widely in practice .
The biggest increase in the past two years has been observed in Eastern Asia , Eastern Europe and Central Asia , where the number of people infected with HIV has risen by 21 % .
For this reason , we in the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left believe that it is crucial for the resolution on which the House will vote to commit the Commission and the Council to : 1 ) acknowledge the failure of the decision of 30 August 2003 ; 2 ) propose within the WTO to amend the TRIPS agreements and the new procedures for granting compulsory licences , which must be able to respond swiftly to health emergencies caused by the HIV epidemic ; 3 ) allocate EUR 1 billion to the Global Fund to fight AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , as was already requested by Parliament on 2 December 2004 and ignored by the Commission and the Council ; 4 ) dedicate more resources to research into medicines designed to treat diseases specifically affecting the south of the world and oblige the private sector , which has always benefited from public research , to set aside a reasonable amount of its own research for these neglected diseases .
It is up to us to channel our efforts into reversing this unacceptable situation , because failure to do so would be unjustifiable and indefensible .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( LT ) I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs , who have thoroughly studied and presented recommendations on one of today &apos;s most pressing social issues - the full integration into our society of people with disabilities .
Honourable Members , perhaps it is also appropriate to mention that 2007 is the Year of Equal Opportunities , which in my view provides a good opportunity to mobilise the Community .
We talk about producing better legislation , and the scope of such legislation is vast .
I really do want to encourage the Member States to take similar initiatives .
15 . Specific Programme &apos; People &apos; ( Seventh RTDD Framework Programme , 2007 @-@ 2013 ) ( vote )
The ambition to complete the longed @-@ for enlargement after the collapse of the Iron Curtain prevails over practical objections .
Galway , to continue to provide a world @-@ class platform for the development of marine science in Ireland and allow Ireland to play a more significant role internationally .
Today , Mr Cavada &apos;s resolution proposes that we go further in handing over powers to the European Union in the field of immigration policy , by abolishing the unanimity rule in the Council .
( PT ) I supported this excellent report , which offers a way for the EU to deal successfully with competition on the world market .
He is refusing to accept lawyers appointed by the tribunal , whom experience has shown to favour the prosecution .
I said to the European Council on several occasions on behalf of the European Parliament that every country should try to ratify the Treaty .
Those laws are a licence to kill , and the first public execution of a British citizen was carried out last month when Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned and died in London .
If I could change the name of the report , I would name it after them and all those who have worked with me .
The compromise that is now before us is , as I see it , the best compromise we could get after many long and difficult negotiations where extreme views were required to find the middle ground .
Please stop using the financial weakness of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises as a pretext !
I think that is going to be hard to explain to European citizens .
That is what this legislation will do .
Yes , I am dismayed , and what dismays me in particular is that the principle of substitution , where alternatives exist , has been weakened by the proposal for a substitution plan and a socio @-@ economic report , both of which will delay the replacement of dangerous substances .
Of course , I have sympathy for industry &apos;s view that replacement cannot be done overnight .
The attempts to extend the patent period , initially to 15 years and eventually to 12 , are detrimental to innovation as they strengthen the economic dominance of rich companies .
We are well aware that a scandal of that kind would be impossible with the text we are voting on today .
I heartily recommend the Sacconi package and congratulate him and all associated with it .
I believe that one of the most important elements of the agreement we have on the table , as Mrs Corbey underlined , is the substitution of the most dangerous substances with safer alternatives when these are available .
I am delighted , however , that our amendments have brought to light an abusive use of comitology procedures by the European Commission .
( EL ) Mr President , I consider the speech of the previous speaker quite useful and definitely well timed and I would like to endorse everything he said .
We need to think about that again in more detail when we consider the health programmes themselves .
This can only be done by taking action locally , and therefore such action should be regulated purely by means of subsidiarity . I should like to offer a rather exaggerated analogy .
Our secret hope is that the proposed amendments improve the implementation of the cofinanced programmes on the eradication of animal diseases .
The Commission is proposing to decouple aid from production , to implement the single payment system , and to abolish the compensatory aid scheme that contributed to price stability and safeguarded , albeit only partially , producers &apos; income .
I would like to point out that the banana sector in the outermost regions meets the non @-@ commercial criteria in force within the Union , unlike its competitors in Latin American countries .
I think that everyone agrees on this point , namely that irrespective of the opinions that each one of us has , this is not a suitable moment to discuss the full review of the legislation .
I am glad to say that the Commission has gone along with the idea that the programme should be country @-@ specific , rather than a general programme for 17 countries .
The specified thematic programmes include such programmes as investing in people , management of the environment and sustainable natural resources , including energy resources , participation of non @-@ governmental organisations and local government institutions in the development process , food security and migration , and asylum .
We have a common legal instrument , expiring in 2013 , and we have a mid @-@ term review .
As he said , this is an issue that has been gone over on a number of occasions , both within Parliament and internationally .
I have spoken a great deal with Mrs Klaß , whom I would like to thank at this point for her selfless efforts , about how important and significant this law is .
I should , of course , have liked the Member States to have been forced to take measures whenever a tendency to exceed the limit values is noted instead of once we have already damaged the groundwater irreparably .
Let me offer a word of advice to President Barroso as he chews on how to use the talents of his two latest recruits : there are not enough jobs for 27 Commissioners .
( Sustained applause )
If the regime accepts these proposals , Belarus will be able to receive considerable support for the launching of the political and socio @-@ economic reforms that have been so necessary for so long , and to begin a genuine rapprochement with Europe , including by means of gradual economic integration .
( The oral amendment was accepted )
Sweden , for example , has conducted a long and successful fight against salmonella within its own borders and is proof that the Member States themselves can engage in such battles without the need for funding by the European Union .
These agreements must be applied to the letter ; however , the promotion of the right to democracy cannot be a mere by @-@ product of policies on cooperation , international trade or humanitarian aid .
Thank you for your attention .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I , too , take the view that it is right to revise the television directive in view of the fact that the real world has changed so much ; revision of it is a response to the digitalisation of the media .
Product placement is on the whole prohibited , with exceptions that the Member States can authorise , but pressure at the eleventh hour has led the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe to table amendments that run counter to what had been accepted , and we object to this .
There must be regulations that create a balance when it comes to the quantity of advertisements permitted and to the particular consumer groups at which advertisements may be targeted .
In practice , mainstreaming has meant increasing interaction between human rights experts and national think @-@ tanks and presenting aspects of human rights in different EU areas of activity , such as crisis management and the export of arms .
I am pleased that there is a section devoted to the European Parliament this time .
However , I would ask the Presidency to recall the suggestion made by Parliament in my own report that a group of MEPs should become available for confidential consultation on those demarches in much the same way as for security issues .
We have been very clear .
I would like to say that today the discussion is very important as a final stage for Thursday &apos;s vote and I am very grateful to all who made this day happen .
In brief , the Member States have some effective democratic control over the way in which taxpayers &apos; money is used , while the EU institutions and this House have not .
Since many of the tasks it used to perform have been handed over to agencies , the Commission needs fewer staff , and I am waiting for it to produce very definite proposals as to how it is going to make Europe less bureaucratic , something that is not accomplished by what Commissioner Verheugen is doing , namely looking at laws , but by making cuts in personnel so that red tape is not generated in the first place .
The next item is Question Time ( B6 @-@ 0448 / 2006 ) .
Member of the Commission . I would like to point out that the important difference between the previous regulation and the present one which is based on the Montreal Convention is that passengers are entitled to receive direct and on @-@ the @-@ spot information , assistance and rerouting facilities , whereas the Montreal Convention only covers ad hoc claims to be presented in a court , as you rightly indicated , for possible damage caused because of a delay .
These actions are now almost completed .
Questions Nos 48 to 53 will be answered in writing .
The Commission has , from the outset , highlighted the importance to European citizens of this fund , which is a tangible expression of European solidarity .
Finally , we can decide on spending together with the Council .
I should like to stress in this House that this aid is intended directly for workers and that its primary aim is to get people back to work , which I feel is very positive .
The regulation that was adopted deals with this issue and at the same time we send out the message that the European Parliament cares about all European Union countries , equally .
This need was identified as long ago as 1999 .
Thank you very much for your contribution .
More demanding limit values have been set for vehicles with petrol engines than for diesel vehicles , since it is easier and costs less to achieve lower emissions with petrol engines than is the case with diesel engines .
I have been here in the Chair since 9 p.m. I am being fortified by coffee and some nameless Portuguese firewater provided by the usher , because it is Christmas .
It is the only solution capable of resolving the ever more serious problem of managing air quality in our cities .
All these things have to be sorted out if the project is to be proceeded with in a serious way .
The two reports before us today are a valuable contribution to this debate .
In fact , it is said to be the main reason for the &apos; no &apos; votes in France and the Netherlands .
It is every country that wishes to accede to the European Union that must adapt .
It is the work of the occupying army .
Mr Stubb will not be surprised to know that the UK Independence Party does not agree with that , but I have found something in his report that we can agree with .
Yet Mr Méndez de Vigo said that there should be no future enlargements without the Constitutional Treaty .
The European Union policy cannot be one where we just expand and expand the whole time , and when there are problems we create new agencies .
I am thinking , in particular , of the review of the Union &apos;s financing system .
If today we have twenty @-@ seven Commissioners deciding on the scope of their portfolios , then perhaps it might be sensible to appoint two or three Commissioners who would be responsible for analysing the situation in the European Union and preparing the reform programme in such a way as to ensure that we are capable of further enlargement .
That , Mr President , promptly brings me to my second point , which is to ask just what has emerged from the trilogue .
( The oral amendment was adopted )
Despite these considerable defects , I have voted in favour of the compromise , since it also bears the stamp of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , the opinion of which I drafted , and on the grounds that the new directive creates Europe @-@ wide legal certainty by replacing forty individual regulations , considerably improves information on 30 000 substances , and reduces to a minimum the safety risks for consumers and workers in the chemical industry .
( DE ) Mr President , the basic idea of ensuring that , in certain cases , materials that give a great deal of cause for concern are replaced by materials or technologies that are less hazardous , provided that economically suitable and technically feasible alternatives are available , is a good one , although , in doing this , particular attention needs to be given to this regulation &apos;s potential effects on small and medium @-@ sized businesses and on the jobs they provide .
A compromise was agreed on , but this compromise was not supported by seven countries , including Sweden .
It would be less costly for it to compromise these policies for the benefit of European businesses and employees .
The new , so @-@ called Euro 5 standard will specifically focus on particles and on nitrogen oxide ( NOx ) , which is emitted by vehicles fitted with diesel engines .
As I do not know whether I will again have the honour to speak when you are in the chair , I would like to thank you for exercising the office of Vice @-@ President in such an outstanding way .
Firstly , because it is the people of the Member States who are most affected by the economic and social consequences of enlargement and who therefore deserve to be heard .
We hope , moreover , for improved transatlantic cooperation and have faith in Commissioner Frattini &apos;s commitment in this regard .
Mr President , I assume that you wanted me to comment on this , even though we actually have Council question time in two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours &apos; time this afternoon .
At the Foreign Ministers &apos; dinner , to be held in conjunction with the European Council tomorrow evening , the discussion will centre on the Middle East , including Iran , and Africa , in particular the situation in Sudan and Darfur .
It is for that reason that what the Commission has proposed to do about this , which the foreign ministers have accepted , shows such a high degree of responsibility and has resulted in a sound compromise .
Did we supply those ships ?
I just wish to repeat what my dear friend and colleague the Chairman of the Socialist Group presented to you as an offer that you cannot refuse - a Sicilian offer .
Turkey was not ready for political solutions .
On making the EU more effective in law enforcement , the draft European Council conclusions are an exercise in contortion .
We will have to wait and see .
If you get that through , I think it would be very good .
During the Finnish Presidency the Commission forwarded a communication on children &apos;s rights .
As for the debate we had earlier today on the US ATS , as I mentioned and as I understand it , this was referred to in September 2005 in papers which were also sent to the European Parliament , but this was never before such a major issue .
The Member States thus have the competence to regulate on this and ensure compliance in their territory with the laws that they pass .
So let us make sure the Member States build the information network quickly .
We are trying to prevent driving licence tourism , and I can only add my support to those who have called on the Commission to pin the nation states down on this as quickly as possible .
I for one would never let a child of mine of that age have access to one .
I should like to thank Mr Le Rachinel and the Committee on Transport and Tourism for having supported it .
It is a necessary requirement , however ; one cannot be in the Schengen area without being in the Schengen Information System .
To conclude , following on from the child protection strategy that we launched in July , I intend to refer this problem to the European Forum for the Rights of the Child .
The sun went down long ago , but this debate is taking place before the European public . Parliament , which screams for transparency and presses the Council and the Commission to take citizens and their cares seriously , is discussing its own affairs late at night , and then after long squabbles and only when forced to do so by the small parties .
The effects of that were felt throughout the European Union .
It is imperative that we end the requirement for separation of energy producers and energy transport networks and that we halt all further attempts to liberalise the energy sector .
A prosperous , competitive and sustainable future for Europe will require a major shift in energy policy .
I believe the EU as a whole is being very naive in the way it is dealing with the subject of energy .
I call on the Commission to fulfil its obligations and take action accordingly .
We will constantly need to question the Commission on the enforcement of European rules .
All those who had the opportunity to know her admired her energy , her courage to the end , Mr President .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I applied to speak for two minutes but will not need that long .
The June List champions the sovereignty of the nation state with regard to legal issues .
I believe that this new single EU @-@ wide credit card format will also go a long way in combating driving licence tourism .
We wholeheartedly support her , and the fact that we did not express it on this occasion is a technical - I could use a ruder word - mistake for which , I am afraid , a number of us probably bear responsibility .
I invite my colleagues to condemn the use of force in Fiji , not to recognise the usurpers of power , and to support the opposition &apos;s invitation to the people of the country to oppose the revolution through peaceful demonstrations .
The military takeover is a clear violation of Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement and the essential parts of it concerning human rights , democracy and the rule of law .
I would also like to underline that there should be a proportionate participation by women in UN peacekeeping missions .
Also worthy of condemnation are the acts of aggression and forced displacement of ethnic minorities that have affected more than eighty thousand people this year alone .
The aim of the REACH Regulation is to guarantee high standards of health and environmental protection and boost the competitiveness of the EU &apos;s chemicals industry through the use of high standards of safety and by promoting product development .
They are entitled to expect more effective collaboration in improving security and combating crime .
It works through a constructive exchange between a unique mix of institutions producing , hopefully , a win @-@ win situation for everybody .
There is even common ground with Mr Bonde on the issue of transparency , although I should like to add that there are few other issues of which this can be said .
The European Parliament needs an ideological majority rather than a große Koalition .
( Laughter )
I will mention the Services Directive , REACH , etc .
Mr President , I want to welcome the Summit Conclusions on immigration .
Once again , I would like to thank Parliament for its support .
( DE ) Mr President , I rise to speak further to Rule 29 of the Rules of Procedure of this House , according to which it is a fundamental requirement , where a political parliamentary group is to be formed , that those who are to be its members share a political affinity .
But I have not been working alone .
We are all aware that this was a particularly tough task that you had to accomplish .
Admittedly , we did not change the face of the world with our unanimous resolution , but we at least , thanks to you , saved Europe &apos;s honour .
Therefore , please go local and talk to your constituents , listen to your citizens and show them how you can take their views and concerns into account .
There is a trend , now prevalent , for administration to take on more of a political colour and for posts to be openly shared out between the European People &apos;s Party and the Socialists ; this is downgrading many of our officials and will weaken our institutions . It must be reversed .
My intention in so doing is to express the truth that , wherever we may stand politically , and by whatever convictions and ideals we may be guided , we are bound by the determined will to make , whilst retaining the identities of our peoples , the European Union an ever @-@ closer union of peoples of the kind prescribed by the Treaties .
Your election did not come as a great surprise , as we have known what the result would be since 2004 .
( The sitting was suspended at 3.25 p.m. and resumed at 6.00 p.m. )
I would like firstly to say that this is an exemplary issue , an extremely unusual one , because we are talking about the transposition into Community law of a sectoral social agreement , in this case a prior agreement between the European rail companies and rail employees .
The Council and Parliament have , in the past , often proven their good faith and achieved mutually acceptable compromises from mutually opposing positions .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is entirely in favour of opening up international services to the market , as the Commission proposed , as did the Council in its common position , but we also want other national services to be liberalised and for that to be included in this amendment of Directive 91 / 440 / EEC that we are debating .
In my constituency of Northern Ireland , we benefited from essential improvements on the north @-@ south rail connection from Larne through to the border with the Irish Republic and on to Dublin .
Anyone who knows Mr Jarzembowski will know that he always likes to make sure his proposals are not boring .
The Sterckx report concerns passengers &apos; rights and obligations .
If we had done that , I would have been able to say with certainty that everybody here is in favour of progress on Europe &apos;s railways .
I would like to thank all of the Members .
This demonstrates the spirit of the compensatory inequalities of the CNUCED .
This sum can be compared to the EUR 22.7 billion proposed by the Luxembourg Presidency .
The evaluation of the ways in which the committees have so far complied with Parliament &apos;s decision that the gender equality perspective should always permeate our work shows , unsurprisingly , that there is still an incredible amount to be done before we can say that the equality perspective really has been integrated into our work .
I have in mind , for example , quotas for involvement in public life .
Parliament will never obtain integrated committees , half of whose committee draftsmen or chairmen are women , until half the Members of the European Parliament are women .
I want to underline what Mrs Wallis has already said .
Communication of Council common positions : see Minutes
Taking as its basis the guidelines for the EU &apos;s policy in respect of third states and the death penalty as adopted in 1998 by its Council of Ministers , the European Union is campaigning worldwide for the abolition of the death penalty under all circumstances , and the declaration of moratoria has for some years been a consistent feature of that campaign - albeit not as its main objective , but as an intermediate stage on the way to the practice &apos;s abolition once and for all .
Against this backdrop and ahead of the developing world congress &#91; against the death penalty &#93; , the EU must be extra vigilant .
At such times , people &apos;s emotions incline them to desire a very different outcome .
We need greater political ownership of this debate .
We have to remember that nuclear energy cannot be the answer to this problem , especially if we want Europe to be a self @-@ sufficient energy economy .
Finally , I would like to point to the importance of promoting renewable energy sources and clean forms of transport and say that it is urgent that we discuss seriously the issue of nuclear energy once and for all .
The scientific and economic arguments in favour of taking ambitious , global action to address climate change are obvious and incontrovertible .
Let me conclude by mentioning two areas in which we are a long way away from achieving any real breakthrough .
Whether data obtained from SWIFT have been fed into this system is one of the questions currently being examined .
This second issue is even more delicate and it concerns the American authorities &apos; access to data relating to financial transfers .
There is , however , a limit to the level of blackmail we are willing to accept .
We began by discussing airline passenger data , and now we come on to SWIFT .
In any global framework for exchange of mass commercial data for security purposes , the EU must forcefully project its own laws and principles .
It is a matter , however , of overcoming the obstacle that Parliament cannot be informed if classified material is involved . I shall keep you up to date on this .
This is not helpful for the protection of the injured parties , who are often unaware of the variations in limitation periods in various countries and submit claims for damages to foreign courts after the expiry of the relevant period .
They have a difficult balancing act to perform between tradition and the pressures of modernity .
In fact , in this case , in the Gabon agreement , the fisheries sector is going to pay almost 20 % more than the European Union pays from the Community budget .
Let me make perfectly plain something that was not a bone of contention in our deliberations , namely that nobody is seeking to restrict workers &apos; rights in any way whatever .
That business now has branches in Hong Kong , Jersey , the Channel Islands and South Africa , as well as London and York , which is my constituency .
All too often , company founders are reluctant to do business because they do not understand the legal environment very well , particularly when they establish themselves in another Member State .
Finally , can the Commissioner ensure that Parliament will be kept informed ?
It could also mean fair prices - which is not unimportant given that public service contracts involve taxpayers &apos; money - with the right , though , to include social and environmental criteria at the tendering stage .
( Applause )
Yes , the European Parliament was right to denounce this disgraceful situation .
( SV ) We do not believe that the assessment of what may be referred to as chronic obesity is a political issue . That needs to be a task for medical science .
It is important that any new legislation in this area is based on sound evidence , not least to ensure that any future law brings forward specific and focused measures to tackle the problems .
Both are workable options .
The plan is for it to go right through a Natura 2000 area in one of Europe &apos;s genuinely unique areas of natural beauty .
The Portuguese people voted in favour of the proposal .
This instrument must serve to exploit as far as possible the benefits and possibilities that the globalisation of data and services offer to governments , to private enterprise , to universities , to society as a whole and , most importantly , to the citizens .
That is why I am repeating my call to Mr Erdogan from this Chamber .
It is the task of the Turkish Government to find suitable instruments for solving this shameful problem and for gradually phasing it out .
I extend a very warm welcome to all of you .
Does it reduce red tape and costs ?
It is for that reason that the German EU Presidency , together with the Commission , Parliament and the Member States , will do everything in its power to set a timetable for completing this project so that people in 2009 know what kind of Europe they are voting for and how this Europe will be able to act in future .
As I often say , we cannot build tomorrow &apos;s Europe with yesterday &apos;s tools .
And quite right too !
In this context , Mr President , the contribution of our institution to resolving the constitutional deadlock must not simply be - as you said , repeating word for word , and surely not by coincidence , what Mrs Merkel said to us - &apos; saving the substance of the Constitution &apos; .
In your speech , you mentioned several important features of our European tradition , and four in particular : Greek philosophy , Roman law , Judaeo @-@ Christian spirituality and the Enlightenment .
It is important , on the other hand , to issue an opinion on the process of which this forms part , namely the &apos; better lawmaking &apos; initiative , which , under the guise of simplification , is in practice a policy of market deregulation at national and Community level .
We also express our disagreement with the principle of &apos; the polluter pays &apos; and the principle of the &apos; waste generator &apos;s responsibility &apos; , as they are tools for shifting blame from the polluter , who can basically pollute with impunity and just pay a financial price .
Although your House is not directly involved in these preparatory activities , I am able to assure you that the Presidency will be taking account of the opinions you have adopted in connection with the themes of the Summit .
This is also why all our attention is focused on training , education , lifelong learning , the fight against exclusion and sound migration policy and indeed , gender equality , for the fact that talented women opt out is also a form of brain drain .
We are talking about better regulation and about energy and climate change , but not in any way about the now long overdue beginning of a socio @-@ environmental reconstruction that really would counteract the social division and climate @-@ related catastrophe about the latter of which everyone is currently talking .
The second reason why a working single energy market is important is the competitiveness of our enterprises , particularly on the production side .
The current Lisbon policy mix is seriously unbalanced .
I wish the Commissioner and the European Commission success in this action , and also in the area of information .
On action and energy , we have to fulfil existing agreements on energy liberalisation .
It is true that two other Member States have voted against it , but , at the same time - as the German Chancellor said in her speech on the German Presidency here a few weeks ago - many people who reject this Constitutional Treaty also want the European Union to have more powers and responsibilities , for example in the field of energy .
I shall make a few initial observations tonight based on our first reading of the report .
I think we need to be careful to avoid the character of our wines becoming globalised .
This is the road that we need to go down , not that of changing wine into an ordinary industrial product .
Where we disagree with the Commissioner is that we do not wish to give as much weight to grubbing @-@ up , as all parties are in agreement that changes in structure and modernisation are at least as important as grubbing @-@ up .
At the same time , Mrs Batzeli &apos;s report constitutes a clear stand by the European Parliament in light of the new common organisation of the wine market planned by the Commission and sets caution and logic against what are in my view the Commission &apos;s hasty and simplified initial thoughts .
The urgency of the matter can be summed up in the word &apos; convergence &apos; .
( Voting time was suspended at 12 noon to make way for the formal sitting , and resumed at 12.30 p.m. )
Nor can the Europe of projects or results be put forward today as an alternative vision and strategy .
The Legal Service of the European Parliament , with which I have consulted on this issue , has informed me that , in our specific case , the last sentence of Rule 52 ( 4 ) has to be applied mutatis mutandis , which means that we have the vote on this legislative resolution and that a second referral to committee according to Rule 52 ( 3 ) is not appropriate , so we are not referring it back to committee .
It is for this reason that the EPLP voted against amendment 29 .
We therefore urge the Commission to recast the proposal in order to ensure that a decision on this issue does not ultimately lead to the renationalisation of the costs of the CAP .
The conclusion is that the EU of capital and its political spokesmen are destroying the planet on the pretext of environmental changes and their only concern is how to make more profitable use of the Kyoto &apos; market mechanisms &apos; .
Merely because of these two options , I decided , contrary to my convictions , to vote against this resolution .
The Commission welcomes the interest of the Parliament on the external aspects of the fight against terrorism .
It also appears to me that whole subjects have been left out completely - state @-@ sponsored terrorism , for example .
The public &apos;s right to security is , of course , one of the fundamental freedoms , but how can that security be guaranteed ?
They will remain , I think , as landmark , sectoral agreements within the overall new architecture provided by the strategic agreement on which we hope to launch negotiations with Russia soon .
The Commission and the Council have put forward a declaration that is partially in keeping with Parliament &apos;s wishes .
The European Parliament needs to be consulted before the conclusion of the agreement , as laid down in paragraph 3 of that article .
The results we are seeing demonstrate clearly that that is not the case .
I have learnt a second lesson from this , which is that not only has this formula been ineffective , but it is wrong to think that Europe will cope if it practices downwards competition .
( EL ) Mr President , I have read both reports by my honourable friends with interest and would like to comment on three numbers : 8 , 17 and 12 500
How can new fields be developed in this regard ?
A few years ago , in the course of various debates in Europe , &apos; best practices &apos; were discussed - that is , looking at what one &apos;s neighbours are doing successfully - and this concept could certainly be transferred to certain African countries .
No one doubts the Council &apos;s determination on the question of the emissions trading scheme .
I should like to emphasise once more , however , that , where there is budgetary control , this is not necessarily a matter of a request by the Court of Auditors , but rather of the following question . How can we make the rules , including budgetary rules , more efficient , more transparent , more uniform , so that the necessary control can be achieved ?
However , the most notable absentee is the Council , and in the meantime , I am afraid to say , people continue to die in Darfur .
Two and a half million people have had to flee their homes .
As the main market and importer of fisheries products from all parts of the world , the Community has a special responsibility in terms of guaranteeing that products that end up on the tables of European consumers do not originate from illegal activities .
It is unacceptable that the amount of illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing of bluefin tuna , which is the species that has been the subject of most analysis in this connection , is 50 % greater than the amount fished legally .
We now also know that this atypical tendency to migration among European Roma is in fact caused by the segregation in schools , the enormous unemployment rate , very strong prejudice , and limited access to health care services which they suffer in their home countries .
The compromise package that is now on the table contains very effective solutions to the problems that we have identified , without imposing excessive burdens .
This is the exact point we are making .
Half a century , with mixed results .
The European winemaking sector is in a difficult situation , facing fierce competition from wine from the New World .
The report does acknowledge that over the past six years , since the introduction of the euro and the Lisbon Strategy , there has been weak economic growth , stagnation and even recession in some Member States , including Portugal .
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolutions on the dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Envoys of the Dalai Lama .
In this regard , I believe that it is the Chinese Government that should show greater signs of willingness and at least accept a resumption of dialogue with a view to reaching a good final agreement .
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Red Cross efforts are severely underfunded .
I am delighted the German Ombudsman is with us today .
This was the reason for the strikes and demonstrations that took place in 2005 and also at the start of this year , protesting against the corrupt rule of Lasana Conté who has been in power for 23 years .
If we are to fight it effectively , we need to go beyond mere close cooperation and develop a coherent common policy that meets the needs of the public while also reflecting our understanding of human rights and human dignity .
In this vote , the European Parliament will draw attention to the limitations of voluntary CSR reporting and of social auditing as it exists today .
In my view this mode of behaviour does not meet our expectations regarding corporate social responsibility .
( PL ) Mr President , I am aware that the concept of corporate social responsibility is becoming an increasingly important part of the debate on globalisation , competitiveness and sustainable development .
I believe that this issue should be placed in the front line of the debate .
I believe that increased but also controlled competition in the area of collective management of copyright and related rights in the music sector on the Internet may prove beneficial to all .
Nonetheless , it is essential for the Commission to undertake an in depth study of this problem .
I am glad that it was possible to agree on criteria and deadlines , but I have my misgivings about the role played in the debate by the supervisory bodies , who , back in the days of the &apos; Basel II &apos; debate , had not done very much to clarify how they were supposed to monitor the integration of financial markets .
In the communication we described and analysed all the problems and issues , which are complicated .
Mr President , I would like to thank Members for a very interesting debate , which will be very useful and will provide guidance for us in the next steps of drafting a proposal , along with the outcome of contributions from the other stakeholders , from consultations and from the Member States .
Parliament and the Council adopted the directive on concentrations of capital .
We are making good progress in partnership with the Member States .
We still want stronger leadership , however .
It seems to us that they have not been incorporated and that is a problem , Commissioner , because we always find ourselves in the same situation : Parliament draws up a series of guidelines that should be taken into account in the next budgetary procedure , you lay out your political priorities in this annual political strategy document , you add a budgetary component , but you do not take any notice , or at least you do not take sufficient notice , of everything Parliament asked for the year before .
Policy strategy is not just about new initiatives .
It is going to create another two separate agencies in addition to the previous ones and the European Institute of Technology besides .
Indeed , Vice @-@ President Barrot plans to present a White Paper on urban transport .
We have to engage at all levels and this is of course the intention of our communication policy as well .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this debate is indeed very timely , for the negotiations have just been completed , and the Transport Council will be delivering its verdict next week .
On the one hand , I think it is good that flying becomes more affordable and that there will be more flights available .
( ES ) Madam President , good relations between the United States and the European Union are crucial to both sides of the Atlantic , although some people would prefer that not to be the case .
Repeal of this regulation will improve the quality of Community legislation .
We do not believe that the EU should express opinions on issues of this type in far @-@ reaching reports resembling political programmes more than anything else , and we object in principle to the general trend whereby the EU institutions endeavour to achieve influence and competence within ever more areas .
The next item is Council and Commission statements on non @-@ proliferation and nuclear disarmament .
This is something I deeply regret .
What moral authority can the UK Government possibly think it has to lecture countries like Iran about not developing nuclear weapons , when we ourselves continue to do exactly that ?
The most important four principles we should try to enhance again at the Preparatory Committee and then at the next review conference are as follows .

Therefore , I ask Member States and the Commission to work together and to commit to achieving these targets .
In particular I asked for a system of penalties to be introduced in the event of failure to respect the rules , and I proposed amendments to include within the scope of the regulation meat @-@ based products intended for human consumption , prepared , processed or cooked products .
In its proposal , the Commission anticipates the principle of authorisation to ratify and suggests 31 December 2008 as the target date for depositing the instruments of ratification .
It has been said , if the European Union and the European Free Trade Association ratify it , then the Convention will come into effect and will apply everywhere .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( MT ) I would like to begin by reminding everybody present in this House , and in particular the Commissioner , that , during the negotiations between Malta and the European Union , the European Commission recognised in writing that , following accession to the European Union , Malta would make use of a derogation to allow spring hunting .
There is no agreement on anything else .
Allow me to say a few words by way of conclusion . The 50th anniversary represents an opportunity for us all to build up strength for the challenges that lie ahead .
The next 50 years will , however , be full of fresh challenges for all our countries .
This is often forgotten , and I shall come back to it .
Mr De Rossa , that was not a point of order , but it will be noted nonetheless .
The European internal market must be developed and completed in important fields : once again , I give the examples of gas and electricity , postal services - and also financial markets .
( Applause )
We are grateful to the German Presidency for the success of this summit .
So , Chancellor Merkel thinks EU citizens can be bypassed and hoodwinked : if the title &apos; Constitution &apos; is dropped , then we can avoid even asking the electorate .

The conclusions therefore mention the need not only to create more jobs and to sustain growth , but also to safeguard the quality of jobs , working conditions , worker participation and the reconciling of professional and family life .
We still have to prove ourselves both internally and internationally .
Now of course the same questions are being asked about 25 March .
I therefore particularly welcome the fact that our Heads of State or Government have now also finally managed to reach such a decision .
( SV ) Common rules governing air transport are necessary and desirable , especially from a safety point of view .
Paragraph 6 of this report on social services of general interest points out &apos; the Member State authorities &apos; freedom to define , organise and finance social services of general interest as they see fit &apos; , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
As the USA becomes ever more military in its focus , it threatens other sovereign countries with its interference and military aggression .
Thank you very much for your attention .
The aim is to revitalise it in order to provide a parliamentary dimension to dialogue and cooperation in the Mediterranean .
We must implement the Barcelona + 10 conclusions and ensure that the European neighbourhood policy does not push aside the Barcelona Process .
Therefore , we need further to strengthen cooperation and economic integration , and then the other things will follow almost automatically .
The European aerospace industry is a world leader in several important market segments ; it has in excess of a one @-@ third share in the global market .
I think we should go for new success and give the company better opportunities by letting it be independent and not involved in political decision @-@ making .
I can in fact do no more than repeat that the actual step we intend to take on 19 April - that being the submission of a revised draft of the framework decision - is an important step forwards .
The progress made by the candidate country continues to dictate the tempo of the accession negotiations .
Are they not the key to this matter ?
These changes challenge traditional understanding of what constitutes EU production and the EU &apos;s economic interests .
Thirdly , the European Commission is very cautious in applying so @-@ called protective clauses whose aim is to prevent the European Union market from being suddenly flooded by a particular type of product .
Member of the Commission .
They cannot be circumvented or overriden .
In that field , we have been able to implement a rationalisation process for our 27 Member States and 500 million citizens and ensure that , rather than 27 different regulations , a single one applies , which was adopted through constructive cooperation .
The Association Agreement must gradually liberalise trade and develop political relations , whilst simultaneously promoting democracy and the social and cultural rights characteristic of the region .
The fight against poverty and social inequality can become a very useful tool in strengthening democracy , establishing trust in public institutions and also in the political elite , that ought to be the guardian of these values .
The issue of missing persons in Cyprus is part of the shared past that the two communities are now attempting to understand and to overcome .
This report is therefore devoting the appropriate consideration to them .
It is about time we all calmed down and realised that minimal global warming is naturally occurring in a cycle that has no input from man .
In these areas the ability to react positively to economic change is limited and island economies tend to be hardest hit by economic crises .
Tourism represents one of the primary sources of wealth creation in islands with spin offs on other sectors - fisheries , agriculture , crafts .
It was silent on the unacceptable , wait @-@ and @-@ see and follow @-@ my @-@ leader attitude of the EU , which still continues to make the re @-@ establishment of relations with the Palestinian authorities , including the recommencement of financial support , dependent on their meeting certain conditions such as the &apos; commitment to non @-@ violence &apos; , when it is Israel that is occupying Palestinian territories militarily ; or the &apos; recognition of Israel &apos; , when it is Israel that does not recognise the right of the Palestinian people to its sovereign and independent state ; and &apos; respect for previous agreements and obligations , including the Road Map &apos; , when it is Israel that does not comply with the United Nations resolutions , the Oslo Accords and the Road Map itself and is continuing with its construction of the illegal wall and the policy of settlements .
This breed of European politicians is prepared to do anything to impose its vision of Europe and to do so against the wishes of the people , if necessary .
It is a policy that sidesteps and fails to tackle the underlying causes of immigration , which have been identified for a long time , particularly by the United Nations .
The seal hunters used violence to try to prevent me from seeing what was going on .
If a government has for several years been unable or unwilling to guarantee the basic right to life and security for all its citizens and to bring contract killers to justice , then such a government necessarily undermines its own position as a credible international partner .
Since then , the country has still not found rest , despite a degree of democratisation in the last 20 years .
The debate is closed .
Because we want to consider these points as a whole , we prefer to vote for our own resolution and not for the joint text .
The debate is closed .
The reason why that is so important is that we do , of course , know that Europe can lead the way in this area only if it can set itself ambitious targets .
There is no doubt that the failure of the ratification process of the Constitutional Treaty leaves a permanent shadow of doubt hanging over the European Union .
Territorial integration has enabled us to put a stop to the ambitions of those who would be Great Powers ; a combination of economic progress and social security has made social exclusion a thing of the past , and the concept of integration has defeated ethnic , religious and cultural intolerance , yet the things I have described are still there , for hatred , exclusion , oppression and even the striving to dominate others have now returned to our Union , not only in Eastern Europe , but throughout it .
As Pope Benedict XVI himself has commented , it even manages to gloss over the Christian roots of Europe ; was that what the agreement of a Christian Democrat President of this House and a Christian Democrat President of the Council was needed for ?
Europe has provided a forum where democratically elected governments can take decisions based on dialogue .
What has become clear here today - and I am sure that this reflects opinion in all of your groups - is that the common mind and will of the overwhelming majority in your House is that this Europe of ours be moved forward , and , moreover with a dose of optimism thrown in , of the kind referred to by the chairman of the Socialist Group , Mr Schulz , whom I , too - on the assumption that I , in my capacity as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , am allowed to do so - want to praise today , for that the situation is historic , and a very serious one , is a point on which I agree entirely with all those who have made it today .
Let us come down to reality .
What is equally important , however , is that the efficiency of financial supervision be enhanced without encumbering the financial sector with an excessive supervisory burden or restricting competition .
The reaction to a crisis such as this one is becoming increasingly complex because of the large number of institutions involved and the lack of clarity about what their role consists of .
Thirdly , the preparatory work focuses on defining the prospect of Kosovo &apos;s EU membership and on support for its economic and social development .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - Madam President , I would like to join my colleagues in thanking the rapporteur for the work carried out on this report .
Whether that can be just , my dear Mr Tabajdi , I do not know .
As a Member of the European Parliament , I very much regret that we have driven Serbia into a situation where it has to rely on Russia and is looking to play Russia as an ace in defending Serbia &apos;s interests in the UN Security Council .
On the subject of genetically modified organisms , we are absolutely set on confirming to consumers that organic farming does not contain any GMOs , from seed to distribution .
If organic production rules are circumvented , then these imported products would not be organic - meaning that we would be deceiving consumers - and would be competing with European farmers who comply with all the terms and conditions .
Reducing paper consumption and using air @-@ conditioning more rationally would produce both gains from the environmental viewpoint and also significant savings in the European Parliament &apos;s budget .
The Commission will continue to support employers &apos; and employees &apos; organisations in the whole sport sector and it will continue its open dialogue with all sport organisations on this issue .
I would therefore ask the Commission whether it shares my view that we leave amateur sports out of the equation , but that professional sport is an entertainment industry which should probably even fall within the Services Directive , and that an internal market should probably eventually be created for these services , for this entertainment industry .
Amendment 25 , until it was sensibly withdrawn , ordered the flying of the EU flag at Champions League and European Championship matches .
I should also like to stress another point : in this area we are lucky to have a trusted partner in UEFA .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m .
Then there are two other conventions : one on the protection of people abandoned at sea - you will have heard about these crazy situations in which sailors cannot leave their vessel after the shipowner has gone bankrupt and who remain berthed for months on end - and one on liability for damage produced by bunker oil , otherwise known as degassing .
However , it is true that , thanks to the Community , we can promote within the IMO an approach aimed at having the international standards applied more effectively by all of the flag States .
Firstly , I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Members of the Commission for their cooperation and the three presidencies involved in this codecision procedure , namely the Austrian , Finnish and German , for their close collaboration .

I will do this in English so that Mr Mikolášik will understand me directly .
It is extremely important that issues as sensitive and complex as this are dealt with under the codecision procedure .
It is urgently required , it will be of great benefit and there is no reason for delaying its implementation by loading it with unnecessary ethical provisos and carve @-@ outs that are impossible to agree with the Council .
The Commission is , however , unhappy about a number of points that have emerged from the debate , firstly about Parliament &apos;s desire to limit the scope of the directive solely to the ambit of the Community &apos;s powers , and I have to say that that will result in serious difficulties when it comes to transposing the directive .
Moreover , on copyright matters the directive abandons the concept of commercial scale and is liable to criminalise private , not @-@ for @-@ profit use by people who use the Internet for peer @-@ to @-@ peer file sharing , video streaming and so forth .
I say that with the greatest of respect for all of those who have been directly involved in drawing it up .
We have emphasised a number of policies in particular , for example the neighbourhood policy towards eastern and southern countries , a policy that must also serve to promote democracy and human rights there .
More specifically : it is still very hard for citizens to understand who in the Commission is doing what with how much money .
I am proud to present the report on this regulation for the second time .
Mrs Fisher Boel , the quality of Polish starch products is high , and they can therefore compete on the external market .
The current starch quota allocation most certainly classes as a mistake .
This example , though , demonstrated once again that the fines that are then levied are first fed to the European Commission before they are channelled back to the Member States , and do not end up directly with these consumers .
Decision on urgent procedure
I should like to finish off by saying that the two amendments tabled by Mr Fjellner and others enjoy my full support .
First , as regards the Integrated Administration and Control System ( IACS ) in Greece and agricultural subsidies , a very clear action plan has now been agreed with Greece in order to ensure proper implementation of the IACS in that country .
Various unacceptable anomalies have been found in the tendering and contracting procedures and we must demand a substantial improvement in these processes .
On the other hand , it has to be said that the Martha Andreasen case has not resulted in a situation where the chief accountant in the Commission would approve the authenticity of the accounts with her signature .
But perhaps the Commission has a point and this line of thinking has persuaded the governments of the UK , Sweden and the Netherlands to agree to declarations about the future management of EU funds - for what that is worth .
Why is it not here when we are talking about how the Council spends 90 % of our budget ?
Today , Parliament is being asked to vote on my report on combating HIV / AIDS within the European Union and in the neighbouring countries , 2006 @-@ 2009 , which contains many important suggestions on how to combat the disease .
Mr President , in order to cure HIV / AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries we need an integrated strategy that will promote prevention on a community level as well as in these countries , but also , I would say , on a worldwide scale .
The fact that it is mainly the most vulnerable groups in society that are affected by HIV and the spread of infection shows that we need to work in new ways if we are genuinely to reach all social groups .
- Report : Graefe zu Baringdorf
- Before the vote on paragraph 77 :
It is unconscionable to hand out privileges to other countries at the expense of Lithuanian starch production capacity and agricultural producers in general .
This is a step towards satisfying the emergency needs of capitalism .
The responsibility for the treatment of HIV / AIDS does not lie in the hands of one and joining forces with corporations will not prove effective , because they are only interested in making profit .
We would like the Galileo project also to be compatible and interoperable with the conventional navigation systems , such as the GSM , and others .
It seems to be common practice that codecision legislative proposals are discussed when the fewest MEPs and members of the public are present , and that is wrong .
As he said in his introduction , we all want to travel safely and securely .
That is only right and proper , for we must be seen to respond to public concerns .
Population growth and the accompanying increase in the number of economic assets in these areas give rise to higher risks and more costly damage .
It is evident that the way in which we use our natural resources constitutes a threat towards our ecosystems on which our quality of life and prosperity depend .
We have to recognise that we have a worldwide water crisis , especially as regards drinking water , as well as global warming , and a threat to biodiversity , where Europe &apos;s ecological footprint is twice as big as its biological capacity , and every year people are dying of diseases caused by a polluted environment .
It is only if we are able to harness the influence , experience and potential of Europe and America , and to mobilise their best forces and ideas , that we will be able to find viable responses for our common future and the future of subsequent generations .
Our message to them must be that it is time for him to go .
However , it would be worthwhile to step up our dialogue with our American friends and colleagues and to insist on backing the Palestinian unity government .
This is a government that is friends with Hezbollah and talks to Hamas , not to mention the support it gives to Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales , or the dubious negotiations it conducted with the Taliban to secure the release of a journalist .
Let us completely open our markets to each other and to technology exchange .
The Commission has been unstinting in its endeavours towards securing the closer involvement of the legislative institutions in trans @-@ Atlantic relations , and it was the Commission , in particular , that set in motion the trans @-@ Atlantic dialogue between them .
It must also continue with its efforts to fulfil the political and economic criteria .
However , Zagreb must now reaffirm its determination to implement its obligations concerning the reform of the judiciary , the introduction of a non @-@ discriminatory market economy , the protection of ethnic minorities and the return of refugees and displaced persons .
What I imagine will happen is that the Conference of Presidents will have to debate this issue and that the Committee on Legal Affairs , precisely in the terms stated by Mr Gargani , will be very keen to ensure that Parliament &apos;s independence is respected , and I therefore consider this debate now closed .
We have not been informed by the Council that COREPER has accepted this package .
Explanations of vote
Mr President , I have voted in favour of what , for the sake of convenience , I will refer to as the package of the trialogue .
Would a busker fall within this scope ?
The United States administration is responsible for serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Afghanistan , Iraq and Guantánamo and for illegal detentions and renditions in the case of the CIA flights .
It is of the utmost importance in terms of the further entrenchment of democratic conditions in that country and of the continuity of its reform process that a solution be found to the present crisis .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , as I see it , the future of the European Union and that of Ukraine are politically intertwined .
The topic falls within the remit of the European Union .
It is a fact , though , that we discussed the problems in Poland one and a half years ago and that they are still there today .
The attempt being made here to convince the world and Europe that Poland is a hotbed of intolerance towards homosexuals is a huge obscenity and political slander , a cynical ploy to delude public opinion in Europe .
In order to increase the effectiveness of the investigation and prosecution by law enforcement authorities of persons who have committed genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , the Council adopted Decision 2002 / 494 / JHA on setting up a network of contact points on genocide and Decision 2003 / 335 / JHA on the investigation and prosecution of serious international crimes .
( DE ) This matter is still being discussed at present .
What is the Council &apos;s assessment of the Arroyo government &apos;s evident failure to act and reports that the Philippines army is behind these killings ?
Questions which had not been answered for lack of time would receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
That demonstrates his ability to mediate with the political groups , the Council and the Commission .
Conservative estimates put the number of illegal immigrants in Europe at about 15 million .
The real endurance test for the revised Pact awaits us in the coming years .
In EU debates , for example , delocalisation is not regarded as an opportunity , but a threat to jobs in countries where production costs are higher than in countries where they are lower .
Secondly , despite these improvements I do not regard the public finance situation in individual Member States as satisfactory .
Let us update the regulations and bring them into line with reality !
Now , as the Commissioner has just told us , the Commission is proposing that one single report be drawn up every five years .
The rules in question are liable to distort competition and may affect trade between Switzerland and the EU .
Now is the time for us to seek solutions together to common problems which we face in the tax sector , as well as with regard to migration and integration .
3 . Common Fisheries Policy ( Regional Advisory Councils ) ( vote )
Thirdly , that recourse to intra @-@ Community imports be permitted , if the catches of the outermost regions &apos; fleets are not large enough to guarantee the profitability of the processing industries in these regions .
Solutions ensuring its funding must be found in the context of international cooperation .
in writing . - ( FR ) I abstained in the vote on the motion for a resolution on homophobia in Europe .
In our capacity as the country holding the EU Council Presidency , we have , over recent weeks , made it quite clear where we stand in relation to events in Zimbabwe .
We would ask the United Kingdom to use its presidency in the Security Council to add Zimbabwe to the agenda .
Absolute power corrupts absolutely .
It is therefore a disgrace that Putin &apos;s Government , which lays claim to be a world power and offers its services as a mediator in all international conflicts while strutting like a peacock , is acting against its own people in such a cowardly and violent manner .
However , today our response is not political - it is humanitarian , to say to whoever is listening : release Alan Johnston without harm and without hindrance .
Madam President , honourable Members , allow me , at this point , to make a brief comment on behalf of the Council and express how very depressing this topic is for all of us .
Nevertheless , there is cause for alarm .
Nevertheless , I can assure you that he is in good health - as we know , he takes care of his health - and he will be with us for the part @-@ session in Strasbourg .
Off @-@ licences , in particular , were targeted , but also some other shops .
We have strong bilateral relationships with Algeria , Morocco , Tunisia and Egypt , too .
Do they know that a continuation of this policy is the best way of contributing to Israel &apos;s insecurity ?
Wait ?
The sums paid out were often greater than in the period before the &apos; blockade &apos; .
I hope many colleagues will take a real opportunity to step up dialogue between ourselves in this Parliament and the leaders in the science and technology community within the European Union .
As a valued colleague of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , it is a pleasure to speak with you chairing the sitting here tonight .
Making the internal market a reality is indisputably one of the greatest success stories in European politics .
I could respond on these two points also , as well as tackle other subjects relating to the Horn of Africa and to the actions that we could take there , but the speaking time prevents me from doing so .
They are confused or refer to unspecified events not mentioned in the petition , or they try to undermine the argumentation of the report .
Madam President , honourable Members , enforcement of rights could be done on the basis of legislation .
( FR ) Mr President , I should simply like to ask my group , under these circumstances , to vote against .
With regard to the problems in Russia , for example the lack of respect for human rights and for the principle of the rule of law , the increase in trade is a good thing .
in writing .
As a French member of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , there is an urgent need , in my view , to put an end to the inconsistencies and contradictions between the various European texts relating to information and consultation of workers , in order to prevent abuses by dishonest companies .
The decisions of the Court , taken as they are with reference to specific cases , are not enough to define a health policy .
However , we are opposed to a development whereby patients would be transported all around the EU to wherever would be financially more advantageous for those who pay the costs .
( FR ) Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking our rapporteur , Mrs Vergnaud , who unfortunately had her work cut out with the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection because , as Commissioner Kyprianou pointed out to us , we have , on the one hand , case @-@ law , that is to say , in fact , the Treaties as interpreted by the Court of Justice , and , on the other hand , the position adopted by the European Parliament during the vote on the Services Directive , a position that clearly stated that a choice needed to be made between what falls under the internal market and what , for the sake of defending the social values of the Union , must fall under other mechanisms .
It is inevitable that , if people can travel to seek treatment abroad , there may be some competition ; people should have the choice .
The first is that the communication introduces the concept of ecosystem services into the EU @-@ level debate .
Much financial support and attention is needed for this .
The political signal sent out by our Parliament is clear : we want to defend environmental policies with budgets , because , while it is important for Europe to enact rules and to set objectives , it is just as important for it to release financial resources so as to pave the way for action at local level and also for innovation , exchanges of experiences and new practices .
We have therefore proposed to allow the Member States the option of establishing transitional areas , but with the obligation of reducing these areas in order to reach the environmental quality standards in the long term .
We must prevent such problems by providing healthy drinking water .
Having , as rapporteur , fought for Daphne for years on end , I rejoice that the increased budget of EUR 116 million makes it possible for us to reach far more NGOs ; the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality insisted on more transparency , on the removal of bureaucratic obstacles and on easier access with the smaller organisations in mind .
I would like to highlight the positive and irreplaceable role of voluntary organisations in this area .
draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets . - ( FR ) Mr President , I should like to thank you for giving me the floor as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets .
In addition , we must ensure that the approach to the competitiveness of our regions takes proper account of issues like population ageing , migration flows , climate change , energy and increased commercial competition .
Member of the Commission .
We think that this is more appropriately addressed in cooperation with other international donors , for example as part of the global aid for trade review at WTO level .
It is gradually leading to a loss of food security for the Union in general and for the new Member States in particular .
The development dimension of EPAs is in using market access , not merely granting it .
The social and environmental impacts of indiscriminately opening up local markets to international investment , which is mainly directed towards natural resources and the produce of the land itself , would exacerbate the lack of any effective economic return for the people of those countries . The only ones to benefit would be the large European multinationals .
The ACP countries insist that they are being put under pressure to negotiate on the Commission &apos;s terms and they are particularly concerned that the Commission has failed to give time for proper impact assessments and has dismissed any assessments that were not in line with its own position .
- Before the vote :
The rule would also allow the parties to agree , if they so wish , on more precise arrangements for their cooperation , which opens the door to possibilities such as a joint working group .
If urban and rural development goes on overlooking nature , our landscape will be dominated by cement and pollution .
The German Presidency of the Council is currently working hard to find a solution satisfactory not only to all those countries that rejected the Treaty , but also to the eighteen Member States , constituting the majority by population of the European Union , that have already ratified it .
We have to realise that we must not fail , or the result will be decline : the decline of an advanced idea of Europe , of a Europe that is able to be a leading player in the world thanks to its underlying values .
This urgency goes hand in hand with the need to simplify the Union and make it easier for its citizens to understand .
Some of us , in both political and normal life , have experienced failure , and this has now happened to the champions of the European Constitution .
No , indeed , the compromise can be neither a bluff nor a lie .
Only a great Leopard like you could govern with political parties that have the symbol of the hammer and sickle when you have presided over enlargement involving countries which have freed themselves from communism , and you actually manage to govern while representing only a third of our country .
For this reason , it is indispensable to have an institutional system that works effectively .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , we are facing an extremely difficult situation .
The time has come to restore the sovereignty of the States of Europe , so that they can once again play their role freely in that part of the world , where much of their future is at stake .
We must show that the European Union believes in international legality and says so to Israel , which is continually infringing it .
Fortunately , the Council and the Commission have taken a firm , clear stance , and I wish to thank them for that .
I plead with you to go to the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting and ask them to recognise the Palestinian Authority &apos;s government of national unity .
The Commission is currently working on the design of this scheme .
What I can say right now is that the timetable for Nabucco has been decided on and that the date of 2012 has been set .
We will do the same thing when the other numbers , apart from 116000 , are allocated with specified priorities , which will certainly include victims of forced prostitution .
I should like to ask the Commissioner two questions , rather to facilitate the debate .
The Commission expects that the parliamentary , and subsequent presidential , elections will be carried out democratically in an atmosphere of responsible debate and political stability .
I agree entirely with the Commissioner when he talks about a strategic partnership and the value of one , and states that we must continue the dialogue with Russia and must see what we can get out of it on the basis of our own principles and values .
Fascism is the pure child of capitalism .
Opening of the sitting
( CS ) I voted against the proposals on roaming calls , for the following reasons . Firstly , these measures are not economic but rather political in nature .
Furthermore , although my liberal philosophy does not sit well with interventionism on market prices , I am above all opposed to the laissez @-@ faire , lax approach and to cartels being formed in a given economic sector .
As the Rapporteur on Regulation ( EC ) No 883 / 2004 on the coordination of social security systems , I wish to make it clear to some in this House that the reimbursement situation is not a new system : it has been in place for over 30 years and has proved invaluable to thousands of citizens but its scope and workings should be determined by Parliament and Government - not the Court , so I regret the adoption of amendment 24 from the Liberals .
It &apos; highlights the development benefits that the Singapore issues may engender &apos; .
in writing .
The Union of today is not only many times bigger than the Community of the Six in those days ; it also has a much larger sphere of activity .
Together , we can use Europe &apos;s economic potential in an ever more integrated world economy .
To take key decisions on jobs , security and quality of life , the Union needs an end to unscrupulous use of national vetoes .
I am specifically thinking of offering countries like Ukraine , Moldova and Belarus a prospect of EU membership in the long @-@ term , this in combination with a powerful neighbourhood policy in order to help these countries overcome structural problems .
The question is whether all of this should be included in such a Constitution , or if it would be possible to refer to it using different means .
Not least in the Treaty that we will soon have , there are such things as European citizens , and European citizenship is a real thing ; we are here in the parliament of a supranational democracy and of a European citizenry .
We should , however , be clear about what it is that we are now offering to the citizens of the Union .
It was one that I did not understand .

There was an absence of any kind of secret ballot - and I could go on indefinitely , mentioning , for example , an electoral commission that was independent solely in name , but in fact was closely linked to the government .
I have one thought that I would like to share with you in relation to that .
Before the financial resources allocated to the Niger Delta are increased , total transparency should be ensured and dialogue between all the stakeholders established .

While the present government does indeed bear ultimate responsibility for the country , it has not changed the criteria ; it is rather the case that other groups in the country have threatened to intervene if the result that emerges is not to their liking .
Subject : Human rights in Chechnya
Once we are in this Parliament , however , Parliament constitutes a body in its own right , with its own personality , with the right to defend itself .
This legislative package constitutes the agricultural industry &apos;s framework conditions , and the overarching objective should be to create clarity regarding the framework conditions , and in such a way that those at whom this report is targeted , namely the operators , also perceive the changes as a simplification .
Another question that arises is what is the point of making all of these changes , when we are in the process of reforming the fruit and vegetable and wine markets anyway , and we do not know the results of the 2008 health check which will generally determine the future of the CAP .
It is encouraging that the composite dialogue process remains on track despite terrorism .
Kashmir was the exception to the rule .
Last but not least ; I believe we need to take action in order to protect the unique history of this people .
They give the protection of nature and the environment an enormous boost .
- ( PL ) Madam President , the planned construction of the Via Baltica has caused a lot of controversy , as have many other trans @-@ European transport routes .
I would like to take this opportunity to mention the fact that the European Commission has recently become too frequently and unnecessarily involved in matters which fall within the remit of Polish national and local government .
Welcome
However , in the European Union , there has recently appeared a so @-@ called &apos; innovation paradox &apos; .
Agenda : see Minutes
Europe , too , has alternatives to neoliberalism .
In an ideal situation , from the point of view of the Sudanese people , there would be no need for our involvement .
4 . The situation concerning the President of the World Bank
- Before the vote
( ES ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by saying that exactly a week ago , the Quartet was meeting in Berlin .
This is not an easy opportunity .
How can we ensure that it will not ?
At the same time , I would like to remind the House of the message from a peace conference held in Palestine in the last few days .
It is our duty to demand that Israel release the funds ; by the same token , it is our duty to ensure that the funds are indeed invested in economic and social development .
Israel &apos;s military actions and human rights violations are to be condemned .
As the next session of the Council is due to ...
What can we do ?
At the same time , however , they are aware that their little country has been abandoned .
Malta has its obligations and its attitude has been intolerable and deserves to be condemned .
The debate is closed .
I should like to conclude by saying that the adoption of the framework decision aimed at stepping up cross @-@ border cooperation , in particular in the fight against terrorism and crime , will clearly lack democratic legitimacy if Parliament &apos;s role is either partially or totally ignored .
The involvement of regional advisory bodies is not only helpful ; it is also an urgent necessity .
And in cases of the 60 % increase in assistance , as the Commissioner has quite rightly said , I hope that certain requests will be taken into account , such as integrated production or designations of origin .
One means of doing this is the creation of producer organisations , which enable growers to market their products more effectively .
We must be able to ensure that the impact within different regions in Member States is not too harsh .
11 . Consultation of the Visa Information System ( VIS ) ( vote )
in writing . - ( FR ) I voted in favour of the report by my esteemed colleague , Mr Böge of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund , with a sum of around EUR 24 million being granted to our Hungarian and Greek friends , following the floods suffered by these Member States and their populations in March and April 2006 .
The report should focus in particular on the employment structure and the financial situation of fishermen , ship owners and enterprises involved in cod fishing and processing .
This is indicative of deep disdain for the democratic sovereign will expressed by the people of these two countries in national referendums .
I do not think we have done that particularly well in the past , so we need more details on this issue .
Therefore , I request your consent to repeat the vote .
In doing so , we are using techniques that have been used before with great success .
It has been some time coming , but with this result , there is a good chance of an agreement at first reading .
Our Nordic colleagues and their allies are trying to have it both ways .
Now we come to my surprise .
Having said that , the Commission will continue to contribute constructively to the final adoption of this proposal , as soon as the underlying conditions are met .
Mrs Berès had some interesting ideas for new sector inquiries and I will indeed consider the subjects she touched upon : rating agencies , auditing firms and large investment banks .
We have progressed beyond that .
Parliament is taking a significant step towards changing the way in which we treat animals .
I was expecting this question , so I can tell you that EFSA has already been asked by the European Commission to provide a full objective assessment on the animal welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals , which was what Commissioner Dimas promised you .
I welcome also my own opportunity to make a contribution to this debate .
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law ( announcement of motions for resolutions tabled ) : see Minutes
It is quite ironic that , when you read through the speeches of the people who were there that day , who won the Nobel Peace Prize , all of them said that the peace efforts they were involved in only came about through dialogue , respect for diversity , tolerance and equality .
I am an advocate of simplification and of better lawmaking , but with one reservation .
It is important to mention , however , the change in the sphere of reference : the old fisheries agreements with third countries , which were commercial in nature , has been replaced by the new Partnership Agreements , with fisheries protocols , which will effectively work more and more as development aid .
The Polish PSE delegation have made every effort to ensure that the definition of vodka remains in line with Polish interests and have called for traditional recipes and regional methods be respected in the production of spirit drinks .
All of this is done in the name of the neoliberal Lisbon Agenda .
The mere fact that these issues should once again have received particular attention was already in itself good news .
This is why debt reduction is only possible under strict conditions , including good governance and transparency .
The Summit was surrounded by repression worthy of a police state .
Our disgraceful practice of giving with one hand and taking away - indeed , often taking away more - with the other must cease .
( NL ) Mr President , whilst it is a good thing that attention has been drawn to progress in some regions here today , the situation in black Africa is still tragic , as previous speakers , including Mr Van den Berg , have pointed out .
Let us intensify our efforts in a spirit of partnership so that we do not miss the 2015 deadline .
In the report , I suggest that this practice be abandoned , so that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly can function as a genuine joint assembly in which the democratic principle alone prevails .
Whilst fact @-@ finding missions in Malta , Spain and Senegal may be useful , they brought few new insights this time round , unfortunately .
The procedure whereby a parliamentary representative of the EU and one of the ACP together draw up a resolution for the Parliamentary Assembly is a fruitful one .
It contains other provisions that are also incompatible with the directive on public works , supply and services contracts .
I am in favour of such initiatives .
Our last convergence report , which covers the States with exceptions , was published in December 2006 , and in it the Commission concluded that Sweden met the price stability criterion , the criterion relating to the public budget situation and the criterion on the convergence of long @-@ term interest rates .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer .
All the data , therefore , will in principle be available from that date .
What impact does it expect the directive to have on the sector , and what is the Commission &apos;s strategy to induce Member States to cooperate more closely on defence procurement issues , to improve transparency and gradually open up their national defence procurement markets in order to establish a well @-@ performing and competitive environment for this sensitive sector ?
Following on from Mr Lambsdorff &apos;s question , I would be very interested to hear how the Commissioner intends to take account of the peculiarities of the defence sector in a directive .
I am pleased to adopt a position on a well thought @-@ out report by my colleague , Mr Papadimoulis .
For example , beryllium is known to cause berylliosis .
So that the export ban cannot be circumvented , my efforts have been directed at ensuring that it enters into force as quickly as possible and that it is extended to include other mercury products .
With regard to Malta &apos;s compliance with this criterion , therefore , there is no kind of particular situation or exception .
Both countries have fulfilled the convergence criteria stipulated in the Treaty .
We need to go beyond that , Mr Gloser .
I would like to make two comments on compliance with the criteria . In his speech , Mr Langen called into question the way in which Cyprus and Malta fulfil the criteria or the way in which the Commission &apos;s convergence report has assessed the compliance with those criteria .
( Applause )
Europe must show greater courage , it must have the heart of a lion and not be a chicken .
At least one of these countries does not meet these famous criteria and neither of the two , it seems , has supplied the statistics necessary for a proper assessment of their state of preparation .
Using European Union resources to fund abortion in Africa is contrary to the principle of providing support .
After all , it is better than nothing , and let us hope that one day human beings will have enough common sense to realise that there is no need to produce weapons at all .
MEDA and financial support to Palestine - evaluation , implementation and control ( debate )
As a first step , we intend to pay EUR 22 million directly from a reserve to help towards clearing the arrears of the Palestinian Authority , particularly to the private sector so that it sees there is some movement .
The two MEDA programmes add up to more than EUR 7 000 million in commitments and more than EUR 600 million per year .
On the basis of its Global Approach to Migration , the European Union has greatly intensified its cooperation with the countries of Africa and the Mediterranean region over the past year and a half .
What will this expert report find ?
The Council noted the European Parliament resolution of 14 February 2007 on extraordinary rendition on the agenda of the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 5 March 2007 .
Now Russia , implementing the project , is carrying out its own environmental impact assessment , saying that the weapons on the seabed are not dangerous .
Mr Seppänen , on the eve of the European Council , I do not wish to speculate today on the future of the European Constitutional Treaty .
I have heard what the Council has said , but I think it is sidestepping the issue here .
I congratulate the Commission on this very valuable proposal .
Tolerating certain expressions of hatred is , in actual fact , accepting them .
Whilst it is important to recognise , in legal terms , that the Member States have legal provisions at their disposal , it is also necessary to point out that there are major differences between these provisions , and that harmonisation needs to take place .
In an area without borders , an area of free movement , asylum is perhaps the clearest example of an area in which there needs to be harmonisation between the Member States and the creation of a common system .
We need to go beyond that .
The internet is borderless but consumers , businesses and regulators are not .
Another important point is the setting up of an EU charter of users &apos; rights and obligations in the information society .
They will also benefit from a more open market if they are able to compare prices and access more information .
Thank you , Mr Berman .
These measures would pave the way for the normalisation of relations between the EU and Cuba .
The process of democratisation has ground to a complete halt in that country .
The EU , along with neighbouring ASEAN countries , and along with India and China as well , must now do much more to apply pressure to secure Aung San Suu Kyi &apos;s release .
It is my great pleasure , Madam Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel , President of the European Council , to sincerely welcome you today to this extraordinary plenary session of the European Parliament .
To this end , a European citizens &apos; initiative will be introduced , as envisaged in the Constitutional Treaty .
First of all , the Union will be fully consolidated by overcoming the pillar structure and by acquiring a single personality .
Much took place behind closed doors , but we meet in public .
It is very good to hear the plaudits being shared out more widely today .
I can assure you , Mrs Merkel , that the triumphalism will be short @-@ lived .
We should not allow this distance to occur and shut people out again .
It has been , and I believe that is a mark of success .
I have enjoyed working with you personally , José Manuel , and I have also enjoyed working with the entire Commission and all its staff .
The following amendments have been proposed :
We provide possibilities , by which I mean that I do not fail to raise the issue with the ministers of health whenever we meet but , at the end of the day , the decision will be taken collectively by the governments of the Member States .
I feel I can but reiterate the content of the resolution and add my voice to the call for action and other points raised in the oral question .
I therefore strongly support the proposals in the second reading , including Amendment 2 , for example , which calls for the programme to provide citizens with better access to information , and Amendment 9 , which concerns policies aimed at leading a healthier lifestyle .
Such cases do not help that discussion very much .
And third , a letter from the EU to the United States acknowledging the receipt of assurances and confirming that on that basis it considers the level of protection afforded by the US Department of Homeland Security to be adequate for European PNR data .
It is too absurd for words that people do not have access to the data on which they appear to be judged .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission .
The dangers of mercury are well known , its neurotoxicity undisputed .
The first concerns the need to emphasise in the text of the directive that it is the responsibility of each Member State to identify the most appropriate forms and methods of implementing it : in other words , we must stress the principle of flexibility in the implementation of the directive , on the basis of which the measures , whether mandatory or not , should be put into practice without an excessively rigid approach .
I regret that little attention has been paid to this , and now this topic is getting beyond the scope of the concerns of the Commission Member responsible for communications .
We have , at some point , to get this relationship correct .
Others , by contrast , support a greater protective function for labour law .
The Commission must therefore promote the social dialogue both at national and European levels .
14 . Labour force sample survey ( vote )
I welcome this kind of initiative aimed at reducing Community bureaucracy and the exaggerated amount of time taken up over such simple matters as this .
The Council common position accepted by Parliament establishes a balance allowing both a reduction in the release of mercury in the environment while allowing a transition period for certain articles such as traditional barometers .
Despite the rapporteur &apos;s having mitigated the scope of the initial proposal , by underlining , for example , that &apos; the responsibility for the protection of critical infrastructures lies solely and exclusively with the Member States &apos; and considering &apos; that a Community approach is only justifiable if at least three Member States , or two Member States besides the one in which the critical infrastructure is situated , are affected &apos; , the fundamental objectives are not called into question .
A better exchange of information is needed between the authorities in the various Member States .
Surely that is not something you want to take the responsibility for ?
It is unacceptable that our efforts should be counteracted by poor financing practice .
We also notice that the launch of this system is far less swift than had been expected and that , alongside the new system , a second old system should remain in place .
The appearance of new competitors has brought a significant reduction in fares on numerous routes .
That alone will not reduce the numbers of people travelling - as a lot of people think it might - but in my opinion it will further enhance competition and benefit the travelling public .
I shall mention now the items under this heading that are due shortly .
It is no longer only the intention to shift cargo , but to improve every modality .
With regard to passengers &apos; rights , we have , thanks to Parliament , begun to introduce rights for passengers with reduced mobility in all modes of transport , particularly by coach and by sea .
If significant progress is not made in the short @-@ term on key issues for the EU , such as fake markets and payment of royalties , we will have to reconsider our approach with China in the IPR area .
This news has brought me great joy .
I think that Mr Calabuig Rull and Mr Carnero González , for example , made appropriate observations in stressing the fact that China is an opportunity for Europe , as well as a threat .
We have to move quickly .
That would be very much a backward step , and in my view , it would be inconceivable for us to go back on what has unanimously been agreed .
We will support you when it comes to defending the values of peace and solidarity , courage and responsibility .
Concerning the reform treaty - as you rightly mention the mandate has been set for the IGC in very specific terms - in many ways , despite what other people may think , we should expand or change those terms .
That would send the worst possible signal to the citizens of Europe and the world in general .
We are going to have Treaties 1 500 pages long , like telephone directories .
One such area is the new European Maritime Strategy to which the European Parliament will make a major contribution in today &apos;s vote .
We now have more responsibility during these six months and are well aware of the importance of the case .
- Before the vote
( Applause )
This was , of course , the main topic of discussion when , recently , at the start of the week , we met the French President , who came - and we ought to welcome this - to explain to us , at Eurogroup , the new headings and the new aims of France &apos;s economic and budgetary policy .
The Eurogroup debated it on Monday and Ecofin debated it yesterday .
The report then says that this action should not undermine the ECB &apos;s independence to use its interest rates to control inflation .
Firstly , because I believe that making use of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact does not make it possible to implement that which we need , that is to say , ex @-@ ante coordination in order to organise future strategic investment in a coordinated way and to anticipate , together , the effects of the structural reforms , because what happens in a country in terms of structural reforms has an impact on all the other countries .
That being said , I should like briefly to point out some commitments made by France .
While there are improvements in productivity , those improvements must be reflected in the development of wages .
Perhaps Tony Blair will now break loose from some of the ties that bound him - cross @-@ Atlantic ties and others - and will be able to take on a different role .
Tony Blair was one of the crusaders in Iraq .
Member of the Commission .
I call on Serbia to play a constructive role in the next phase of the process .
Commissioner , Council , I would urge you to tell us finally what a resolution should contain as a minimum in order to spur the EU to send a mission to Kosovo in the short term .
After the new democratic government - which is Europe- and reform @-@ oriented - was formed , and after this new government made a clear commitment to cooperation with the ICTY and carried out such effective and practical action to match that commitment , we were able to resume the SAA talks with Serbia about a month ago .
On 30 November 2006 the European Parliament again adopted a determined position on the issue of access to medicines in the south of the world and unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the Commission , and I quote , &apos; to recognise , five years after the adoption of the Doha Declaration , that its application has been a failure , inasmuch as the WTO has received no notification from an exporting or importing country of compulsory medicines nor any such notification under the Decision of 30 August 2003 of the General Council of the WTO on implementing paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration &apos; .
What , do you have a magic wand ?
Adequate , high @-@ quality provision of childcare services still falls to the Member States .
Clearly , new and significant efforts need to be made by Turkey in this area .
I have to say also that given that the DCI was only approved last December and it is very much a new process for all of us , Parliament has hit the boards running .
In its draft country strategy papers for individual countries , the Commission has repeatedly overstepped its executive powers , and not taken the aims of the DCI into account .
Madam President , Members of Parliament .
The financial envelope for the 2008 @-@ 2012 programme in fact represents an increase of 15 % compared to the previous period .
These regional differences are more apparent in today &apos;s enlarged European Union than they were in the original fifteen .
To conclude , all measures in the report are very important , including , of course , equal rights for men and women , which is a serious problem in these regions .
It confused me .
He was a tyrant and a criminal but he was assisted in gaining power by the West , including , unfortunately , some European states .
They need our help .
Although I already spoke about this matter in Parliament a year and a half ago , as did Mrs Korhola some eighteen months later , I sadly find myself having to utter virtually the same words .
Written statements for entry in the register ( Rule 116 ) : see Minutes
That is why , I am taking the liberty in asking the European Commission to request the power to sign the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings on behalf of the European Communities from the Council .
Prefab houses are the main urban renovation problem in the new EU Member States .
Our primary concern now is to look ahead to the next stage , which is already in progress .
An attempt is being made in Greece to reduce the level of forest protection by revising Article 24 of the Constitution .
We gave a timely warning of the grievous consequences , and we have , alas , been proved most tragically right .
Hundreds of fires broke out simultaneously , everywhere , throughout the day and night , and in all directions .
I especially want to welcome the statement made by Commissioner Dimas on 31 July in which he stressed the importance of the report by former Commissioner Barnier and its implementation so that Europe can be properly equipped with a civil protection mechanism capable of providing the response that has been lacking .
The European Union and its Member States must put particular focus on the proper restoration and reconstruction of these devastated areas .
This is a breach of the basic legal principles of the EU Member States and the European Union as a whole .
Furthermore , where certain directives are concerned , the constitutional regions have a role to play in the transposition process .
Brussels must learn to accept it when citizens say &apos; no &apos; , and must learn to base its decisions on the will of the people .
Soft law may also be applied by the European Court for the interpretation of provisions , however .
Without impact assessment , the legislator is not in a position to assess the practical outcomes of its action .
Therefore , my question is : can anything more be done to make certain that the EURES portal is more widely available to those individuals who do not necessarily go through job search centres , but just want to access the net themselves .
It seems to me that this is unfair to those who might want to move , but it is doubly unfair to those who have already moved and are living - in some cases for a long time - in Ireland with their spouses and who are now being deported .
Now let me move on to our shared policy priorities for the single market .
As for small companies , we all know that the EU , its economic partners and the World Trade Organisation will continue to crush them .
This lack of homogeneity may be considered an advantage for certain neo @-@ liberal policies , but not for all citizens .
My final point is this : an effective market implies effective safeguards and consumer protection .
That is why we need a more in @-@ depth analysis .
We have repeatedly reminded the Polish authorities of this possibility .
( PL ) Mr President , the Gdańsk Shipyard has particular significance for Poland .
In my view , this is a question that Parliament should debate , because the well @-@ being of our children , who should be taken to school by their parents , is a matter that it behoves this Parliament to address .
Solidarity came fully into play through the &apos; European rapid reaction instrument &apos; that we voted for last March , a joint civil protection system in which 30 States make resources such as Canadairs , tankers and qualified personnel ( &apos; green berets &apos; ) available to countries suffering man @-@ made or natural disasters .
The report also lays emphasis on consumer protection , which is closely linked to the completion of the European Single Market and has to be guaranteed .
Portugal still has a long way to go by European standards .
More rapid approval must not , however , call into question the principles of good budgetary management .
I would like to come back again to the other institutions .
We had about five working meetings .
I certainly welcome the fact that not only does the report shed light on rules that affect public safety , it is also extended to inland waterways goods transport , because many of us think that is a mode of transport that should be developed throughout Europe as an alternative to road transport .
Logistics are a major problem .
Everyone involved has a duty to ensure that logistics operations proceed smoothly .
The rules do need to be tidied up .
For the first time , the adoption of basic rules on the Single Sky has given the Community real powers in this area .
Is the situation any better today , Commissioner ?
Both Member States and the Commission may bring an action before the European Court to challenge the legality of these measures .
It is most important for budget funds to be made available rapidly in such cases .
What are the Commission &apos;s views on the evident refusal of Greece to implement Directive 1999 / 70 / EC ?
These projects provide support for Eastern Europe , the Middle East and ACP countries and concentrate on people with mental and physical disabilities , capacity @-@ building , community rehabilitation , the rights of disabled people , social inclusion , poverty reduction , de @-@ institutionalisation , etc .
Unfortunately , bad habits travel fast and are very easily copied , especially by young people .
The aim is rather to take a strong line against the spread of alcohol consumption among the very young .
( PL ) Mr President , alcohol abuse is currently a serious social problem in the European Union .
Why , too , do old people , isolated at home , drink too much ?
At last there is a single document with targets which can hopefully only be developed .
Not only industry and trade , but also milk producers - our farmers - stand to benefit because this standardisation of protein can yield a higher valorisation of the milk .
The quality class system for butter would be simplified , the strict classification for fat content abolished , aid for school milk made independent of its fat content and the intervention system clarified .
I wish the Commissioner all the best on the way to further reforms of the agricultural policy .
I believe we can start on the gradual process of increasing milk quotas from today .
Our group has taken the initiative of having this debate because we believe that Europe has not yet fully realised the extent of the dangers facing it .
Thus it is theoretically possible that the purpose is not only to combat terrorism , but also to tackle bicycle theft or bank fraud .
Secondly , it is public knowledge that the Council already systematically undertook the necessary revision of its procedures with respect to the list of persons and entities to which Regulation ( EC ) No 2580 / 2001 applies .
A lack of urgency has become apparent with regard to the Council &apos;s progress on a number of points .
This sets out a large number of points being implemented or to be implemented by the EU Member States and the EU itself .
We know that agencies , even within one state , will not share information because of jealousies , power struggles and turf wars , let alone through cross @-@ border cooperation .
The third example is PNR .
Furthermore , much more efficient measures , which have already been approved , have not been implemented .
Does this process of getting used to terrorism mean that we in Europe are well prepared to fight it ?
Finally , in order to fight terrorism we need to work towards creating a fairer and more balanced international community ; we need to identify causes and fractures , promote a culture of rights that takes in all peoples , and work hard to promote dialogue between civilisations .
In my introduction I gave some specific indications about some proposals .
Take , for example , the case of thonaille fishing in the Mediterranean .
At all events , however , we should be working towards standardising implementation - that is , ensuring uniformity of checks - so as to put an end once and for all the vexation we are currently experiencing at airports .
While I am delighted about the adoption of the own @-@ initiative report by Mrs Ayala Sender on logistics , which underlines the importance of intermodality for cleaner and more sustainable transport , I can only lament the adoption of paragraph 21 , against which I had already voted in the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
The barriers to production have limited production .
These are issues that prudential authorities and supervisors will need to focus on in the time ahead .
Mrs Merkel , our President @-@ in @-@ Office at the time of the G8 , told us to take measures concerning hedge funds , and nobody listened to her .
This could reduce investment movements or , in some cases , even bring them to a halt .
Over @-@ reaction may be equally as damaging as what has already occurred , as we find the price of credit rising as a result .
We all know that the real economy is based on production , distribution and the consumption of goods in accordance with people &apos;s needs , whether those needs be real , imagined or created by advertising .
Further choices are also needed so that we can adapt in order to protect lives .
I think that this is very important and that it shows that our female Members are particularly sensitive regarding such a fundamental issue .
Does the Council believe we can make progress in the Middle East without bringing Hamas to the table ?
Similarly , social tolerance needs to be developed .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( PT ) This question will probably receive the fastest answer this session because it is not , in fact , within the Council &apos;s brief to comment on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference for the reform of the Treaties which , as we know , began on 23 July 2007 .
I hope , therefore , that our statement allays and provides a response to the concerns which the honourable Member expressed .
This is quite interesting .
Indeed , this report reaffirms the universality of human rights and anchors them as fundamental principles of the European Union &apos;s relations with third countries .
I am on the side of the Czech Foreign Minister , Karel Schwarzenberg , who sees no contradiction between being a friend of America and a critic of its human rights breaches .
I am also taking the chance offered by this debate to call representatives of the Council and the Commission to better interinstitutional cooperation .
The criteria we apply to the subject of human rights should be clearly laid down for all countries , and most importantly they should be identical .
This progressive approach will allow environmental , economic and social aspects to be explored .
It should be noted that FMSY , which is the fishing mortality rate , should not be confused with MSY , which is the catch level .
Good examples of some success can be seen in stocks such as saithe , North Sea haddock and mackerel , which are fished close to MSY level and which are generally stable and profitable .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , I would also like to express my particular thanks not only to Commissioner Kuneva , who has presented us with a very good text , but also our rapporteur , Mrs Patrie , who has done outstanding work and progressed the dossier in key respects , so that despite the many contentious points arising in our committee , we are , overall , on track towards good legislation .
Although such instruments are important for consumers &apos; rights , they can also disturb a certain legal order .
As a result there is no new shopping and the economy and the prosperity of consumers relying on it do not grow as much as they could .
I tell Mr Harbour that Finland has better consumer protection than the UK .
It is not enough simply to put a set of standards of this nature in place : they have to be effective .
I went to China ; this problem has not caught us by surprise .
They must be accompanied by other public policies aimed at improving people &apos;s living conditions by guaranteeing access to healthcare , food , housing , schooling , educational success and stable employment , and by protecting the rights to a fair wage , to freedom of creation and cultural enjoyment , and to sports .
in writing . - I supported this report , which calls on the Commission and Council to ensure a greater degree of coherence in the EU &apos;s human rights dialogues with third countries .
Some of these countries even legitimise themselves through democratic elections .
This comes on top of our significant humanitarian aid .
I am talking about the wholesale and systematic gang rape that takes place in Bangladesh .
The Special Court is itself an example for the reform of Sierra Leone &apos;s judicial system and I would call on the Commission here to look into the possibility of providing financial support for the projects carried out by the United Nations with a view to reforming the country &apos;s judicial system .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes
Sitting on 10 and 11 October
The European Commission subsequently carried out an analysis of this matter . The conclusion was that the European Commission considers the issue of the decrees of President Beneš to be resolved and closed .
As a citizen of a country with enough experience in the matter , I know how difficult it is to keep politics away from trying to exploit such an economic dependency .
I would like briefly to outline the key points of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development &apos;s opinion .
Today 80 % of the EU &apos;s energy is produced using fossil fuels , mainly oil and gas .
The key question is security of investment .
We should ensure that we really do achieve the target of renewables accounting for 20 % of our final energy consumption by the year 2020 .
We must carry out a macro @-@ economic assessment to build on our earlier technical approach .
When allocating targets for the proportion of renewable energy to each Member State it is difficult to do so fairly , and to ensure that each Member State is actively involved in making use of renewable energy .
Compliance with a minimum binding target of 10 % for biofuels used in transport would be an unfortunate example of this .
What is required is social interoperability that will allow drivers from different countries to think of themselves as Europeans , rather than nationals of a particular state .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , many of us probably know the story of the Captain of Köpenick , and many of us have also laughed at what happened .
From the point of view of train crews all three versions had room for improvement .
As a keen cyclist I am especially pleased by the provisions for carrying bicycles on the train .
It is an ambitious goal , but absolutely essential for facilitating development of the European high @-@ speed rail network and cross @-@ border operating arrangements relating to it .
This proposal must be adopted as soon as possible - that is , before the end of this month - in order to allow farmers to take their decisions for growing crops on set @-@ aside land in 2008 .
Let me also personally congratulate the rapporteur .
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , as a Member of this Parliament for the Czech Republic where the sugar market has already been restructured , I cannot agree with the proposed changes .
It also needs pointing out that the Commission is currently not implementing the principles of the reform , the aim of which is to maintain production in the most competitive regions .
Toys are not like any other product . They are designed for the most vulnerable consumer group of all and it is therefore perfectly clear that we must have the highest standards for toys where children &apos;s safety is concerned .
Although Commissioner Verheugen was really quite exhaustive in his exposé , let me say that as regards revision of the so @-@ called New Approach Package , taking special care of the health and safety of European citizens requires us to preserve the specific and successful system established by the General Product Safety Directive .
We also demand that products be manufactured in decent working conditions without risks to the health and safety of employees .
This raises the serious question of what sort of future we want for our children .
Not only does this discussion about toys provide evidence that CE labelling is misleading , but also the many discussions at home with our citizens do so too .
In the debate on whether it is desirable to support or abolish further use of the CE marking I support its retention , provided that entitlement and marking are monitored by the Member States &apos; supervisory authorities .
These already exist for safety in the workplace and for food safety , so why not for product safety too ?
- Report : Niebler
I do not know whether this was referred to the Consultative Working Party of the legal services set up under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for official codification of legislative texts .
This reform was drawn up in 2005 and was supposed to restore equilibrium in this market .
I believe that Scotland &apos;s efforts have a vital role to play in the EU &apos;s targets for renewable technology .
Parliament called for the European Union to take such an initiative in two resolutions adopted this year in February and in April .
We cannot agree to the kind of censorship proposed by Mr Schulz in his speech .
People are wavering , even in States that still maintain the death penalty , such as the US , and coalitions are forming in Muslim countries .
Why a closer relationship with Brazil ?
We also welcome the fact that Brazil has already declared itself willing to discuss the problem of the destruction of the rainforest in the Amazon , because this is essential for stabilising the climate .
For all these reasons a strategic partnership with Brazil is justified , because this country is a strategic partner of the European Union in its own right .
We are studying that possibility and , as I say , as a possibility for the Portuguese Presidency &apos;s agenda , which is , as you all know , a very full and very complex agenda , but we shall do what we can to be able to relaunch - at the political level too - this debate with the Mercosur countries .
We would be misguided to do so .
( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , in his letter Michel Platini , President of UEFA , asks the leaders of the 27 EU Member States to intervene by dealing with the rising wealth of football clubs , which are spending ever more on players and other purchases , thus turning football into a business rather that a sport with values .
Member of the Commission . - When the CAP reform was agreed among the Ministers in the Council in 2003 , it was the mandate that was given to the trade and agricultural commissioners . Within this mandate we could negotiate .
These research areas are the ones which will be supported through calls for proposals during the 2007 @-@ 2013 period .
This is one of the areas .
( DE ) Madam President , please allow me to speak on the Rules of Procedure .
Although there have been a number of discussions with both the Commission and the Council since the Committee on Budgets adopted its opinion , the matter of the Institute &apos;s financing has not yet been solved satisfactorily .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , it is excellent that , despite earlier doubts , we now have the opportunity for constructive comments to be made in Parliament on the subject of the establishment of a European Institute of Technology .
If this is supposed to help it to come into being , I am sure no one will have any objections .
The result means that I can now express my support for the EIT , insofar as it is a new and promising instrument for integrating the three axes of knowledge : education , research and innovation , which we hope will add value to the existing instruments .
I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Saryusz @-@ Wolski for very good cooperation .
The recent British and Austrian missions in respect of potential gas suppliers for Nabucco , Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan also serve as evidence of European decisiveness .
Three months later the journalist Ivan Safronov , a critic of the Putin regime who just weeks earlier had been vigorously interrogated by the FSB , as the KGB is now called , mysteriously fell to his death from his apartment window , still clutching a recently purchased bag of shopping .
Energy today is strategic for the European Union , as coal and steel were decades ago .
This is in the interests of all Member States , but it is especially important for Hungary , which at present is reliant solely on Russian gas .
This means we have to attend to the environmental aspect , even though this has been very much neglected in recent years , simply by making continual set @-@ aside possible , whereby a large proportion would be taken into production for energy products .
Some of these conclusions call for urgent action to strengthen current measures and existing arrangements .
We must continue along the path initiated at the Ministerial Conferences held in Rabat and Tripoli and the Brussels World Forum , placing the emphasis on the link between immigration and development .
Because our agricultural and fisheries policies are out @-@ pricing their products and raiding their natural resources .
All of these aspects have been addressed after a fashion or will be in the near future through directives , action plans and other instruments .
On the contrary , they continue to come to Europe , at great personal risk , to find better living conditions and for many of them it is a question of survival .
The EU countries are so different that uniform rules are impossible to administer .
I am grateful for the support given to halving the number of victims within ten years with a view to eliminating the practice completely .
In our opinion , two essential words form the basis of this policy , humanity and solidarity : humanity because this policy is based on the people and is aimed at the people .
His Holiness is the spiritual leader of the Sant Nirankari Mission , also known as the Universal Brotherhood .
This confirms , once again , that Parliament was not mistaken when it highlighted the unduly low level of budgetary resources allocated to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
However , this measure does not resolve the fundamental issue of the need to increase the production and supply of each Member State and employment in rural areas .
We need to take immediate steps to free ourselves of our raw material dependence on Russia , which may subsequently become a political dependence .
However , although I realise that integration is important , I believe it must occur with the consent of our citizens .
For these reasons I supported the adoption of the report during the final vote in plenary .
It should be noted that the EU Member States were also faced with the complexity which , in this respect , typifies the system of sorting and processing requests for overflight , landing and on @-@ the @-@ ground inspection authorisations .
Our request certainly could have been acted on by the German Presidency and now the Portuguese Presidency .
Why have only 12 Member States signed the UN Convention on enforced disappearance , notable absentees from signature being the UK , Germany , Spain , Poland and Romania - a funny list that - as well , of course , as the US ?
I want to hear a European Council say that we are to put pressure on the USA , that their kidnappings must cease and that all prison camps must be closed .
Finally , Mr President , this debate gives us one more reason to introduce the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the future constitutional treaty or institutional treaty , whatever it may be called .
Finally , this Parliament welcomes the mandate of the force which will act under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations .
We would not have achieved enough if we handed on the baton after a year with the same number of people still in the camps .
We are also preparing for additional action through diplomatic channels and will remain in contact with the United Nations , in particular with Ibrahim Gambari , Special Envoy of the Secretary @-@ General , who met with the presidency and institutions of the European Union in July , in other words immediately before the summer recess .
And , as colleagues have said , it is up to us to use our influence , not just against the Burma regime but also our influence with China , India and Bangladesh to ensure that there is coherence and adherence to the sanctions that are in place and the demands for democracy .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( PT ) Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union will assess the current reform process in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the annual report on the progress made , which is scheduled for November as usual .
On 28 September , also in New York , further separate meetings will be held between the Troika and the parties , possibly followed by an initial direct meeting between the parties on the same day .
Is the Council aware of any negative consequences resulting from its decision in June 2006 to transmit on the Council website the proceedings of its meetings at which legislation is debated by ministers ?
In the meantime , another 10 chapters have been opened .
The problem is that the acquis communautaire does not protect consumers who purchase services as well as consumers who purchase goods .
Those in this House that sat on the Temporary Committee of Inquiry into the Crisis of the Equitable Life Assurance Society also saw only too clearly that there is this problem of confidence .
Where consumers feel uncertain about the safety and quality of services , they tend to build up psychological barriers towards foreign suppliers , which dissuade them from using cross @-@ border services .
I want Parliament to move ahead and help us make this very beautiful project a reality .
So this is a perfect initiative in the Year of Equal Opportunities for All .
As part of our commitment to helping Member States improve their education and training systems , the Commission &apos;s communication showed that efficiency and equity do not have to come at the expense of each other , at the expense of quality .

The rest of Europe is in third place with four or five , with Canada and Australia hot on their heels .
We also need to learn why a child &apos;s developing brain is affected in these ways and how to prevent these &apos; dys &apos;abilities where that is possible .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , I wish to start by congratulating the staff and Members who took this initiative of a written declaration and an oral question , and also the Commission for its attendance at this time of night to discuss this issue which , regrettably , not only seems to be a secret issue , an issue for absolute discretion , but also an issue that is completely invisible in certain cases .
They provide an opportunity to break through the walls of silence , with which China surrounds the exercise of the death penalty .
Your views on the points sketched out here will be an essential input for the package , which we will adopt in December .
( Applause )
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( DA ) Mr President , the EU published the new draft Treaty at 5 p.m. on Friday - thus satisfying itself that the media would not write about it at the weekend .
I no longer know what the texts , references , footnotes and traps mean .
For example , the States may reinstate the death penalty if there is an imminent danger of war .
However , Lisbon still does not bring us to our goal .
Let them be honest : if they do not achieve better unification or integration of the EU , then let England , France , Germany , Poland face the challenges of globalisation alone .
For our Parliament , this is a real political challenge .
And I am surprised that a government from a country that has so often said that it is the example to us all in terms of being communautaire , that it has a strong European commitment , that it is not nationalist , it always puts Europe before its national interests , that now Italy and Mr Prodi is arguing that Italy , for reasons of national prestige , should have the same number of seats as France and the UK , even though its population does indeed differ .
It is based on a maximum and a minimum level and on account being taken of the number of people in the different countries . This principle is also tenable looking to the future .
Is that what we are here for ?
That is by how much the Polish representation in the European Parliament is diminished under the proposal that has been tabled today .
Within the limits set by the Council , this political compromise by Mr Severin and Mr Lamassoure is a reasonable and well @-@ balanced effort to achieve fair play and solidarity for all the people of the European Union .
Our direct emergency support to low income and social hardship cases continues through the payment of social allowances .
Let us , however , make it clear that it appears that raising the standard of living in the Gaza Strip , normal functioning of hospitals and schools , full access to drinking water , food and electricity , the potential to work normally in agriculture are more likely to cause a fall in tension in Palestinian @-@ Israeli relations and to ensure a weakening of the potential for enmity , where Jewish settlers , Israeli settlers and the State of Israel as such are concerned .
I believe that it would be useful for Parliament to take a stand on this issue .
Just as the European Union must exercise equal guidance to the Palestinians to desist from violence , so that both may achieve their objectives for secure statehood through the only available effective means , which are peaceful means .
We well know that there are enormous challenges ahead .
We know that it is very critical , but we accept that criticism because at the end of the day we are trying to implement the 2002 reforms of the common fisheries policy .
Although it has not been possible to carry out the analysis required ( not forgetting that the devil is in the detail ) , my initial reactions are as follows :
There is , moreover , the case referred to in the report of two Dutch citizens who were also feminicide victims .
On that day , Anna Politkovskaya , considered to be a living symbol of honest journalism , was brutally murdered .
The follow @-@ up to this general obligation is , as far as EAGGF and EAFRD spending is concerned , to be found in the Commission &apos;s proposal .
The phrase &apos; from farm to fork &apos; means just that .
thirdly , lawbreakers to be punished ;
I think we do need to review the use that the information is put to .
The new system will also provide for the possibility of regular monitoring of the effectiveness of the risk analysis made .
These people will actually be much more crucial than equipment and systems , and so , Commissioner , I would earnestly request you to have a reasonably thorough look at the proposals and recommendations and take them to heart .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Madam President , first of all I would like to make an apology to you , to the Vice @-@ President of the Commission and to honourable Members , because after I have made my speech I will have to leave the Chamber to do an interview .
For EU airlines it means more transatlantic flights to the United States .
This industry does not deserve the environmentalist hostility which is often heaped upon it .
Taxes and aviation fuel surcharges resulting in price increases are also likely to have a bearing on the estimates .
This is why I believe that the European programmes , such as Caesar and Clear Sky , will bring important contributions to the development of the European air sector .
I am sure everybody understands that this is an important difference .
It is a mockery , however , to say that prices are rising so this could justify cutting subsidies .
As one of my Irish colleagues said in the debate , &apos; Turkeys don &apos;t vote for Christmas &apos; .
I am concerned by the deterioration of health indicators in Palestine and aware of the difficulties posed by closure of border control posts , thereby curtailing economic activity and free circulation of goods , and I request that emergency and humanitarian aid be allowed to continue unhindered .
It therefore advocates increasing the minimum number of service providers admitted at airports , not setting an artificial limit on the number of third @-@ party handlers and removing constraints preventing ground handling service providers from entering the market .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - Mr President , if nobody else is speaking against , I will speak against .
( Applause )
Serving a final warning to the Maltese authorities is , I believe , an important step .
Within Ireland we are establishing an all @-@ Ireland energy market with the merging of electricity markets north and south .
Products with harmful effects must not be authorised at all ; it is not enough to cut their use by half .
There are now satellite systems which can introduce the spray at the right time , and you can actually reduce the amount of spray and chemical you use .
It will affect the environment , it will affect health and it will affect groundwater .
The companies are hardly likely to tell them that researchers have started asking questions about the link between exposure to pesticides and the steadily increasing incidence of certain conditions such as Parkinson &apos;s disease , Alzheimer &apos;s , prostate cancer , brain tumours and congenital deformities .
In addition to the general guidelines , strategies for the sustainable use of pesticides should be developed at national level , where appropriate action can be taken .
Therefore , I am glad to be able to speak for a second time .
Firstly , the Commission is convinced that mandatory adherence to common general rules on integrated pest management by professional pesticide users is a fundamental measure to reduce dependence on pesticides .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( EL ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I think that from a political viewpoint the subject we are debating today is about two objectives of equal importance , as the rapporteur , Mr Corbett , has said .
Finally , let me just touch upon the way in which cars are promoted .
Tomorrow Parliament will vote in favour of one of the options on the table , and it must be said that , whatever it is , whatever year is designated and whatever average value is set , it will still be more stringent and ambitious than any other regime in the world .
The car industry needs clear , long @-@ term targets for reducing the level of CO2 emissions in exhaust gases and I support Mr Davies &apos; approach whereby long @-@ term limits will be established for CO2 emissions , for example for 2020 or 2025 .
Let me start by addressing the issue of energy innovation .
Competitiveness cannot be a function of false market incentives , and the price of energy has to reflect its real cost .
How is it that the Lisbon knowledge @-@ based economy works in this way ?
In this sense , the support to the appeal of the Commission to introduce common nuclear safety reference levels in the European Union is a crucial aspect of the report .
This will take time , but you can be assured that the Commission will perform the correct assessment and will not hesitate if we have any doubts about the safety of this equipment .
The Committee will have far fewer members than its predecessor , the European Advisory Committee on Statistical Information in the Economic and Social Spheres ( CEIES ) , and the reduction from 79 to 24 members will make it considerably more efficient .
The Commission strongly believes that minimum rates are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market by providing a safety net for Member States which ensures that all Member States actually apply excise duties and that the levels are meaningful .
In any case , even the British cannot get it right for all of our country .
What do we disagree with ?
In that case , Poland will have a permanent Advocate @-@ General and no longer take part in the rotation system , while the existing rotation system will involve the rotation of five Advocates @-@ General instead of the current three .
The Treaty of Lisbon will reinforce the democratic nature of the European Union .
We - as Europeans , as states and as Parliament - are being asked to face up to this issue and have been asked to do so , ladies and gentlemen , not just for a few years now , but for a very long time .
However , the national parliaments will have their say and there is a real chance that we will get more referendums than just in Ireland .
This is definitely not appropriate for European cooperation .
Mr President , I would like to say to the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council : what a wonderful summit .
This is what most MEPs in here think .
We shall also be striving for this in the future .
I too would like to praise the previous Presidency , as I have always done and always do in the same way .
We have always said so and if this has not been relayed to you , it is not our problem , but yours .
Therefore , it is not a procedural issue , but a question of political attitude .
( HU ) As a Member representing the Hungarian Democratic Forum ( Magyar Demokrata Fórum - MDF ) , I will be using my vote to support both of these draft legislative texts providing for stricter regulations and greater control concerning the use of plant protection products .
This must be ensured by regular checks .
As for the policy on buildings generally , I hope that all the institutions can together establish a common organisation to consider when and where to build and when and where to purchase property , so that we do not make decisions without knowing what others are doing and artificially raise property prices .
The list is long and Parliament is asking to be convinced of the goodwill of the European executive .
The rest goes to preposterous things , and to different kinds of PR work , such as the money for adaptation to globalisation .
The pilot project should therefore be carried out as we have devised it .
Evidently , as Mr Virrankoski said , this all requires a firm and resolute policy which also embraces the revision of procedures , which I fully support .
One might understand from this why the European budget is lacking in transparency and really in efficiency too .
As yet there has been no ex ante agreement or policy dialogue , and until this happens , I agree with placing EUR 40 million in reserve for the CFSP .
The budget we have proposed operates a 9 % increase in finances for lifelong learning programmes , reaching a total amount of 900,000,000 euros .
The Presidency must realise that , with the exception of Galileo and the Common Foreign and Security Policy , everything can be decided by Parliament on its own .
One could say that , relatively speaking , we have a low number of infections - for example , about 250 in Italy as compared to more than 150 000 on the island of Réunion a few years ago .
The Turkish authorities are understandably trying to engage the US , Iraqi and Iraq &apos;s Kurdish authorities in their efforts .
One of the results of the staff screening was that the task of 32 % of the Commission &apos;s staff is to administer the administration , that is , to provide administrative support and coordination .
Secondly , did I hear you say that the current proposals also fully accord with the new package you and Commissioner Piebalgs have presented ?
In 2003 , for example , the Commission initiated in total only eight new investigations , the first of which was initiated at the end of May in that year .
On 1 April 2006 , eight new Member States received this restructuring reserve varying from between 2 % and 5 % of their national quota level .
Mr President , I want to focus on the position in the intensive sector .
A large amount of the meat coming from Brazil , to name but one country we have discussed , is almost certainly produced using GM @-@ grain .
Anyone reading the resolution can come to only one conclusion : the European Parliament is opting henceforth for a zero @-@ tolerance policy on smoking .
This has now been reduced to EUR 300 million , but is still many times greater than the sum channelled into information to induce young people to stop smoking .
Those who have taken up selling this product will not hesitate to sell to someone under age .
We have to be able to advise and explain the problems to people , and also give them incentives not to smoke or to give up smoking .
I am delighted , however , by what has just been said by Mr Mandelson , who has himself announced a group of experts to find other measures , and an evaluation of these measures , and I think we will be discussing these matters again once we have seen whether the effectiveness meets our expectations .
I should acknowledge that the EQF is a technical , even complex instrument .
They often have to accept jobs which pay less and for which they are overqualified .
in writing . - ( BG ) It is necessary to point out that the informal educational sector is underdeveloped , rather unknown and often isolated from the formal one .
These were unanimous decisions of all 27 Member States .
Shortly before the adventure on its eastern borders , the price of oil in Turkey was USD 76 a barrel in Europe ; now , owing to its arms , to which it always has recourse when solving its own problems , oil has risen to more than USD 90 a barrel .
The US Senate and House of Representatives have just said the same and it is unfortunate that this Parliament is lagging behind the Americans on this issue .
This is a chance to give fresh impetus to the accession process in several key areas .
Given the interdependence of the European Union and Russia in terms of energy , confidence must be increased and mutual cooperation reinforced .
Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra was right .
Our duty is to combat these manipulations , since Russia is pushing the limits of our patience .
We are trying very hard from our side to ensure that .
These are our inalienable values and principles which must guide our relations with third countries in all cases .
- Recommendation for second reading : Gauzès
- Report : Toma
However , if the translation costs are deemed to be insupportable in future , the minimum must be that the verbatim report contains the speaker &apos;s original language and an English translation .
( LT ) It is a shame that the launch of SIS II keeps being postponed .
I did not support amendments endorsing nuclear power : my view is that sustainable , renewable energy resources should be developed and that research &amp; development efforts should focus on these areas first .
The impact of road transport on air quality must be reduced as the vehicle fleet is gradually renewed .
It is also important to lay down the Member States &apos; sovereignty in the field of taxation .
There is already a trend for people to become non @-@ smokers and , in line with the principle of sovereignty , it should remain a matter for each country to decide whether smoking bans should be introduced in restaurants , for example , and what form these bans should take .
in writing . - ( PT ) Regardless of the end result , the current negotiations with Turkey must bring about the reforms which the country so desperately needs and which , in themselves , are the most important aspect of a country &apos;s potential accession to the EU .
I call on Serbia and the Serbian people to wake up now , to start helping themselves , to help their neighbours , to help the entire region and to join us .
Thank you , Mr President .
Natural relations with Serbia will also be given a boost with the visa agreement that has been concluded .
At the end of the process - according to Belgrade &apos;s calculations - the EU is expected to provide compensation , in the form of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , for concessions which have not actually been made in the Kosovo issue .
Madam President , African governments are , of course , primarily responsible for development in their own countries .
Yet this problem is endemic in extremely poor countries .
Children are our countries &apos; future , yet EU development funds are routinely tied to population control programmes aiming at eliminating future Africans .
We should ensure that the action we take supports it .
Africa is not just a theatre for humanitarian aid , it needs to be an actor in its own development , with the European Union as a partner .
We urgently need a common position in order to eradicate cluster bombs and other cluster munitions .
In 2005 the Commission proposed that Regulation ( EC ) No 2012 / 2002 be replaced by a new Regulation on the Solidarity Fund .
And I would also ask to assist those when they are found in the Member State : to rehabilitate them and either get them back to their own countries or to make sure that they do not become criminals within the Member State in which they are trafficked .
In my opinion , that is an undeniable and positive sign .
At this meeting the following message was heavily underlined by our Heads of State and Government : firstly , that the European economy is presenting what the economists call &apos; good fundamentals &apos; , in other words our economies remain sound , and , secondly , that it supports the measures which have been taken by Ecofin and which are proposed in this area .
On that we are in absolute agreement .
It would also have very serious health and environmental repercussions .
Building a much needed railway system would help ship such goods onto the international market .
All Member States have procedures which aim to prevent this from occurring . They include attachments , injunctions , arrest and seizure : there are many different terms .
Before I arrived in this House I was a lawyer .
I must firstly stress that this report , like all other reports , is an open report : open to seeking and finding the best solutions .
Indeed , the informal European Council last week in Lisbon supported the approach proposed by the Commission to ensure that European policies are aimed at defending European citizens in a globalised economy .
I also signed an agreement with the Spanish Government to enable citizens to complain to the European Ombudsman in any of the co @-@ official languages in Spain .
It is important that we support the work of the Ombudsman , as well as the work of the Committee on Petitions , as it is through handling complaints and petitions on EU matters from citizens that we can find out what is not working well at European level and take corrective measures .
Our Union would have no raison d &apos;être or functional purpose if it did not have as its main objective to offer a fair , comprehensive and efficient service to the people of Europe .
( PL ) I would like to express my satisfaction that the European Ombudsman fulfils his functions in a balanced and dynamic manner , both in the consideration of complaints , which numbered 3830 in 2006 , and in running and completing investigations .
Welcome
This has been agreed by the PPE @-@ DE Group .
Secondly , the worrying and growing tendency to reinforce appropriations for a &apos; strong information policy &apos; in the context of the ( re ) &apos; launch &apos; of the &apos; reform &apos; Treaty and the next elections to the EP in 2009 .
in writing . - ( PL ) Mrs Martens is right to note that the basis for developing cooperation between Africa and Europe should be developing democracy and a partnership based on mutual respect .
What we can support are measures designed to unburden companies , to minimise bureaucratic and statistical obligations , to relieve companies of the requirement to publish all the bits and pieces which appear in their balance sheets but which may actually be quite unimportant .
Only recently , one of Iran &apos;s best @-@ known human rights defenders , Mr Emaddedin Baghi , was once again imprisoned under the charge of propaganda against the Government .
This is a dilemma that we cannot solve just like that .
Military operations in Africa are all very well , but there is a danger of Africa becoming a testing ground for that type of mission .
So through the support extended also under the European Development Fund for the recovery and rehabilitation of southern Sudan and for the long @-@ term equitable and sustainable development of the whole of the country , we are standing firmly behind the Comprehensive Peace Agreement .
It was my intention to direct this request to the President : that there should be a statement by the Council and the Commission on the Black Sea disaster .
Before Pirbright causes another dangerous blunder , could you please ask the Commission to take this laboratory off the list of animal testing reference laboratories and replace it with a more trustworthy facility , for agriculture &apos;s sake ?
The role of trade unions is to collectively represent the material interests of their members in the workplace , not to decide what political views are acceptable or unacceptable .
Therefore , the focus on the role of sport in education is important .
Specially trained teachers are needed here as well , so as to begin as early as possible .
This concerns a wide , distinct range of branches and activities that are based on institutions , social factors , widespread communication , the expansion of services and political responsibility .
For the Greens the entire Euratom Treaty is the bane of our lives , because it favours nuclear power over safer forms of energy .
This is a question that specifically concerns the Roma people .
With regard to the question of other European Member States , I would be grateful if you could explain the situation to me .
The answer to crime is not closing borders .
Despite the progress achieved so far , the freedom to move still lags far behind other European freedoms .
Businesses are entitled to expect consistent application of Community legislation by Member States .
We already have a Groundwater Directive and a Nitrates Directive .
The insertion of beet conditioned the soil and made it more suitable for cereals .
Recognition of the polluted areas will encourage remediation , so we can prevent the pollution of water tables for drinking water , and naturally the cultivation of polluted plants .
It is a problem where we have deforestation , and that is something that we could do something about .
Yet these measures alone are not enough ; further action is needed , and for this reason , in December 2006 , the Commission proposed that air transport should be included in the Community system for emission allowance trading .
And with this , Europe will lead the way strongly for the rest of the world .
The revenues from the action should not be transferred to the EU as proposed by Amendment 14 .
Thirdly , here in the European Parliament , we must implement a viable working relationship to achieve sensible joint solutions .
Politics often depends on symbols , and we are sending a clear signal here : it is the first legislative proposal since the Spring Summit . Thus we are beginning actively to implement climate protection .
For example , according to the highly regarded MIPS survey on the overall incidence of environmental pollution , air traffic has its own benefits and would appear to be a solution for the future .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , thank you for your constructive comments at this late hour .
Opening of the sitting
However , it is also a question of the language we use when we communicate with citizens and how we convey the message about what we are trying to do .
I am delighted at the fact that no changes can be made without the 27 governments agreeing .
The Commission , which had cooperated effectively with Parliament , managed to avoid anything that could challenge the principles of the Community system .
Even though taxation might seem a bit difficult , and we all know that it is still beyond unanimity , we must be very courageous in putting forward action in this area .
Where we do want progress is on some of the things in the programme .
Here , of course , we face a special situation : too little money and a lot of projects , especially now that the Council has announced several new projects in recent weeks .
At last the Commission is listening to what Parliament has been calling for over the last number of years .
Individual Member States have already announced that they intend to recognise Kosovo on a unilateral basis .
( Applause )
Europe cannot be a legal machine that churns out standards , regulations and directives , a machine of procedures and rules .
( Applause )
The reference to the Moldavian language remains null and void for the given Members of the European Parliament .
We also share the opinion that it is a good idea to have sports coeducation , but that is not an EU matter either .
This is crucial above all in terms of identifying areas at risk and drawing up packages of measures .
This is an especially significant point when it comes to avoiding the creation of market distortions within the European Union , albeit only for transitional periods , meaning that some operators would be at an advantage over others .
rapporteur . - ( PT ) Mr President , Mr Vice @-@ President of the Commission , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , the Schengen area is one of the greatest successes in the history of European integration .
( GA ) The EU will continue to grapple with the problems of drug imports into the EU and illicit trafficking in children , as well as addressing itself to common policy on migration , common asylum policy , EU @-@ wide police cooperation , and the fight against organised crime .
Security is an inalienable right , a natural right .
( PL ) Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking the Portuguese Government for the technical solution it proposed regarding the transitional period .
Well , this must not happen to the detriment of our neighbours , of the relationships some have mentioned : the Russian Federation , Ukraine , Moldova and the Western Balkans .
Ladies and gentlemen , let us send a clear message through information campaigns on the chance of emigrating and working legally in Europe , and a warning as to the futile risks of illegal emigration to prevent thousands of young people from falling into the hands of mafias and risking their lives in ramshackle boats or canoes .
It ranges from help towards self @-@ help in the fields of security , trade and good governance to stabilisation programmes , including assistance to combat crime , the creation of training places and jobs , the offer of microcredits , and information campaigns about the opportunities for legal forms of migration and all the consequences of illegal migration and measures to combat it .
The Council has been listening and the working group last Friday unanimously confirmed the full substance of our proposal .
The Danes voted against Maastricht , the Irish voted against Nice , the Swedes against the euro , the French and Dutch against the Constitution , yet their taxes will be used to promote integration .
This is exactly the idea behind giving all the political parties the possibility of forming and contributing to the European political foundation , to have a lively debate where both sides and all the different views can be expressed .
This includes Latin America , which has benefited from the URB @-@ AL Programme , and Asia , which has its own Asia Urbs Programme .
I and my fellow Vice @-@ Presidents who have responsibility for Question Time are always open to ways in which we can improve it and do better , hence the step that we have taken already of inviting Members to come to the front of the Chamber .
However , the question is this : what if there is no resolution ?
This Personal Data Directive remains in force .
To ensure that this contest did not spill over into a competition to secure the largest share of State aid , a groundbreaking agreement was forged early on , in 1992 .
I naturally cannot speak for Commissioner Mandelson , but I can say that it takes two to have amicable negotiations in this case .
I fully support the suggestion to enhance the visibility of the Citizens &apos; Portal in relation to the right to petition .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I requested this report after I made the following discovery : although earthquakes in the 20th century have killed 1.5 million people worldwide and injured many more ; although earthquakes are the second most deadly natural disaster in the world ; and although in 2002 @-@ 2007 , earthquakes were the fourth most frequent natural disaster in the Member States and the candidate countries , we in the EU responded to the problem only occasionally and peripherally , and only in the context of other natural disasters .
This will permit the funding of vital research programmes and also allow the repair of damage , wherever this can humanly and fairly be achieved .
It is evident that international humanitarian law is designed precisely for times of war .
Whenever possible , we endeavour to assist in finding appropriate political solutions through which to eliminate the aforementioned reasons .
Let me give a concrete example which the Commissioner knows well .
The challenge is to preserve and strengthen what we have achieved in that time and to find ways of defending our interests and projecting our common values beyond our borders .
Analysis and feedback from Member States show that the guidelines are working .
On the left , Kurt Beck and his friends are holding back much needed reforms .
( CS ) ( The beginning of the speech was inaudible ) ... to make an effort so that Europe is as strong a player as possible on the world market .
While I realise it is extremely hard to push these issues to the top of international agendas , I believe that if we fail or refuse to do so we will inflict damage on our own international policies .
What the citizens of Europe expect are effective reforms to boost employment and support them through changing times .
Non @-@ tariff barriers and other obstacles to trade are unacceptable .
It cannot be emphasised too strongly that Europe &apos;s strength lies in an internal market that is a springboard for our companies globally .
( PL ) Madam President , Mr President , it is obvious that we will not be able to solve all the problems of globalisation with one statement and one measure to promote the Lisbon Strategy .
On the other hand , I am advocating a responsible approach in the area of work permits for legal migrants : we must think about it properly and we must choose qualified employees for the employment sectors most in need .
It is time to stop considering policies in isolation .
8 . Life assurance ( implementing powers conferred on the Commission ) ( vote )
I would like to thank the rapporteur and confirm once again my approval of this important document .
Where I come from , people like that are called Dampfplauderer - patter merchants .
But it is irresponsible to reject , delay or limit the soil protection package in the way the largest group in Parliament is proposing .
The Russian KGB regime is seeking legitimacy .
There have been calls to suspend or review our aid to Pakistan , and some EU Member States have taken steps or are considering some action in this respect .
President Musharraf justifies his actions as an attempt to stop the country from committing suicide , but it is not that the country is committing suicide but that the actions and deeds of a dictator are killing the country .
It took a leading role on the international scene and a constructive position with regard to our main partners among developed and developing countries .
I also want to congratulate Al Gore , the former Vice @-@ President of America , for being recently awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his sterling work in highlighting the need for international action to arrest climate change .
All this demonstrates that we cannot rest on our laurels if Europe is to retain its global influence .
Some of those suggestions were referred to here by Mrs Ferreira , and the Council will certainly bear the recommendations in mind .
Funding will be allocated via this facility for the first time this autumn .
I am being told that the Presidency of the Council had not been informed that the debate was a joint debate on the European Neighbourhood Policy and the situation in Georgia .
They do not want to make it easier for people to come to Britain : they want to make it harder .
Keep it up , Commissioner .
Energy security , immigration and counter @-@ terrorism are all core issues .
From now on , we expect that all the necessary conditions for free and fair elections will be met .
I am thinking of doctors and nurses from Malawi who are in the UK , for example .
On 14 @-@ 15 December 2006 the European Council reiterated that each country &apos;s progress towards the Union would continue to depend on its efforts to comply with the Copenhagen criteria and the conditionality of the Stabilisation and Association Process .
The economy should be an instrument to bring good living conditions to the citizens , and this objective can be achieved by raising living standards , improving working conditions , through good education , a good justice system , including ownership rights .
If you look at certain areas , such as economic policy , the OECD report paints a truly encouraging picture .
On the other hand , all the products that they could produce avoiding the animal welfare provisions would come back into the European Union , and as the River Tisza flows from Ukraine into Hungary , we in Hungary will have to face environmental protection problems too .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , although I share the view that this recovery plan is not as ambitious as it should be , the truth is that it is the result of a hard @-@ won compromise at the ICCAT and I believe that by approving it we are taking a huge step forward and for the first time sending a very clear message to the persons responsible for the over @-@ fishing of this species .
Obviously , in the society we live in , data collection has become an essential tool of analysis .
The fight against piracy must therefore be included among the Commission &apos;s initial aims in the possible legislative proposal on collective management of copyright .
In this particular case , the essential message of our resolution can be summed up in one sentence and should attract support from everyone , beyond the political divisions .
The unemployment rate has fallen to approximately 7 % .
Then we will be able to win the support of our citizens and perhaps start to feel that we are working for them .
Today , in the 21st century , the level of poverty and social exclusion in Europe are worryingly high .
I do thank Commissioner Špidla for putting a firm commitment in the Commission &apos;s work programme for new legislation on Article 13 discrimination , which I have long discussed with him .
This Parliament will express itself with a majority and has every right to criticise or censure the Commissioners .
( CS ) Mr President , allow me to speak about the report by my colleague Mr Carlos Coelho on the draft Council decision on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the nine Member States that joined the EU in 2004 .

Research funds for decreasing the quantity of waste and increasing the security of installations are required .
We are anxious that European competences should not be extended in this sphere and that countries should not be pressured to adopt policies that could be unhelpful to their well @-@ being in economic and social terms .
This is indeed a very sad state of affairs , which involves a range of countries or regions worldwide - some of them have already been mentioned in this Chamber today - but it is more specific in the Middle East .
There are three ways in which we can act .
However , torture is still used in Uzbek prisons ; the human rights situation in Uzbekistan has not improved at all .
We also make a call for protection of freedom of the press by strongly condemning the Somali Government &apos;s systematic harassment of the media and its shameful failure to investigate the killing of journalists whose reporting was deemed to be critical of the government .
We have also tried very hard to work out a compromise resolution with other groups , with a view to reaching such a compromise .
This was not obvious at the outset and it has been a long road to achieving this goal fully .
Does the right to take industrial action also apply to public sector employees ?
Will the European Union , which possesses a legal personality , have a separate judge in the European Court of Human Rights ?
Mr President , I believe that , with the exception of these few reservations , the report is a useful , relevant contribution to the discussion about flexicurity , and once again I would like to thank the European Parliament for it .
This report sets out ways in which that can change .
It goes without saying that Europe must be equal to the challenges of globalisation and competition - not always fair competition - forced upon us by the world economy .
( Applause )
Development of the necessary civil and military capabilities , European Union Battlegroups , rapid response force initiatives and European Defence Agency programmes constitute important advances which are , however , still inadequate .
( Applause )
I will give two examples .
This coexistence means integration and absolute and total intolerance of any signs of racism and xenophobia .
Therefore Parliament will be deciding double the amount of legislation that it does today . Moreover , the European Parliament will elect the President of the European Commission who will have to report to the European Parliament on each of his discussions in the European Council .
It is time to dismantle the supranational political structures of the EU and return to the simple trading group which the British were promised in 1972 .
Without this , we can only offer the generalised system of preferences .
Competition , a good climate for investment , market access , and working factories are essential for economic growth in ACP countries .
The aim is , through this directive , to set out the new regulatory framework emerging from the Community directives on the opening up of the market and from the new contract on the use of wagons implemented on an international scale by the COTIF Convention .
We must facilitate administrative procedures , reduce time @-@ limits and do all we can to harmonise national safety regulations , which sometimes lead to major traffic restrictions for no good reason .
The result : an efficient , safe , quality service in response to passengers &apos; needs .
Member of the Commission . - ( FR ) Mr President , it is always a great satisfaction for a mother to see the child she brought into the world grow up into an intelligent lively teenager .
As before , cinematographic works and news programmes will not be interrupted .
( PL ) Mr President , Polish fishermen demonstrated in front of the European Commission &apos;s headquarters in Brussels yesterday .
It is also important that imitation and converted weapons should be covered under the directive .
Mr President , with time to make only one point , I want to draw attention to the unequal way in which the European firearms pass operates in practice , particularly as it affects the hunting fraternity .
The report submitted to us today brings this need to light .
( PT ) While we accept and value many of the aspects covered by this report , we must intervene in this debate to stress , firstly , that tourist activity and high @-@ quality tourism require the professions involved in this sector to be governed by legal regimes which protect labour rights and promote quality jobs and worker qualification .
However , we obviously did want to ensure full respect for the competence of Parliament as an arm of the budgetary authority , maximum clarity and transparency as the rapporteur was proposing , and therefore correct and effective use of the funding , thus avoiding any kind of corruption , as indicated by Commissioner Verheugen in his speech .
Our excellent opinion gives us an opportunity to take concrete measures to deal with this .
I am therefore expressing , on my own account , my concern about this particular problem .
I feel , however , that , first and foremost and above all , we ought to respect the decision of the Venezuelan people .
The Court said that our 2006 accounts are true and fair in all material respects , except for certain small overstatements , comprising 0.13 % of operating expenditure .
When I hear , out in the field , how hard it is to obtain money from the Structural Funds , I find it scarcely credible that the controls are not adequate , because more and more I am hearing people say &apos; someone else can have my share - it is far too complicated being involved with the Funds &apos; .
My second point concerns the policies , and firstly the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) .
The Commission wishes to make the procedures stricter and impose penalties for tender irregularities , often without objective reasons .
The next item is the joint debate of seven reports from Mrs Ayala Sender , of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the proposed nomination of David Bostock , Michel Cretin , Maarten B. Engwirda , Henri Grethen , Harald Noack , Ioannis Sarmas and Hubert Weber as Members of the Court of Auditors .
This is why this instrument , which lays down uniform rules on the law applicable , is so important .
13 . Amendment of Directive 2004 / 49 / EC on safety on the Community &apos;s railways ( vote )
When it comes to fundamental rights and freedoms , the EU must be able to speak with one voice , both at home and abroad .
I am in favour of Europe as a confederation of free nations and consequently I voted against this report on fundamental rights , without , of course , being opposed to fundamental basic rights per se .
In addition , tracing firearms is of the greatest importance in the fight against organised crime .
This is an important issue for animal and human health .
It is also a slide towards the uniform language used by an elite which has no homeland , no faith and no laws , and its propaganda machines .
Sustainable tourism is essential as a basis for the development and continuation of tourist activities and is a crucial factor in the preservation and enhancement of our natural and cultural heritage .
( The sitting was closed at 12.20 p.m. )
The substance used to kill him , polonium @-@ 210 , is strictly controlled and is easily traceable back to its source in Russia , even down to the original batch from whence it came .
The elections revealed that there is no longer any place for an opposition in Russia .
The pharmaceutical policy has been a source of serious concern in Bulgaria for the last few years .
The Commission is pleased that it was possible to reach an agreement at second reading .
Climate changes , waste , fishing activities , acoustic , biological and chemical factors threaten maritime waters and this directive represents an important step toward improving the integrity of ecosystems and preserving biodiversity .
The significance of the introduction of a new , legally binding exposure concentration already in 2015 cannot be overstated .
The European Union , often at the forefront of environmental regulations , was a great disappointment at the first reading , to the point that our Environment Commissioner Mr Dimas was personally outraged at the position of the European Parliament , which was weakening legislation in force that already had few teeth .
However , we have a multitude of solutions at our fingertips for better air quality , such as action on fuels , on modes of transport and on vehicles .
in writing . - ( FI ) Today we are discussing at second reading two important directives on improving the quality of the environment .
Regular statistical studies looking at family , social , economic and residential characteristics are undoubtedly needed in view of the demographic and social problems Europe faces .
It is very important that we allow Member States to use the opportunity of a European census to ask questions that are relevant to their own nation and to collate those questions separately from the shared questions or the exclusively European ones .
I welcome the commitment from the industry to work on measures to build consumer confidence .
We shall be banning them in car tyres , but they are permitted in toys even though these are carcinogenic substances .
One set concerns requirements on toys as industrial goods , and the other one , over and above those efforts , concerns checks at any given point on how safe the toys are for our children .
The Commission fully understands that Parliament wants to be kept informed of , and involved in , the ongoing work on the CFR .
Earlier we were given figures for the safety of hotels and other types of safety and , though every human life is very important , these were quite low numbers .
Dutch and other banks and pension funds are guilty of this .
It is thus essential , Commissioner , for designations of origin and geographical indications , which embody the quality of European wine @-@ growing , to be well protected .
When you speak of enrichment with grape must or sugar and say that there must be a shift in the balance between these two methods , that is fine by us , because it basically means that chaptalisation will remain legal .
Biodiversity of terroirs , cultures and tastes , development and promotion of quality , and the extraordinary richness of European vines : these are the future and the principles that ought to form the basis of this reform .
Of course , the EU &apos;s wine market needs to be reformed , but let us do it sensibly .
Thirdly , the de minimis level should be increased to 50 000 hectolitres , for example .
They provide a guarantee for control of production and continued quality .
I also welcome the adaptation measures for the new Member States .
This breach of the guarantee is , to my mind , unacceptable because farmers have entered into set @-@ aside arrangements for those years and it would not be right to go back on them .
16 . Draft amending budget No 7 / 2007 ( vote )
Darfur is not the only region of Sudan which suffers from abuses of human rights .
( SK ) The Innovative Medicines Initiative is a unique initiative instigated by the European Commission and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations , which will have a budget of EUR 2 billion to 2013 .
Moreover , in my opinion , we should involve Russia in the development and implementation of this framework .
However , we agree with the need for more information in the agricultural sector so that this can adapt to the cross @-@ compliance rules .
As regards the general reserve for EUR 5 million on staff salaries , the Commission is firmly committed to delivering the required study on the ABM implementation and the reports requested by Parliament on the follow @-@ up or the screening exercise and on the implementation of Article 44 of the Interinstitutional Agreement .
Roughly half is still spent in practice on the agricultural policy and a further quarter to a third on something called &apos; the structural funds on the structural side &apos; .
In that way we can achieve not only better access to information but also more transparency and a better use of resources .
Simply put , the European Union shows that it can provide Community solutions to large @-@ scale , complex problems where others have failed .
The last year has seen a considerable increase in the number of human rights dialogues .
What we are trying to do is speed up the transformation of citizens who control their own future into mere consumers , passive service @-@ providers , and we could not do this any better .
In China , organs are taken from political prisoners .
In the Europe of today , with 27 Member States , there are very diverse external policy priorities and approaches .
Not much , no , and in fact nearly not at all , because some of us here had to write to remind you that it was not on the agenda , and that it was a disgrace that Africa and Europe should meet up and not discuss Darfur .
However , those who have listened to the Presidency and the Commission will believe that this was a genuinely historic event , a moment with a before and an after , which is clearly an exaggeration .
You will understand why the Portuguese Presidency is delighted at this event and this initiative which we shared together .
Pardon me , but that is simplifying things too much .
( DE ) Mr Vice @-@ President , you have just about answered my supplementary question already , but since nothing is as clear as a clear statement in our mother tongue , I would be very pleased to hear you repeat in German what you said before about the Commission not seeking to act as Europe &apos;s supreme planning authority by interfering in every area , particularly by imposing or recommending a specific development model .
The work on a new test cycle is now finalised .
The issue of South Stream is very clear @-@ cut .
For companies , the fines are also imposed according to national legislation if this is violated .
Cabin crew perform a major safety function .
I do not believe that any of the parties involved would like to see the demise of this promising and developing sector , which has several dozen small and medium @-@ sized enterprises operating within it .
I particularly wish to thank Parliament .
This burden is more than doubled , according to numerous studies that have already appeared , by external costs .
This list can be reviewed every two years , whereas the programmes themselves may only be submitted once a year .
We should start with young people and educational institutions .
Repair parts , in other words , parts which have broken or come loose after an accident or for any other reason , have to be replaced and , as Commissioner McCreevy said , the normal format is a part equivalent to the part replaced .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to express my fundamental disagreement with the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98 / 71 / EC on the legal protection of designs .
Thirdly and finally , the full implementation of the repair clause should result in falling car insurance premiums .
Today , when we in Europe speak about globalisation , many people think , above all , of the growing , emerging economic powers in Asia .
There were no doubt reasons for the rejection of the draft constitution by extremists on both sides .
Yesterday the Danish Parliament refused a referendum on a Treaty they have not read .
Europe is a sham democracy .
I would also request the Chairman of the Council of Europe to ask the present prime ministers of Poland and the United Kingdom why they are not honouring the signatures of their predecessors .
I will single out three .
Following enlargement in 2004 and the admission of Bulgaria and Romania - i.e. with 27 Member States - the Union functioned on the basis of the Treaty of Nice .
The reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6 of the Treaty of Lisbon , which the Heads of State or Government will be signing tomorrow , lends the Charter the same legally binding character that the Treaties themselves possess .
The 54 articles cover rights that until now had to be recognised by the Court of Justice on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis .
And Europe has been an important partner , through private @-@ sector investments , as well as official assistance .
As to what happened here , it is only the freedom of expression which every Member of this Parliament has .
I do not doubt the fundamental goals , rather the manner in which they are being achieved .
The consequences will be felt mainly in the distribution of agricultural products , both to third countries and to EU countries , since import duties and internal aid for Community agriculture will be drastically reduced at the same time .
We are also opposed to the proposals which advocate the use of European taxpayers &apos; money to market wines in third countries .
I voted to maintain this tradition and for an open market .
Membership of political groups : see Minutes
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( FR ) Madam President , we are talking today to Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner , and that is welcome .
We understand that , by becoming the host of the Beijing Olympics , the Chinese Government committed itself to fully respect both the Olympic ideal of human dignity and internationally guaranteed human rights .
Think of those awful manifestations of racism : at sports events , during football matches where people take the opportunity to shout neo @-@ Nazi slogans , those are the kinds of act that the framework decision - which we genuinely wanted and which we agreed with the German Presidency - will punish .
How can you say that and sit in a House where you claim to be democrats ?

Mr President , we are seeing in Europe a constant increase in extremist , nationalist and populist movements that endanger our democratic system .
Secondly , we must remember the involvement of citizens in the political process .
It is for those reasons that repressive action is justified , and there can be no talk of censure or of violation of the freedom of expression .
Montenegro must now focus on implementing all the measures needed to complete the reform process which is already under way in order to fulfil the commitments into which it has entered in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , in 1918 independent Montenegro took a voluntary decision to unite with the neighbouring states of Serbia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , and Slovenia .

I would , however , refer briefly to areas in which , as set out in the Commission &apos;s recommendations , Montenegro must continue its efforts if it wishes to draw closer to the European Union .
The Portuguese Presidency has given solid backing to our campaign and we hope for a positive endorsement from Commissioner Kovács too when he launches the debate on the European VAT system at the end of next year .
Shipping disaster in the Sea of Asov / Black Sea and the subsequent oil pollution ( debate )
The 11 November 2007 black tide tragedy has proved to us that , in this field , we need to combine our efforts .
I have noted the suggestion that the EFDI participate in general burden @-@ sharing discussions .
The debate is closed .
Greedy bank executives , focused solely on shareholder value , still enjoy celebrity status , and the US rating agencies continue to do a roaring trade and to lead us up the garden path .
I have concerns regarding any call for a depository passport that would result in the depository being established in a different state from that of the UCITS .
Secondly , I welcome the intention to consolidate cooperation in the specific human rights protection projects launched by the Council of Europe .
The differences in the substantive law of the Member States , under the vital heading of justice , remain .
The problem with your proposal , of course , is that you are drawing more and more decision @-@ making into the realm of comitology , just as you did with the old regulation of 17 December 2003 , in which the provisions and application arrangements relating to the regime of electronic identification were delegated to the Commission through the comitology procedure .
Since the principle had already been adopted , we thought that this technical question could be adopted through comitology and , to repeat what I said earlier , we have no problem in accepting the amendment setting a specific date , which I believe allows Member States enough time - two years - to prepare .
In view of situations like this in international trade , we should not be afraid , provided that the legal and economic requirements are met , to use the legitimate instruments available , which have been put in place by multilateral international agreements to protect and safeguard the textile industry , specifically to counterbalance the potential negative effects of the ending of quotas .
One of the things that he mentioned was the situation with Euromed , which has a specific relevance to textiles and , of course , is very important for the stability of the whole European / Mediterranean region .
In addition , many producer regions are suffering the consequences of economic restructuring , so that it is difficult to achieve sustainability in the sector .
I believe this is an important free trade agreement .
The EU @-@ Korea Treaty will be the first application of the new EU trade doctrine Global Europe , a doctrine that is highly controversial , not least because it seeks such deep market access conditions through the removal of all kinds of barriers to all @-@ out import penetration , precisely at a time when more and more people are becoming aware that there are very many losers as well as some winners in a completely liberalised global economy .
I am of course referring to that historic event - the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon - due to take place in just over an hour in my country &apos;s capital .
I was in the chamber at nine o &apos;clock this morning awaiting an apology for the personal attack on the ushers .
Any changes in costs must be primarily absorbed by reducing other budget lines .
In 1918 , independent Montenegro voluntarily chose unification with the neighbouring countries of Serbia , Croatia , Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina and Slovenia .
Does that mean we will have the privilege of unlimited use of time this afternoon , or is there a technical error ?
With these funds , measures will be financed in the following three key areas , which extend from emergency aid to long @-@ term development aid .
In Saudi Arabia , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old woman fell victim to gang rape but was herself convicted .
I refer to the officially commissioned acquisition of young women by the Government of Japan , from the 1930s and during the Second World War , for the sole purpose of sexual servitude to the Japanese Imperial Armed Forces .
As I had the opportunity to say here in the session launching the Portuguese Presidency , they were always the three main priorities of the Portuguese Presidency , right from the beginning .
At the same time , during this period and specifically in these six months , we have seen the European Union taking a lead on policies that affect every European every day : economic growth and job creation , climate change , energy , migration and innovation .
That is what is needed in Kosovo today to keep the peace .
And that sets out more guidelines and the way forward that we want to see happening .
I do not mean to steal anyone else &apos;s thunder , as others deserve credit too , but were it not for his and our determination we would not today have the Treaty of Lisbon , were it not for his and our determination we would not have had the Brazil summit , nor the Africa summit .
Where QMV can be deployed but is not - such as the Working Time Directive - decisions are missed , compromises do not emerge and no progress is made .
We must not split the European camp .
As I said in an email addressed to you and copied to other Members this morning , another regrettable fact is that it seems that you have made the Grand Mufti comparable to the Pope and the UK Chief Rabbi as a European representative of his particular religion .
Together with the complex economic and political problems faced by this friendly nation , there is still an institutional vacuum , because since 23 November 2007 it has not been possible for its parliament to elect a president ; this election has been postponed 12 times .
( PL ) Mr President , for the period 2008 @-@ 2012 the European Commission has allocated Poland the right to emit only 208 million tonnes of carbon dioxide .
CARS 21 stands for Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st Century .
Most especially , it is necessary to support those who want to start their own business - I have in mind the Globalisation Fund .
This concerns in particular the matter of emissions reduction in the automotive industry .
It is clear that both the car manufacturers and consumers have finally been convinced of the urgent need for a change of course .
On the other hand , we have to improve the information available to purchasers , update and extend the labelling system for light trucks , harmonise energy efficiency classes and propose annual running costs .
We shall be voting against it and I shall now explain why .
At the same time it is vital to ensure that there will be no undue restrictions to the Treaty freedoms .
This proposal for a directive seeks primarily to transpose into Community legislation the principles that the Member States have already approved within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation : non @-@ discrimination , transparency , consultation .
I say this to the Commission : if the genuine reason for this directive is to tackle the abuse of dominant position in the market , then why does it include regional airports at all , when they are not the problem ?
Amendments 9 and 16 take account of the existence of an airport network , but small airports are treated unfairly .
The appropriate enforcement of these procedures will be ensured by the establishment of an independent national regulatory authority in each Member State .
Finally we have legislation which is acceptable and improves on the Commission &apos;s proposal but could have been even better if public health and the environment had taken precedence over corporate interests ; that is after all the only sustainable economic model .
We need a framework directive on musculoskeletal disorders to address a problem such as lower back pain - repetitive strain injuries , effectively - and lower back disorders .
It was only later that it emerged that the factory did not comply with safety regulations !
First and foremost , however , the increasing pressure to perform which characterises the contemporary workplace creates not only physical problems but psychological problems too .
A good example of this is the first proposed amendment , where in Hungarian law the concept of &apos; close dependant &apos; was amended in the Civil Code , and now an opportunity has opened up for us to adjust the European wording to this .
( BG ) Mr. President , distinguished colleagues .
The task is to vote to support an agreement today on credit rules that will provide real added value to Europe &apos;s citizens in that space where they lead their lives and to send a clear signal of Europe &apos;s willingness to roll up our sleeves and work in an area that greatly concerns our citizens and businesses , large and small , today .
My group regards this purely and simply as an unacceptable state of affairs , which is why we must ensure that a fair balance is struck between the natural right of the banks to do business - a normal feature of any market economy - and the need to protect consumers by ensuring that they are given the information they need to choose the right form of credit and reject unfavourable options .
The uniform annual percentage rate of charges certainly represents unmitigated progress , as does the common uniform right of withdrawal .
Tolerance is at the heart of intercultural dialogue .
Do not use religion for killing ; religion is for peace and life .
Moreover , as you said yourself , the House is sovereign .
So let me finish and let me listen - arguably the most important thing and one of the most difficult things to do in politics .
The multiannual framework programme is crucial for the Agency &apos;s work and for how effective it will be in monitoring fundamental rights and formulating what to do .
The next European Forum on the rights of the child , which will take place under the Slovenian Presidency , will address other subjects , including in particular international adoptions .
It strikes me that in our strategy on the rights of the child , greater attention should be focused on safeguarding disabled children &apos;s rights ; and that also they , like other target groups , should have genuinely guaranteed opportunities , equal opportunities , to be actively involved in the life of society .
Children &apos;s rights are acknowledged in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
This must also be done to prevent crimes against children and the exploitation of children .
The PSE Group would like a separate vote on amendment 127 .
The proposal in the report , for example , to create a uniform classification and labelling system in the EU for the sale and distribution of audiovisual content and video games intended for minors is a worthy one .
This is not the moment for those who bear primary responsibility and are to blame for the entire policy to evade or deny it .
Separate collections are made in Italy and the rest of Europe .
This provision is expected to become an important tool in the fight against spam in Europe .
It is interesting that when food prices are rising , the Commission will act to look at it and I would urge the Commission to come up with statistics that show us the share @-@ out of the final retail price between producer - and I mean farmers - and consumer , because that information is not available .
I should just like to ask the Commissioner - with regard to the rule of subsidiarity , and in particular the issue of planning permission - is this an area that the Commission should be involved in , when the operation of planning and the right to build a property is separate from the right to own property and exploit that property ?
The special needs of migrants must also be taken into account , which brings me to the subject of language courses .
Adults must adapt to the continuous change imposed by globalisation and take decisions in order to be able to survive while maintaining an adequate quality of life .
Acquiring knowledge means enjoying life more fully .
Commission measures in 2008 @-@ 2013 to make use of CAP remote @-@ sensing applications ( debate )
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to support the view taken by the rapporteur and emphasise that remote @-@ sensing techniques can be useful to the European Commission : first of all , in helping to manage agricultural markets , secondly , by making it possible to monitor cultivation and at the same time to forecast harvests , and thirdly and finally , this forecasting should have an impact on the prices of agricultural raw materials , which will be particularly important in the next few years , in a situation where the prices of foodstuffs are constantly rising .
As Members of the European Parliament , Polish MEPs represent not only the Poles but also all Europeans .
in writing . - ( SV ) The Commission proposals contain a long list of detailed rules on how airport charges should be collected .
The introduction of the new regulations should be preceded by drawing up guidelines concerning the use of computer products and documentation and providing training in accordance with EU standards , particularly for the new Member States .
Should the car industry decide to move to low wage countries , they will do this nonetheless .
Accidents at work are the heavy price the working class is made to pay , within the scope of the barbarous spread of capitalism , all for the sake of profit .
The triangular institutional partnership between Parliament , the Slovenian Presidency of the Council and the Commission will be crucial to our success in 2008 .
In other areas , you will have to flex your muscles a great deal more - particularly with your presidential counterparts who have a vested interest in promoting nuclear energy as the panacea of climate change .
( Applause )
Christian culture and religion , as Professor Tadeusz Zieliński , buried in Schöndorf near Munich , used to say , is expressed in human longing .
We would like to know about the Slovenian Government &apos;s proposals and ideas , the form the negotiations should take and the intended result .
It took decisions such as sending a civilian mission , but apparently with no agreement on the legal basis .
As holder of the Presidency , your fundamental task is to give a strong impetus to the process of ratifying the Lisbon Treaty .

Of course we consider that it would be unacceptable to use funding from European Union funds for relocation inside the European Union .
I hope that by its actions the Slovenian Presidency can convince 500 million European citizens that even a small country with 2 million people is capable of successful leadership of the EU during its six @-@ month presidency .
If anybody tries to speak about anything else , I am afraid I will stop your speech , in accordance with the Rules .
The amount of credit taken across borders is not sufficient to justify harmonisation , but may I suggest that the European Union itself is running out of credit with citizens because it refuses to take the necessary action , through referendums , to legitimise itself ?
- ( DE ) Madam President , Mrs Pack &apos;s report on &apos; Adult Education : It is never to late to learn &apos; is in my opinion one of the most important programmes of action in the European Union : the motivation to take part in adult education programmes , the learning of foreign languages , the motivation to complete tertiary education and with it the chance of having better job opportunities and therefore a better income , as well as the opportunity for better integration of immigrants .
I understand , for example , the rapporteur &apos;s concern over the impossibility of comparing data between different Member States owing to the different frequency of analyses .
I feel that the compromise reached during successive negotiations is satisfactory .
Its Article 24 deals expressly with the rights of the child .
These irregularities are causing serious doubts about the actual outcome of these elections .
To the end means until our final report , which we are presently compiling , is submitted .
The concept , as Mrs Kinnock rightly says , of good governance and respect for democracy are prerequisites for European Union aid .
I think it would be desirable for the parties to reach an agreement .
We cannot , however , ignore the fact , as pointed out by Mr Díaz de Mera García , that meanwhile the context has changed : the signing of the Lisbon Treaty creates the prospect that in the near future police cooperation will be subject to co @-@ decision by the European Parliament and thus to our full responsibility , to qualified majority voting in Council and to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice .
From a liberal point of view , this is a gigantic step forward . We no longer need to stand with cap in hand in front of officials when we want to study , work , travel or seek health care in another EU country .
The Treaty of Lisbon has not yet come into force .
President Musharraf spoke of the need for national reconciliation when he addressed the nation on 2 January .
Her absence among the candidates calls the legitimacy of the forthcoming elections into question .
I was referring to the Indian State and the Pakistani State and the governments of both countries - not the peoples of the countries or the people of descent of those countries who live within the Member States of the European Union .
Does Slovenia have any experience of this ?
The Council is also planning to take full advantage of the existing instruments of the European Neighbourhood Policy .
In it we refer to human dignity and the ban on degrading and cruel punishment .
In this framework I may express myself only as a representative of the Council - and I am not being diplomatic here , but speaking within the limits of my competences and the competences of the Council , and of course out of respect for the movements within these frameworks .
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this morning the report on an EU strategy on the rights of the child was adopted .
It is not , however , just a funding problem .
Money must be given to the Member State , but everything be decided at local level .
The Black Sea region arguably is of strategic importance for the security and diversification of energy supply in the European Union and requires a comprehensive approach with that in mind .
We have been saying this for years , only nothing is ever done about it .
Extending the European Neighbourhood Policy to Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia is an important step forward in the Union &apos;s engagement with the region .
Now at last we have come to understand that Azerbaijan , Armenia and Georgia are not a natural zone for the economic and political influences of Russia .
( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , please allow me in my short speech to concentrate on just one of the aspects of today &apos;s topics , which is regional cooperation .
Apart from the geopolitical situation , however , another cause of friction with Russia is , objectively , the oil and gas pipelines in Georgian territory , designed to carry Azerbaijan &apos;s oil and gas westwards .
Agenda for next sitting : see Minutes
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( FI ) Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and levels of cooperation , and , in particular , for highlighting the way men and women are treated differently , despite the fact that we hardly ever get a sympathetic hearing .
I would like to ask you to see to it that the conditions are improved .
There might be one or two paragraphs that I have to think about , but I will be supporting her report , and I think it behoves all of us in the House to support a very good report on which an awful lot of work has been done .
Women have the highest potential to accelerate the development of our high @-@ tech industry .
Madam President , I would like to throw some light on one particular aspect today .
So , the EU could actually learn a lot from London and how it has ensured human rights and that people &apos;s dignity is respected .
One of the things that they welcome about living in London is democracy and the right to have their say on vital issues .
in writing . - ( FR ) I strongly support the report by our excellent colleague Mr Díaz de Mera .
Above all , what we are concerned with is equality of opportunity , which is conditional on access to education and professional training in technical and economic subjects .
The hope that the IOC decision would help improve things in the Middle Kingdom has been an illusion .
We sincerely hope that the Chinese authorities will understand that the issue of human rights defenders has an important impact on China &apos;s standing with the European public and will act accordingly .
The trauma of rape is aggravated by the fact that many of the victims then suffer social discrimination and ostracism by their families and communities .
author . - ( CS ) Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Egypt is without doubt the most notable of the Arab countries .
We believe we have reason to be proud of it .
In addition to our mutual solidarity , the geographical and economical capacity of the Member States must be the primary consideration when dividing up the cost .
To this extent , waivers in sectors such as iron and steel would be a big mistake .
We certainly must work hard to determine commitments and outcomes and give greater weight to the package presented to us .
( DE ) Madam President , as long as energy @-@ hungry emerging economies and energy @-@ wasting industrialised nations do not turn more of their attention to the environment , all the efforts of the EU will not even suffice to make good the damage those countries have done .
And while remaining competitive is ever pressing , we cannot solve our numbers and targets by exporting jobs through relocation to regions which have no legislation to reduce greenhouse gases ...
New correction coefficients are needed to reflect the differences in the investment potential of countries with a similar GDP but with dissimilar social and economic prospects .
I doubt whether one of those that you have called - Ms Sinnott from our group - has ever shouted at anybody in her life .
In the current phase with Dr ElBaradei , as you know , Iran has to answer questions about important issues like weaponisation , and especially other issues related to contamination , which are very important .

However , that is not enough .
Examples of this are the recent resolutions on Pakistan and China , which were not nearly as strong in tone , nor was there such evident support for the internal opposition .
Iran &apos;s judges routinely pass death sentences on homosexuals and teenagers .
We had the EU BAM for Rafah there for a long time , but unfortunately in recent months they have not been able to do anything , so perhaps there is a chance for us Europeans to take this up again and to try to reach some sort of solution .
But , on the other hand , it simplifies it .
Earlier in the week , only a few hours after the tension erupted , the Arab League met .
We expect NATO &apos;s Bucharest summit in April to present proposals for a joint system , and we expect these proposals to take due account of our specific European security interests .
Three quarters of the citizens of the Czech Republic want a referendum on the subject .
Discussing this matter was an extremely demanding task for the German and especially Portuguese Presidencies in 2007 .
Since the 1990s a political majority have tried to create ever broader scope for such companies , and this proposed decision gives them almost an entirely free hand .
I also have reason to believe that increasing numbers of people disagree with that approach .
Initially , I have to say I had some reservations about the impact on postal workers , but Member States still have the authority to regulate employment conditions and collective bargaining in the sector , where this does not lead to unfair competition .
Nor will businesses be the only beneficiaries , for consumers will reap great benefits too .
Let us use this opportunity to bring our partners closer and to demonstrate that ambition is not inconsistent with economic development or competitiveness .
Let us hear less about wind farms and auto emissions and more about investment in nuclear generating capacity and in waste @-@ to @-@ energy incinerators .
It was competent , unified and very dynamic .
The UN has declared 2008 the International Year of Planet Earth .
Within the scope of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change the creation of a new ad hoc group has been approved to negotiate long @-@ term cooperation , together with an ad hoc working group already operating under the Kyoto Protocol .
We have already come to an agreement , after all , on the water regime in the entire Danube region .
If the policies described are to be credible , we need to match actions to words .
Institutional care is often of unacceptably poor quality .
The report also highlights the global scale of the problem and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions .
All standards and the country will benefit .
Reduction in unwanted by @-@ catches and elimination of discards in European fisheries ( debate )
I should also like to ask the Commission ensure that small fishermen do not incur any additional cost on account of measures to resolve the problem of these discards .
Yes , Commissioner , clearly there are many reasons why fish are thrown overboard , but I still think that this has been exacerbated by aspects of our fisheries policy .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , because of Hungary &apos;s special situation , it is particularly important for us to promote the practical application of cross @-@ border cooperation .
But , of course , the EGGC can receive Community funding according to the normal rules , under the European cohesion policy .
We will be proposing a European strategy for the prevention of violent radicalisation , one of the key factors of a political strategy to fight terrorism ; this will happen in June .
I think that a genuine assessment must be made of the usefulness and effectiveness of Frontex .
It will be no surprise to you that I am coming back to this .
I think this is the way to find an appropriate form of cooperation to ensure adequate security and a sufficiently effective method of operation and to lay down future working practices .
I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr França , for his fine work .
( Parliament rejected Mr Farage &apos;s request for the vote to be adjourned ) .
I am speaking here on my own behalf , and also on behalf of Mr Czarnecki and Mr Libicki .
But what I would like to say is that , whatever one feels about climate change , I think we can all be in favour of the need for energy efficiency .
The growing importance of the sector , in both economic and social terms , warrants an improvement in the information made available .
These are necessary and coherent ways to move forward , which is why we voted in favour .
It seems absolutely essential to me not to appear complacent on this subject and the resolution strongly urges the Iranian government to change course in this matter .
We have yet to achieve this .
For example , it recognises that some fish species are known to have a high survival rate on release and that derogations from a discard ban are possible .
Transfers of appropriations : see Minutes
Unfortunately , over the last decade and a half , instead of generating revenues to the treasury , it has turned into a canker for the whole society .
Desirable developments such as these would be fostered by the system of ethnic rights and tolerance that is now to be put in place in Kosovo .
Thank you .
All the procedural and substantive questions raised in connection with Mr Tomczak &apos;s case , and especially the question of the alleged insulting language used against the police officers , should be resolved objectively by the Polish judicial authorities .
Some of the most important groups are actually those that fall within the comitology procedure .
That is where we need a little bit more in the financial declarations .
I would like to say that Alex Stubb also asked me what I would take out , and I must say that , for instance , I would remove the reference to a spouse &apos;s activity .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the EPP @-@ ED Group is responsible for the report on the fight against fraud for the first time and we are very grateful to Mr Musotto for making OLAF &apos;s work and the cooperation with the Member States the focus of his report .
It will form a reserve , and you can have the money once you have taken appropriate action &apos; .
As the Commissioner said : enlargement , more Member States , new technology , new equipment , computers .
I fully support authorising the Commission as appropriate , so it can provide technical aid and training to liaison officials from third countries and from European and international agencies and organisations .
( CS ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I trust that tomorrow we will approve at second reading the Council &apos;s common position on the customs code .
There is a great deal that unites us .
The report is entitled &apos; The factors favouring support for terrorism and the recruitment of terrorists &apos; .
It is not just about tolerance , it is also about practical measures .
Globalisation is not an external threat from which we need to be protected .
The Commission delegations in certain key countries need a stronger presence .
Indeed , the only rumours that I have picked up about such unwarranted concessions actually came from the Irish Foreign Minister in the General Affairs Council today .
But to argue about whose fault it was , whether it was the fault of the Member States , whether it was the Commission &apos;s fault or which Member States threw a spanner into the works , serves no purpose .
My group has not found the conclusive answer , but we certainly have many more doubts .
I am not playing anyone off against anyone - it is just that , in the real world , people do have different interests , and they have different viewpoints and different needs .
Working with you has also been a lot of fun .
In this respect the main winners will be small businesses , for it is they that experience the greatest difficulty in surmounting these administrative obstacles .
A more effective enforcement of application of the mutual recognition principle will be achieved by establishing a clear procedure , burden of proof , deadlines and responsibilities for both the entrepreneur and the authorities opting for an exception to this principle .
We can only regret our failure to do so , but I do welcome Mr Verheugen &apos;s announcement that the matter is to be the subject of in @-@ depth study , for that is certainly what we need .
That said , the texts before us are an exercise in stating the obvious : they reassert the concept of mutual recognition ; they bow to the mania for labelling - which is termed marking - with the CE logo , its approved dimensions and sanctions for its improper use ; and low and behold , 15 years after the dismantling of borders and customs controls , our rapporteur André Brie demands more resources for customs officers .
I must admit that the subject of European standardisation became close to my heart when I was the European Parliament &apos;s rapporteur for the financing of European standardisation , and I still feel the same way about it now here in the European Parliament .
The internal market involves , besides the free movement of products , taking efficient actions for consumer protection .
For this reason , we must insist - it is our only option - that all those who bear responsibility in the chain are held fully accountable .
( Loud applause )
The report does not involve any change of substance but brings together a number of different directives into a coherent text .
The fact is that the multicultural , compartmentalised societies to which you so earnestly aspire are , by nature , societies prone to multiple conflict .
I bid you a warm welcome to the European Parliament .
In the long term it damages those it was meant to protect .
To date , five Member States out of 27 have ratified the treaty .
So those who attack the EU for being undemocratic are barking mad to oppose a treaty which puts citizens and their representatives in the driving seat .
They are problems and challenges which fall to us because of our successes .
Mr President , I am delighted to welcome the Prime Minister today .
He was absolutely right .
Thank you very much for the patience you have shown with the large amount of Swedish you have had to listen to because of all the questions that have been asked here .
Creativity and innovation are no longer restricted to rigid institutional schemes .
We know that we must continue to strengthen the internal market .
( Applause )
This time we chose deliberately to focus not on energy and climate , because that was the key area in the past two years , and in strategic terms we have in fact achieved what we wanted to achieve with our resolutions , namely to ensure that the Commission and the Council concern themselves deeply with the subject , which is what they are doing .
( NL ) Madam President , we all know that Europe must evolve further into a knowledge @-@ based economy that is better able to compete in world markets .
Nevertheless , I think that one of the lessons for our work with the Commission is that , for our next work on this strategy , we have to focus on these priority actions , because I am pleased to see that the Commission is going to work on these , keep them stable and move them forward .
It was hoped to create 17 000 new jobs in this way .
It calls for a stimulating entrepreneurial climate , which the Lisbon Strategy can help provide if it is implemented very deliberately .
Over the last seven years , the US economy has grown in value by 4.2 billion , while total credits , however , have grown by 21.3 billion .
As far as the Council is concerned , I would also urge the Presidency to take note of paragraph 27 , which urges the Member States to incorporate the basic aspects of transport and logistics into their national plans with appropriate , i.e. heavy , emphasis on the development of trans @-@ European networks .
We will not be able to tell citizens that it is necessary to address the challenges of globalisation , that it is necessary to be more competitive and that the operation of our markets must improve , if our policies do not respond to a greater degree of social inclusion which is also provided for by more competitive and more productive economies .
Throughout Europe management pay has been rising steadily .
Member of the Commission . - ( RO ) I can only repeat what I have just said , namely that , by the actions taken by the European Commission to support language diversity , not only the 23 official languages are supported , but also the other languages spoken in the European Union , including the regional languages , the less widespread languages .
I have ongoing contact with the national regulatory authorities ( NRAs ) and I take note of their views regarding the powers and responsibilities of the proposed authority .
Here we are following the proposal from the Commission and embassies in situ to set up a Water and Energy Academy that can look at the question as a whole , from the point of view also of the environment and sustainability .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( CS ) Ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur for devoting so much time and effort to the preparation of this report .
Unless we build alternative ties with the European Union we are bound to fail , despite the expectations which these countries have of us .
With this strategy for Central Asia and this first broad debate in the European Parliament , we are actively taking the appropriate steps to promote dialogue and to meet all the challenges that still await us and which the Commissioner addressed .
( The sitting was opened at 9.05 p.m. )
Your report , of course , also expresses some concerns on the abandoning of the constitutional approach and on the extension of opt @-@ in arrangements for particular Member States .
Thank you for your attention , and I hope that today , the chairman of the Socialist Group , Martin Schulz , will follow my example .
Would the people of Europe support such a Treaty ?
On the contrary , forging a new relationship between Scotland and the EU is central to our vision .
The same weapons are also used by the NATO Response Force .
It is an improvement in terms of efficiency : we get more qualified majority voting , we get a legal personality , we get a great deal more on external relations and good stuff on justice and home affairs .
( The President cut off the speaker )
One could almost say that it is a didactic aid for students throughout the European Union and beyond .
Mr President , a &apos; yes &apos; for the Lisbon Treaty is a &apos; yes &apos; for the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I would inform everyone who has asked for a consolidated text that the message from the Council is that such a text will be produced , hopefully as soon as possible , and that in the spring we will definitely have a consolidated text from the Council .
Those who demanded these roll @-@ call votes on amendments that contain nothing but questions ought to explain to their voters how much that cost .
We have refused to get our people involved in the process .
in writing . - ( PT ) Well might the majority of the European Parliament - which includes members of the Portuguese socialist ( PS ) , social democrat ( PSD ) and popular right ( CDS / PP ) parties - proclaim their &apos; approval &apos; of the proposed EU Treaty which , as many well know , has no value or legal consequence .
Nor is the European Parliament competent ; it is merely kept up to date ( Article 21 ) .
It is very startling that our Commission is presenting a proposal that includes such intrusive questions and which in practice amounts to registration of citizens .
Whilst pretending not to realise what a profound effect such policies will have on the economic and social situation of the Member States , they continue to propound more of the same , which we roundly reject .
In particular , I would like to point out the dire situation in the area of health , which is attributable to the minimal medical care system .
This method is based on improving cooperation with the Member States before it gets to the stage of instituting official proceedings , except , of course - and this is very important , Mrs Frassoni - in the event that it is obvious from the start that , in all probability , a treaty is being infringed .
National governments are strong entities , with a great deal of power , they are public authorities .
It is the absolute truth .
The European Union has adopted the common position on events in Kosovo and the western Balkans .
The only chink of light was his clear statement that Serbia would not use any form of violence , blackmail or intimidation whatsoever .
I would like to take this opportunity to extend heartfelt thanks to Mr Rupel , Minister of Foreign Affairs , for the way in which he tried to achieve agreement in the Council in this difficult situation .
It is not appropriate then to accuse the democratically elected leaders of Kosovo of high treason instead of commencing neighbourly dialogue with these victims of genocide .
Indeed , a country like Spain is supplying personnel to the mission - this is very EU , very Brussels .
But Russia is not the most important player this time , as it does not have real power to angle events in a way which would not be acceptable for the West .
Will there be a solution that provides reassurance for these minorities , or for ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina ?
It is crucial for the minority communities living in the Member States that legal regulation of the protection of minorities in the Union be established .
European troops under a new mandate could help supervise the reopening of the borders and , as I now ask for your support , European countries can achieve agreement on all sides in the UN Human Rights Council to seek enforcement of international humanitarian law .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - Thank you for this additional question .
Subject : Burma
The next item is the report by Mrs Castex , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the demographic future of Europe .
For decades , we have been learning that climate change and pollution of the environment threaten our future .
That is why we need to replace the Lisbon Strategy with a European strategy for solidarity and sustainable development that opens new horizons for Europe , of decent jobs with rights , in particular for women and young people , reduced working hours with no reduction in pay , better salaries , an end to discrimination , particularly wage discrimination against women , greater economic and social cohesion , adequate protection , and public and universal social security , guaranteeing a better quality of life and greater social justice .
By 2025 , one in three people living in Western Europe may , or will , be Muslim .
This report also stresses that access to adequate services for those who need care plays an important role in ensuring the full and equal participation of men and women in the labour force .
I appreciate the measures proposed in the report in relation to this problem as well .
Maybe it is on too late at night because one could get nightmares based on the demographic trends that are contained in it .
Only societies for whom children are a policy priority and who promote a pro @-@ family environment will be in a position to contend with unfavourable demographic changes .
Are you doing anything to make the laws on intellectual property and patents more flexible ?
This is a truly remarkable document , much better than the previous versions , and it constitutes a firm basis for all manner of reflections on the future of cohesion within Europe .
But territorial cohesion as a concept is the least researched and the least understood .
No @-@ one knows the national and regional situation better than the individual Member States .
So these subsidies - for that is what they are - will be taken from those countries still receiving them and from an ever smaller pot as the chill economic winds from the USA reach us .
We should stick to the tried and tested objectives of structural policy , and we should supplement them with these new components .
Once again , the European Parliament is confirming its very clear position on the importance and role of the cohesion policy , which brings Europe closer to its citizens .
She realises expectations are running high with regard to territorial cohesion , and what this represents once it is taken up in the Lisbon Treaty .
I wish to remove the word &apos; fragmentation &apos; in the first sentence , and then in the second sentence replace the word &apos; assurer &apos; ( ensure ) with &apos; renforcer &apos; ( reinforce ) .
For example , all those involved in placing a product on the market would bear the same responsibility , from the manufacturer to the distributor and importer , but it is not properly indicated how this would work .
In addressing the needs of those who are suffering , we must include the people of southern Israel on whom some days an average of a rocket an hour has been fired and where 75 % of children are reported to be suffering from anxiety and post @-@ traumatic stress .
Disadvantaged regions in particular are less developed and on top of that they are also the ones most affected by demographic changes , namely by population ageing and migration .
1 . East Timor
( PL ) Mr President , East Timor is widely considered to be the most successful example of a transformation process in the history of the United Nations .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would remind you that the high cost of Schengen visas is another mayor problem for the people of Belarus .
Someone needs to lead the way , and I would be inclined to rely on those elites .
author . - ( DE ) Mr President , anyone who has ever seen the Great Lakes region of East Africa from the air might think that it was paradise .
While freedom of expression is laid down in the Commission &apos;s non @-@ paper , the internet is sadly not particularly included or singled out .
It can be this one , but it could also be either of the two others that have been requested .
But this is not just over the recent past ; this is something that has taken place over many decades .
I would like you , Madam President , to draw the European Commission &apos;s attention to the flagrant contradiction between Parliament &apos;s expectations and the Commission &apos;s action in this matter .
Because of this I ask both the European Commission and all Member States to support Belsat financially .
No Member State will be entitled or allowed to violate or to derogate from European legislation on this .
Until now , the Commission and the Council have dealt with the United States administration pragmatically , on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis , each time at the request of the Americans , without ever having the courage to demand real reciprocity from the Americans .
A temptation which may be politically comprehensible to the citizens of those countries involved , but which is not institutionally acceptable .
You do a search , you buy something .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Mr President , as both the rapporteur and Commissioner Barrot have said , following long negotiations in the conciliation process , Parliament and the Council have finally reached an agreement , which I believe to be positive and worthy of our support .
Since time is short , I shall confine myself to a few points .
My main objective was to make this own initiative report as succinct as possible , no longer than twenty or so paragraphs , so that the European Parliament can put its recommendations to the Commission and the Council as effectively as possible .
I look forward to it .
( PL ) Madam President , Mr Albertini has done a good job .
How are we travelling ?
The private sector having been excluded in the initial phase , the GSA &apos;s role is unclear , as is that of the Commission and the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , I am pleased to know that Britain should receive money to help us with the cost of last year &apos;s floods .
EC / Guinea @-@ Bissau Fisheries Partnership Agreement ( debate )
Statement by the President
Of course , we need to concentrate to some extent on the weaknesses but , having heard Mr Nassauer , I would perhaps call them differences in points of emphasis rather than weaknesses , if I may put it that way .
It is also a year of hope for deeper unity in Europe because of the new elections to the European Parliament .
I appeal to the Commission to be reasonable .
Finally , concerning the financing : you will be having this discussion separately , because this is part of the problem - we already have a financial framework until 2013 , and we are all facing the limits of the financial frameworks .
Now is the time for speedy and effective implementation of the agreed measures .
It is by believing in roses that you make them bloom , as Anatole France reminded us .
Now we have produced something so dynamic that it has progressed to the voting stage , and I hope that a large majority will vote in favour of the project .
( Applause )
Here Parliament has shown that it can play a larger role than was ever imagined .
Strasbourg did not like losing this institution .
I am pleased that the European Parliament succeeded in convincing the Council and the Commission to use the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for a whole series of measures when defining the common basic standards for aviation security , such as the screening of passengers , and articles that may be prohibited , such as liquids .
Finally , the fact that climate change as the focus of the first KICs has been explicitly removed from the proposal means that I no longer wish to support the report .
in writing . - ( PT ) The main objective of the new partnership agreement between the EC and Côte d &apos;Ivoire is to strengthen cooperation between the two parties so as to create a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and the sound exploitation of living marine resources in Côte d &apos;Ivoire , special attention being given to supporting the fisheries policy of that state .
I would like to add here that the Council supports Parliament in the suggestion that the Commission prepare a general , long @-@ term strategy , that is to say a proposal for a strategy , for the European dairy sector .
My group wants to see the liberalisation of milk production in Europe by means of market economy and free competition , and the quota system is at odds with this .
I would like to point out the fact that an increase of the quotas by 2 % represents -in fact- an actual increase in milk production at community level by only 0.8 % .
I think that , if we want to introduce an increase as from 1 April , we need to do so with a fixed percentage in all Member States .
We are at the stage in the first round where we have consulted many stakeholders and different organisations and individuals to have their opinions and to collect different ideas .
If not , we would still have the opportunity as Parliament to save ourselves in 2009 .
By dint of quotas , MGQs , Herod premiums , set @-@ aside , decoupling and grubbing up , MacSharry , Steichen , Fischler had practised this strategy of leaving the monopoly on food production to the southern hemisphere and the Pacific countries for 30 years .
Any agreement in the WTO should deal with the issue of protected geographical indications , animal wellbeing and the state of health of imported products , for reasons of fair competition and because health problems do not stop at borders .
The rush to biofuels is taking so much land out of agricultural production that some experts are now predicting imminent global famine .
Here in plenary , we will be having a debate tomorrow to prepare for this European Council , so why , when it comes to financial markets , can we not prepare these questions with the European Parliament too ?
This work has taken on increased importance in the light of the recent turmoil and maybe there will be other aspects of Basle II that we will need to address in the time ahead .
Secondly , I am not so much in agreement with some speeches that may have suggested that the structures for supervision and for reacting to events in the financial system in the United States are superior to those that we have in Europe .
I would like to know your opinion on this .
Member of the Commission . - I said that this is a common cause , a common endeavour , and there are many good ideas and ongoing initiatives at European and national level , plus many at regional and municipal level .
The Lisbon Council achieved something important in spring last year : cultural sectors or the so @-@ called cultural industry have for the first time been mentioned in the Lisbon Strategy , which is credited with making an important contribution to economic growth and employment .
I cannot account for the press ; the days when I could account for what was written in the press have long since passed behind me .
In the cities we have just about everything .
Due to economic policies , rural regions are more prone to changes today .
The increasing use of renewable energies is an integral part of this .
Plant growers tell me that yields for biogas plants can be doubled on good acreage with traditional plant cultivation .
The level of biogas production in EU states , however , varies very widely .
Initially , as Commissioner Fischer Boel has mentioned , this will require government support from the rural development fund .
Can the Commissioner confirm that this regulation will result in more timely availability of vital energy statistics and that the statistical model we use here in the EU is comparable to that used by , for example , the USA and other global players , so that we can compare like with like ?
To be frank , Mr Nassauer , I would venture to doubt that , since these data are available in any case , and there is actually no need for any additional calculations in this regard .
Only then will it be possible to consider the statistics that are still needed .
There are special social categories that are very much affected .
We must , however , set an example and our partners must do the same .
You cannot have protection of the environment without proper investment in new resources , information technology and research and development to create the innovative ways of dealing with the problems we are now facing .
Growth forecasts are increasingly revised downwards .
That is international capitalism for you , creating wealth or destroying value at the whim of the markets , speculative bubbles , financial derivatives and crazed traders who , by the way , are merely doing what they are asked to do , i.e. obtain the maximum profit in the minimum time .
Therefore , I would be grateful if the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council and the President of the Commission would indicate what this year &apos;s Spring Council intends to do to improve performance on energy efficiency .
Let us not forget that the world is moving faster and we need to be more competitive ; we need to be more entrepreneurial .
Mr President , the next European Summit takes place in momentous times .
Europe &apos;s potential rate of increase remains very low .
This would lead to enlargement of the high @-@ quality education and research base of the European Union .
What we must do , on the contrary , is hold our course for the European economic reforms , but these must be economic reforms for an open Europe , a more socially inclusive Europe , a Europe that is more resolute as regards the environment .
The Archbishop of Montenegro regrets that the United States has acted like the Old Testament Ahab , Great Britain forgot its struggle for the Falklands , now it dares to threaten the fate of a Christian country , while Germany does not seem to bear in mind 1914 , 1941 and Kragujevac any more .
The conditions and principles of trade on the global market therefore have important consequences for European agriculture .
This is a sine qua non for enabling the EU to fulfil its stated aim : phasing in a consistent European energy policy and speaking with a single voice on the international scene .
For me , the 2 % increase is also a step in giving milk producers the option to produce more and thereby helping the transition to greater market orientation .
The proposals on a basic safety net and a crisis management system are welcome .
On the other hand , there is insufficient support for economic initiatives and female entrepreneurship .
With the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty 15 years ago , the European Parliament was finally granted full codecision powers in initial areas of Community policy , enabling it to make a real contribution to the framing of legislation , and apply the brakes , if necessary , against the will of the Council .
With this thought Jean Monnet takes us one step closer to explaining why the vision of the European Union is still often different from reality and why many Europeans , despite the very evident successes of the last 50 years , still doubt the benefits of European integration .
Parliament is delighted to observe the Commission &apos;s growing concern about perfecting the use of European funds in Iraq in an extremely difficult context .
We also encourage European firms and companies to renew their commitment to Iraq .
I spent a large part of 2006 working in the Council representation in Baghdad helping them .
I think there is an understanding that things could become better .
in writing . - Several Member States of the EU have sent their troops to Iraq to participate in the multinational force , United Nations assistance mission and NATO @-@ sponsored training of the Iraqi police force , Estonia being one of those countries .
Is it not time that we invested in conflict resolution for troubled states instead of arms sales ?
Hundreds of thousands of civilians are forced to live in extremely vulnerable conditions in eastern Chad , impatiently awaiting EUFOR deployment .

I did not get the impression there was any kind of alliance of interests between the French President , in other words , France &apos;s most senior representative , and President Déby .
Does the Presidency agree that this is not , in fact , a presidency of the Union , it is a chairmanship of one of the institutions , each institution having its own president ?
Do the authorities and the governments of Canada and the United States not understand that we have a solution in the European Union ?
We are rightly concerned about ensuring a good quality of life as well as the financial sustainability of health and social care for the elderly .
Our very good wishes go with it .
The elderly , especially in the new Member States , are not at all or partially familiar with this field and the losses resulting for society as a whole are plain to see .
Moreover , there is no reason to have separate taxes on unleaded petrol and diesel .
In view of the record inflation , a cause of great concern to the European Central Bank , and the economic downturn we are currently witnessing , it seems to me that this is a particularly bad time to increase the excise duty rate on gas oil and fuel oil .
The financial analysts who look in detail at flows of investment into individual renewable energy and energy efficiency projects have observed that it is difficult to attract risk capital for investments of less than EUR 10 million . This Fund will be geared particularly to these medium @-@ sized projects up to EUR 10 million .
It is grass @-@ root development which generally does the most to improve the lives of the poorest people .
We , like the United Nations , are committed to carrying out more projects there and not concentrating only on projects in China and India .
We are aware that in order to tackle the challenges faced by imprisoned women , the Member States and the Commission must focus on living conditions in prisons , the essential maintenance of family ties and social relations and , of course , the importance of social and professional reintegration .
The exact numbers differ from country to country , as do prison conditions .
In many European prisons , a difference can be observed between the vocational training offered to women and the demands of the labour market .
We must coordinate our cooperation and learn from each other .
I think that awareness @-@ raising has a very important role to play in that respect .
Much has been achieved , yet there is still no evidence of equal opportunities in the poorest countries of this world .
Women must be granted equal opportunities , fair pay , equality on the employment ladder , equal access to education at all levels , access to health care and equality in family affairs .
No one would think of refusing a man the right to decide on his own reproduction or say that it was a question of cultural values to refuse a man the possibility of earning his own money and maintaining his own independence .
They are about scrapping all references to even the most moderate UN texts on women &apos;s rights .
Following the recent elections there are one @-@ third fewer women in Silesian politics .
One day the European Union will have cause to regret its stance .
The approximation will continue in 2012 and 2015 .
Initiatives and measures seeking at the very least to mitigate such an escalation are therefore positive and necessary .
The improvement of the position of women and the living conditions of the peoples of these countries will be achieved not through the legalised robbery of &apos; EU developmental aid &apos; , but through resistance to imperialist intervention , the quest for equal international relations and the struggle for a different developmental approach based on the needs of the people .
There are other quite similar events in another country in that area and they represent a continuation of the situation in place after 1990 .
The reason why my group did not do so is not to avoid having a discussion today .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to add one more thing to the list of abuses in this election , which made it not really an election at all since there was nobody to choose between .
Otherwise we should seriously consider pulling both our troops and our money out of Afghanistan and letting that country follow the hellish course that it will be sentenced to by its fanatic religious destiny .
With regard to the protection of refugees , we would point out that international law stipulates , notably in the Geneva Convention in relation to the status of refugees , that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership of a particular social group or political opinion .
As confirmed by our social partners at the tripartite summit held at the fringes of the European Council session , climate change brings opportunities for all , that is to say both companies and employees .
I would like to give you a flavour of three areas on which we will be working to come forward with proposals before the summer .
( Applause )
I support calls for the transition to a low @-@ carbon economy to be made in a way that is consistent with the EU &apos;s sustainable development , competitiveness , security of supply , and sound and sustainable public finance , especially when coupled with a recognition of the risks of carbon leakage or the offshoring of European jobs and linked with the call for flexibility in achieving national renewable targets .
That is why I have now taken to emphasising one particular point : the European Union &apos;s credibility with the citizens hinges on whether we actually put into practice what we adopt on paper .
You make no connection with public investment and raising the level of private investment , and you seem to lack any connection with the workers and their demands , workers who - at least in most European countries , the core countries that have been the bedrock of economic growth - are suffering from the lack of any margin of distribution .
A working visit by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in China from 16 to 21 March in which I participated confirmed my belief that it is high time for Europe to kick @-@ start its knowledge @-@ based economy , and to encourage the creativity and innovative abilities of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises for the future development of the European economy .
But what we want - and what we will do already - is to give legal certainty .
In large Romanian towns kindergartens cover less than 70 % of parents &apos; demand .
They did not discuss participation in the opening ceremony .
Olympic Games in a dictatorship are a political act , whether we like it or not , whether the law likes it or not .
All European governments should act in unison and boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games .
This summer the Olympic Games will be held in China .
The Chinese had the wisdom to find a solution in the case of Hong Kong and Macao based on the principle of &apos; one country , two systems &apos; .
A minority fighting for its rights , calling for the autonomy it has been promised , but which has been taken from it .
As you are aware , Europe is active at many different levels to help Lebanon : we remain the biggest contributor to UNIFIL , and the European Union has also been the most important donor at the Paris III Conference .
Hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating in the streets , waving &apos; We Want The Truth &apos; banners .
Therefore , it is simply not the case that we are ready to conclude the treaties and negotiations - absolutely not .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation with the Commission services on the report .
I therefore , think that all parties have learnt a useful lesson especially the FYROM .
On the name issue , the report does not criticise either of the two sides . It only encourages both sides to carry on negotiations , despite what happened at the NATO Summit in Bucharest last week .
( PL ) Madam President , I asked to be allowed to speak on the subject of Croatia and Macedonia in order to emphasise the complexity of the situation in the Balkans and the need to conduct a calm and balanced policy .
There is now a new understanding of its importance , both because of the concrete benefits on the ground - economic benefits , communications , transport , people @-@ to @-@ people contacts - and because regional cooperation moves the countries closer to the European Union .
in writing . - According to Eurostat data , Croatian GDP per capita stands at 53 per cent of the EU average .
If the Canadian authorities are so very confident that these regulations are being adhered to , then why are they doing their utmost to prevent animal welfare specialists and journalists from witnessing it ?
Hundreds of young people die every day for the simple reason that they don &apos;t have access to this register .
You probably know , from the emphasis in the report and in the question , that cancer cases in Europe are on the increase .
I see that we have a Commissioner who knows how things are with cancer , and who will , together with us , put up a fight .
But , as far as I am concerned , I will exert all my influence in encouraging Member States to do so .
If legislation on industry does not accord with policies on agriculture and rural development , then our water resources will continue to be polluted .
For instance , the objective of stopping the loss of biodiversity by 2010 cannot be achieved , and the strategies proposed for protecting the marine environment and the soil will give no concrete results by 2012 .
That capacity for initiative and adaptability makes it easier to launch new business ventures involving the manufacture and / or sale of new products or the operation of new services tailored to the needs of consumers or other businesses .
On 10 July 2007 , the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council decision on the revision of these technical guidelines .
I believe that it is better that this money is used for research and development rather than for anything else , because it is true that in energy and climate change there is no room for complacency .
Combating piracy is particularly important in this regard .
( PL ) Madam President , the draft resolution draws attention to the link between a flourishing cultural industry and the cross @-@ frontier mobility of artists ; it urges the Commission to issue a Green Paper on the internal market for creators of products and services , which will provide an opportunity to compare achievements in this sphere .
This means that we must enable the creators to distribute their work as widely as possible , without any fear of abuse from the middlemen or the consumers .
This really is a new quality .
First I should like to stress the new policy to introduce culture in the terms set out in the Commission &apos;s communication .
The next review of the common fisheries policy is due by 2012 and this report is a wake @-@ up call that historic fishing rights are under threat in the North and Baltic Seas .
I would like to say to Mrs Attwooll that fishing is indeed an economic activity , and one that needs to be profitable , which is now ceasing to be the case , therefore perhaps we need more economists in fisheries than there are at present , to analyse these issues in more detail .
Even though the Lisbon Treaty has not yet been ratified in all countries , we have to take account , in our budgeting , of its entry into force in 2009 .
I wish to tell him that we are only at the consultation stage with this dossier , and I should like to assure him on behalf of the whole Parliament that our amendments will help to bring greater order into the agency system .
I am thinking of large @-@ scale regional bodies such as the Alpine Convention and the Carpathian Convention , which are developing some very worthwhile initiatives and can be used as a model for international cooperation .
In our amendments , we have concentrated to a very great extent on soil protection .
It is a matter that affects the whole world today and every one of us .
( Applause )
In terms of the Irish situation we have actually reduced our emissions from agriculture by 3 % since 1990 , but look at what has happened to transport , where emissions are up by 163 % .
Would it not be better to coordinate our position everywhere , in the knowledge that the climate change policy is a policy on the redistribution of resources ?
3 . Amendment of regulation on a standard financial regulation for executive agencies ( Rule 131 ) ( vote )
5 . Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action ( vote )
This is the case with English , Spanish and Portuguese and , to a lesser extent , French .
Different management tools should be studied with a view to ensuring the long @-@ term viability of Europe &apos;s fishing communities , but the key decisions relating to these tools should be the responsibility of the fishing nations , not the European institutions .
in writing . - ( PL ) I voted in favour of adoption of the report by Mr Gierek on the Research Fund for Coal and Steel .
in writing . - ( PL ) I was part of the delegation from the Committee on Foreign Affairs that visited Zagreb at the beginning of this year .
in writing . - ( PL ) The contribution that culture makes to economic growth and its impact on employment was confirmed as a result of research published by the European Commission at the end of 2006 .
in writing . - ( PT ) I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the Commission Green Paper on &apos; Adapting to climate change in Europe - options for EU action &apos; as I share the belief that adaptation measures constitute a guarantee against the negative and unavoidable effects of climate change .
Therefore , we contribute fully to illegal deforestations in the Amazon and what &apos;s more , the phenomenon is also widespread in EU Member States such as Estonia , Romania and Bulgaria .
I believe more can be done , more could have been done and more should be done to ensure we provide a very strong base to this peace process that many of us have worked so hard to achieve over such a long period of time .
In conclusion , I would like to express my thanks to you , Mr President , and to Commissioner Mr Ján Figeľ , for launching and sponsoring the exhibition , whose motto is &apos; Uniting people through the passion for a sport &apos; , and of course to all those who visited this exhibition and will pass the message on to others .
We are now in a situation where the rising price of food really may have an impact on the EU &apos;s budget .
I want to say something important while this budget is still being drafted .
The next item is the Commission statement on crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by totalitarian regimes .
Justice will prevail only if those responsible can be taken to court .
Real European integration of former communist countries requires not just truth and restitution but also the condemnation of dictatorship .
Some European countries still have legal communist parties .
Finally , ladies and gentlemen , bilateral cross @-@ border cooperation has always existed but this decision will be a first in terms of Europe @-@ wide cooperation .
All of us are particularly concerned about the need to strike a balance between combating terrorism and crime and , at the same time , rigorously protecting private and public rights because no one may be stripped of his civil rights for the sake of the fight against terrorism .
At the moment Belarusians must pay EUR 60 for a visa .
I have explained why , so far , there have been no plans to enter into negotiations on an agreement on visa facilitation .
Four , we think it is very important to consider living donors as well as post @-@ mortem donors .
Allow me to take this opportunity to raise an important but highly controversial issue , which , although not the subject of decision presently , nevertheless needs to be addressed at some stage : this is the concept of presumed consent .
Naturally everyone must make their own decision , and no one can overrule them or force them .
What is required is a Commission directive that adds value and sets common EU @-@ wide quality and safety standards which complement existing arrangements in Member States .
This assessment will serve as a source of better knowledge and a solid basis for further initiatives in this field , as no systematic and integrated approach towards volunteering has been developed so far at EU level .
Member States and regional authorities ought to try to ensure that voluntary groups and projects can transparently and flexibly have access to adequate , sustainable funding from the Structural Funds .
This has to be changed .
I think that our debate about the changes started at the initiative of the current Ombudsman contained two misunderstandings , which we managed , I believe , to resolve in committee .
Moreover , EMSA has recently concluded contracts with other oil recovery vessels in order to provide Europe &apos;s coasts with even better protection , and , in the very near future , two new vessels , the Bahia Uno and the Bahia Tres , will be operating out of Algeciras Bay .
Algeciras Bay has become the dumping ground of the Straits of Gibraltar .
It is a Community instrument , but within it power is exercised intergovernmentally .
Finally , to Mr Dillen who , if I understood correctly , mentioned a project he said we financed in the Democratic Republic of Congo , I can say that for several years now we have not provided any more finance in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
The Commission has now committed itself to granting public access to the final beneficiary , i.e. the final recipient of the support , from 2007 onwards , which is something that I acknowledge and believe is entirely necessary .
However , I would like to give the Commission credit for having taken these problems seriously and presented concrete , correct and important solutions to these challenges .
Agencies are European administrative units , although they have a unique nature .
Naturally , all new members receive support .
I feel it will be unmarketable to the voters if we grant ourselves discharge .
Mr President , I have some questions .
One of the reasons is that a considerable proportion of the funds is administered under shared management , i.e. 80 % of the EU &apos;s funds are managed by the Member States .
- Before the vote on Amendment 4 :
They enable an offender to be identified regardless of where the crime was committed .
The best way to have dealt with the report would have been to put it in the public domain , because then people would have realised that it is not millions of pounds that are at issue , but a very small amount of money - still worth chasing and policing , and giving the Members that abuse the system a great deal of hassle and taking them to the courts over , but not as bad as the general public now think this whole place is .
in writing . - ( SV ) We support the report , as international cooperation to use important organs for transplantation is a good thing .
This recognition of the usefulness of volunteering in both the public and private sphere is essential to its development and to finding the balance between economic , social and the environmental aspects ; i.e. the sustainable development that is at the heart of the European approach .
Similar projects with no social control are also promoted in third countries to secure greater profits for businesses in the name of growth - the growth of capital , naturally .
In terms of the area of Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) , I support the call for maximum transparency and to make sure that , in accordance with point 42 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 , no operating CFSP expenditure should appear in the Council &apos;s budget .
I support the request for the Commission to present a study every five years on the added value of each agency and not to hesitate to close an agency if the analysis concludes that it is not useful .
Looking at the possible solutions , we have identified two key options .
We should stop advocating simplistic and purely economic solutions which do not provide long @-@ term solutions to the current crisis .
I have received over a hundred requests to vote against the Commission &apos;s renewable energy target .
Let us examine the external causes , population density , natural disasters , the loss of human life through HIV and AIDS and , more importantly , the links between poor governance and the humanitarian consequences .
In addition to population growth we shall see an increase in the demand for food , something we are short of even now - and not just in third countries , but in European countries too .
We should be cultivating food in these areas .
But this is not enough !
Let us not forget , however , that little more than a year ago the price of a barrel of oil was USD 70 , the profitability of agricultural production was different , and so was the profitability of biofuels , whereas today a barrel of oil costs USD 115 .
The second priority , in the medium term , is to give massive support to developing countries that are not self @-@ sufficient so that they can produce more .
However , for these applications to become a reality , clearly Galileo must materialise .
However , I hope that our programme will prove just as successful .
Until only recently , the project was practically buried because of the difficulties with funding .
I would now like to tell you a bit about the work that awaits us .
With regard to the second , very general question , I agree with you that it is annoying that we do not have to guarantee the possibility in the existing EU Treaty that tax avoidance and tax evasion will be pursued in the same way everywhere in Europe and that it still cannot be guaranteed that nobody will aid and abet tax evasion or tax avoidance .
The threshold for early retirement used to be at 50 years in Greece ; it has been raised for future generations to the age of 55 , but not of this case of mothers with children .
I am also aware that the low cod quota allocation is at the root of this association , since the share of the UK &apos;s cod quota for this part of the fleet is only about 3 % of the total , despite the fact that the relative catch potential of this part of the fleet may be considerably larger .
As a result of the extra measures taken , both countries are now withdrawing the unilateral measures they have taken in the past .
This Committee could be the appropriate forum to discuss a wide range of issues stemming from the implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive .
I should add that , in all three cases , the famous Posting of Workers Directive has not offered the slightest protection to the workers concerned .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , I disagree with you in that there would be no discrepancy between strong social protection of employees and a strong internal market .
This is therefore a massive problem , not for those countries , but for the whole of Europe , which is seeing how its national laws are being undermined , and how Europe is not only failing to guarantee better protection for its workers but is breaking the systems of national protection .
We need to spend more time discussing the Social Agenda .
If it works then so much the better , but I doubt it .
Finally , I applaud the report &apos;s appeal for multilateral dialogue between the EU , Africa and China . This is particularly important in relation to climate change .
( FR ) Commissioner , after everything that you have said , let us examine China &apos;s presence in Africa .
That is why this report is so timely .
In my opinion , Europe will always remain a special partner of Africa for historical reasons , for geographical reasons , for model reasons .
I believe that the EU has a major weapon here for tackling poverty and building a fairer world .
I would therefore like to encourage the ACP countries to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement as soon as possible .
We are equally pleased , Mr President , that you have expressed your interest in participating in the May EU @-@ LAC Summit .
We must make intelligent use of the Community funding instruments relating to development cooperation , promotion of democracy and human rights and other programmes in relation to training , education , scientific and technical cooperation , health , emigration , etc .
Lastly , to prevent us from falling into some rather typically European romantic temptations with respect to terrorism or organisations which , like the FARC , are now drug @-@ dealing guerrillas , not the romantic paramilitary groups of the 70s , they could also be called upon to abandon violence once and for all , unilaterally and unconditionally .
We hope that the Lima Summit will achieve a further step towards the acceptance and implementation of commitments undertaken .
The American negotiators have also endorsed the joint objective of secure travel between the European Union and the United States , without a visa , as soon as possible .
( PT ) Mr President , Minister Mate , Vice @-@ President Barrot , ladies and gentlemen , on 10 March I expressed in this House my fears on this issue .
It will allow the US to access the EU &apos;s databases containing travellers &apos; personal details , taxation data and even criminal records .
We have concluded the agreements , we have found a way of resolving this , we have achieved a twin @-@ track cooperation approach for the future and therefore , in a way , we have made it clear , both to the United States of America and to the EU Member States , how we can cooperate and where the limits are of what is and what is not acceptable .
The oral amendment proposed by Mr Landsbergis is not in line with this decision .
They are interested in international activities , but at the same time they have to take into account their regional and other affiliations , and also that in all international activities connected with human rights these aspects are not neglected .
Mr President , as I listened to the debate yesterday I thought of the Queen song Bohemian Rhapsody and those immortal words &apos; Galileo , Galileo &apos; .
I was positive about the project being financed from the EU &apos;s budget from the start .
They constitute a serious problem but bureaucratic efforts have not curtailed the activities of dealers who sell drugs at schools , centres of higher education , housing estates and other public places , and it is unlikely that they will do so in the future .
Since some of the amendments can change the meaning of the report , our vote on the final &apos; product &apos; will depend on whether or not the amendments are adopted .
I must stress our disappointment that his visit did not have any obvious results .
Of course , ladies and gentlemen , on a sentimental level I agree with everything stated in the resolution , but given that - as usual - everything emanating from EU acts remains at the level of sentiment I think it is utterly useless .
I am in no doubt that the Council will call for the immediate release of all political detainees , as pointed out by Mr Howitt .
Frontex has a larger overall budget , the CRATE database is fully operational and the rapid intervention teams are in place .
The extension of Schengen to the east is for the moment the latest of these damaging decisions .
Thirdly , a holistic rather than fragmented policy must be implemented .
Mr Fava , in particular , wanted to know if the equipment used by Frontex was fully operational .
They can be summarised in seven points .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Commissioner , two weeks ago I represented the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and the Temporary Committee on Climate Change at the informal Environment Council in Slovenia .
But I do not want to give only bad examples .
We in the Commission consider the long @-@ term benefits of biofuels in terms of less CO2 emissions because , remember , the alternative today is oil .
This subject concerns us all , for it does not relate solely to each individual state .
&apos;The goal of Olympianism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of man , and &#91; ... &#93; any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race , religion , politics , gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic movement &apos; - two fundamental principles of the Olympic Charter to which the Chinese have signed up .
The commander confirmed that EUFOR would carry out its mandate in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolution , that is to say with impartiality and consistent respect for the Sudanese borders .
Every day we can see that it is beset by problems concerning its efficiency , legitimacy and interaction with the other bodies of the multilateral system .
Much work is needed to ensure the consistency of international policies .
Above all else , clarity and competitiveness involve ensuring that the production process meets established standards and quality requirements regarding for instance environmental protection , work and pay conditions , and animal welfare .
The European Union feels that the GCC members lack coordination and reform and the latter complain of an interminable list of requirements that the Gulf States must meet .
Therefore , it is a priority to set a well @-@ defined schedule for completing the current negotiations , as well as to formulate the major purpose of mutual benefits , which would lead not only to strengthening the economic relations between the EU and the Gulf States , as well as consolidating stability and sustained development in general .
( The President cut off the speaker )
I therefore wish to emphasise that we are facing a serious problem of animal feed shortages , and the European Commission is responsible for dealing with this situation .
The proposal to adopt zero tolerance is spurious and ineffective ; it is the result of compromising with the interests of multinationals .
The twentieth century showed us that utopias are bound to fail without proper economic and social frameworks .
( PL ) Mr President , the threat to the world &apos;s environmental balance requires us to take steps that will result in changes to our models of growth and a new lifestyle in our societies .
Bulgaria , for example , will be facing problems in the future .
The debate is closed .
So I think it is important that we should seriously consider how to develop European alternatives to the proposals from London , with the aim of achieving greater standardisation in this area too - but standardisation that is sensible and appropriate for SMEs and geared to the long term , rather than short @-@ term valuation .
The IASB was asked to draw up a simplified version for SMEs .
Hopefully , I think the new governance structures have been appreciated by most of us .
Madam President , I fully support the adopted resolution drafted by Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra and others .
All of this could have been stated on two pages far more effectively than the four pages of rambling text we are now faced with .
We also consider that the proposal conflicts with personal privacy and freedom , especially as no justification is given as to why this data is to be collected or what it will be used for .
Yet , during this time , over all those years , other African leaders have stood by and either done nothing or else they have applauded the tyrant whenever they had the opportunity .
That is why I welcome the first positive steps on the part of the African National Congress - although it needs to do more !
It is humiliating to learn that even today women can be punished by lashing or even with the death penalty .
Let us hope that this motion for a resolution will send a clear message to Mr Deby , as well to all other parties involved in that troublesome part of the world , that the time has come for national reconciliation , the strengthening of democratic processes and respect for human rights .
( ES ) Mr President , as regards the vote on Zimbabwe , I am here for the vote but will not participate .
The institutions and instruments that govern this Union are appropriate , especially if we take into account the improvements introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon .
The inflation rate in the last 10 years was lower than in the previous 10 years , even in very stability @-@ conscious countries like Germany .
Personally I would really like to see a new Swedish referendum in the autumn of 2010 or the spring of 2011 .
In Greece , New Democracy , PASOK and the Left @-@ Wing Coalition have voted in favour of the Maastricht Treaty .
In this context , I would like to welcome the electoral assistance programme , funded by the European Commission , in which four NGOs , the United Nations and the Council of Europe are participating .
The situation between Georgia and Russia is indeed increasingly tense .
Firstly , there will be no tolerance of provocative acts by Russia .
The EU should demonstrate its full support for Georgia , systematically increase cooperation and facilitate visa arrangements for Georgians without delay .
We must diagnose , foresee and prevent crises , and economic freedom must not mean economic anarchy .
I think that the Transatlantic Economic Council would be the appropriate platform for doing this and , therefore , I would like to hear whether Commissioner Verheugen agrees with me that this issue should be included in the agenda for the TEC .
When you look at it closely , it is incomprehensible , unbelievable , that we have been carrying on like this for so many years .
The Commission has a monopoly on the right of initiative . We respect that .
( ES ) Mr President , thank you , Commissioner .
This is crucial if we are to go beyond simply formally defending human rights documents and texts , and if we are to bring human rights to life in the context of dictatorships and &apos; non @-@ democracies &apos; .
The well @-@ established cooperation between the EU EOMs and the European Parliament combines technical expertise with political sensitivity and ensures that the EU speaks with one voice .
Specific demands are also addressed to the Member States .
However , I regret that the report was not drafted jointly by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development , in view of the fact that the chairmen of these two committees jointly chair the European Parliament &apos;s election observation group .
None .
I support the proposal to convene a European Conference on Non @-@ Violence in 2009 .

Mr President , there is , as you know , a debate going on in Ireland on the Treaty of Lisbon as we have the privilege of voting as an electorate on this Treaty .
With the final of this year &apos;s football championships approaching , there has been enormous pressure over the past few weeks on teams and players who might be able to influence the final outcome of the championship .
Other countries within and outside the continent want something similar , as the Commissioner said .
In this whole process , the involvement and support of civil society are essential .
I would like to underline that in cotton regions in Spain and Greece rural development programmes are actually efficiently used , for example the different agri @-@ environmental schemes .
It seems to me that this has been somewhat confused in the previous speeches .
Bottom @-@ trawlers are operating in a way that would require a major environmental impact assessment in any other industry operating in deep @-@ sea areas .
Framework for the activities of lobbyists in the EU institutions ( debate )
The common and mandatory register and code of conduct , the corresponding sanctions and financial disclosure are key issues which are correctly included in this report .
However , we should not assume from the outset that this now represents a major change compared with the current situation .
Transparency must therefore mean that all amendments to legal texts submitted by lobbyists must be registered openly so that we can see who is behind them .
This is the EU &apos;s first effort to deal with sporting matters .
I sincerely hope that the &apos; Pierre de Coubertin &apos; Action Plan that forms part of the White Paper will be taken seriously by the Member States and that the Commission will provide the necessary guidance and , where appropriate , economic assistance from the development funds at its disposal .
Human lives are lost every year in confrontations between supporters .
As ever , though , the committees came in at this point , and the amendments that were adopted in the Committee on Culture ruined just about any good work that was done .
Of course , it also shows the significance of the text that is to be incorporated into the Reform Treaty .
In great European cities , there are already parking facilities that provide tourists with bicycles , free of charge , during the entire period of stay of the vehicles .
( EL ) Madam President , for a delicate and particularly important product in Greece &apos;s agriculture , one would expect that with a reform yielding , if anything , to the pressure of the European Court of Justice rulings there would be a safeguard for the new CMO in cotton until 2013 .
What is especially good about it in my opinion is that it recognises the specificity of sport and gives attention to special needs groups , including the disabled .
Although I can accept the principle of a transatlantic market , it will be impossible , and even less desirable , to complete it by 2015 .
In other words , our report is an important and very significant list , but it will never be as much as it could and should have been .
We have therefore , in spite of everything , chosen to vote in favour of the report .
in writing . - I welcome the proposed register of lobbyists .
The fact that it did not succeed in going further is in itself testament to how much influence lobbyists have over the EU system .
To that extent I was prepared to support the report .
( DE ) Mr President , for the sake of good order , I wish to announce that we intend to move a postponement of the vote on the Grosch report , which deals with rest periods and the question of bus drivers .
In secular Europe the Member States do not intervene in religious matters and the church does not put ideological pressure on the state .
The Member States will agree on definitions of environmental offences , on the extent of corporate liability for such offences , and on the need to introduce effective , proportionate and deterrent sanctions .
For this reason , I support the introduction of the two annexes to the directive .
What has always been said about the EU budget as a whole - that you cannot do more for less money - has now proved possible .
This has come as a mortal blow to many developing countries which are heavily dependent on food imports and were already living on the margins .
We have no transparency regarding the trade in such materials engaged in by China and certain other countries .
The concept of JTIs was introduced in the Seventh Framework Programme as a new mechanism to implement long @-@ term , public @-@ private partnership in research at European level .
It is important to note that it is earmarked for the tobacco @-@ producing regions .
That cigarette is then in any case of such inferior quality that we do not want to smoke it in Europe and we dump it somewhere else .
Within the process it is important to involve local communities , and Mrs de Brún &apos;s report highlights the wide range of projects including childcare , after @-@ school projects , enterprise parks and small business enterprise , in both the rural and urban areas .
Once again , thank you very much for all your comments .
We consider that some aspects could and should be clarified and reinforced , however .
The vote will take place on Tuesday , 20 May 2008 .
In all other respects I support the report .
The EU should not legislate without strong reasons .
That is further justification for harmonising the rules in the Member States .
The Commission also found that it was necessary to propose changes , with emphasis on certain important tasks that would be tackled in the near fu climate change , energy , social dimension and flexicurity .
The guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs need to be clearly visible to them : competitive jobs , equal opportunities and social cohesion .
However , there are some very decisive elements on which we need to work in a particular way .
I sincerely hope that the submission of this report is not in vain , because , although Article 128 of the Treaty grants this Parliament the right to be consulted , in practice this right is at risk of being undermined .
We cannot allow this .
We need to act rigorously .
How can this be ?
Still only 30 % of the MEPs are women and only 9 MEPs are non @-@ white .
Protection against discrimination on grounds of age , sexual orientation , religious belief or disability is absent today in areas such as social welfare , goods and services , health care and education .
Mr Commissioner , will the Commission be putting forward a proposal on the coast guard in this parliamentary term or not ?
Madam President , my constituency of South @-@ East England includes over half the coastline of the English Channel , a name that that stretch of water has held for centuries .
The debate is closed .
( DE ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this report mainly for two reasons : firstly , because this report quite emphatically demands that the Member States finally implement the Lisbon Strategy and therefore measures on employment policy as well , and secondly , because it demands that good and affordable childcare arrangements finally be set up in the Member States .
Different education systems and regulations on occupational qualifications , however , often make it difficult to accept employment in occupations in which we hold qualifications .
in writing . - ( PL ) Although the vote on the Belato report was positive , it does not resolve the problem of smoking and tobacco production .
We should also develop facilities for MEPs to receive visitors because these visits are very much appreciated and help citizens to get to know more about the European Union .
differential treatment in the transport sector , particularly as regards the inclusion of civil aviation in the Emission Trading Scheme ;
in writing . - ( NL ) Mr President , in principle , the report by Mr Lehtinen has my support .
Similarly , setting up regional centres of excellence and providing encouragement and support for university research centres already in coastal areas , accompanied by an action plan based on innovation , research and environmental protection of oceans and seas , would represent a further step forward towards fully sustainable use of marine resources .
I should remind you that in addition to the Commission , most Member States also rejected the idea of extending the Directive to cover unfair commercial practices that do not harm the consumer .

A rapid agreement is necessary for the following reasons : the European Council of March 2007 expressed its wish in this respect ; the sector in question , more than 900,000 enterprises , wants to harmonise the conditions for access to the profession in order to have a loyal competition and clear rules regarding this restricted but delicate problem , namely cabotage .
We have also been examining cabotage rather more realistically and this means we are already able to start after the first unloading .
We will just have to wait and see .
This is an important package of measures that have a major , very specific impact upon a great many people within Europe .
We must allow people to have a better life and , if we can lower the costs , our economy will improve and the ordinary people will benefit from it .
I would like to invite the Italian Government and the governments of the other Member States to discuss the results of this exercise with us and to take notice of the lessons that can be drawn from it .
We have heard about the integration of communities into host societies , but how can that happen when the sheer numbers of immigrants do not allow it ?
- ( DE ) Madam President , more than 10 million Sinti and Roma live at the margins of society within the European Union .
Only one thing needs to be said , and I will conclude on this point : there are 200 000 Roma in Italy .
It is designed to promote the use of sustainably produced biofuels while discouraging the use of poorly performing ones .
But we have an obligation to communicate and to engage with citizens on the policies and the positions that the institutions take , and I hope we can continue to do it hand in hand .
One such area concerns the free movement of persons , with the goal being to combat discrimination based on nationality in all sports .
First of all , with regard to the judicial and fundamental rights chapter where there appears to be a lot of difficulties concerning the negotiations : how best can we help Croatia to advance on that side of it ?
Once the text has been adopted in Parliament and approved by the Council , I ask the Commission to do everything to quickly establish mobile satellite services according to reasonable pricing that needs to be monitored .
Mr President , thank you for the opportunity to speak .
However , although much has been written about it , discrimination occurs on a daily basis .
It is a mission that makes better use of the high potential of women without falling into the other extreme .
( 11488 / 1 / 2007 - C6 @-@ 0034 / 2008 - ( Rapporteur : Dimitrios Papadimoulis ) .
It is a hazardous chemical which we know will be dispersed in nature by gold washers and which will destroy the environment in other countries .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
We urgently need to establish facilities that will be deemed the best of their kind in terms of human rights , health and safety .
Those responsible in the shipping sector inform us that the new international Convention on ship recycling will combine with market forces to solve the shipbreaking problem .
To achieve this , a radical change is needed in the way we produce and use energy .
Generating power from the desert sun , as a supplement to sources of renewable energy here in Europe , could speed up the process of cutting CO2 emissions at a stroke .
This knowledge is precisely the basis upon which , in the space of one year , Commissioner Dimas , the world political climate has also changed , and global warming is not the only thing to have happened .
We shall be addressing that in the next report . I expect some sound ideas to be presented in that area .
I agree with Martin Schulz that we should call a halt to the debate based on beliefs and consider the facts .
It is important for the EU to take advantage of every opportunity for dialogue with the main developing countries , so that there is agreement on what exactly this means and how the EU can support such actions , either through cooperation in formulating policy , technical assistance , the transfer of know @-@ how and the provision of incentives on the CO2 market , or through financial assistance .
Raising public awareness by communicating scientific evidence of human impact on global climate will play a key role in obtaining the support of the EU citizens for political actions on reducing carbon emissions .
Both government and opposition parties should engage in dialogue and search for compromise on the sensitive issues dominating the domestic debate , including the constitutional reform process .
The alternative package would not cause tensions such as those currently experienced in Ankara and in European capitals regarding the debate about Turkey becoming a full member of the European Union .
One does remain , however , and that is the disagreement on Amendment 14 concerning reproductive health .
If I look at what is happening with Article 301 of the Penal Code , freedom of religion and the Law on Foundations , minority rights and so forth , it is clear that the Erdoğan government is trying to make progress , but it has always stopped short of what is required because quite obviously , at a domestic level , the limits of Turkey &apos;s reform capacity have been reached .
We can all send a positive signal by voting for the report by a large majority .
In the Council , not even the Spanish Government insisted on these amendments .
However , I would like to add - and I say this in all seriousness , not as a criticism but as an example of how the law of the European Union works - that if someone starts to question applicable law , we will end up in chaos .
Consequently , containing rainwater in a region and draining away only the natural surplus water is a prerequisite for ensuring environmental security and global stability and , last but not least , for maintaining economic growth .
in writing . - I am generally in favour of what is proposed for the 2009 calendar of part @-@ sessions .
We therefore feel it is positive that the report recognises the significant methodological and technical difficulties in many Member States and also that it insists on the need for the Commission to provide farmers with the necessary technical and advisory assistance in respect of the satellite recognition of agricultural holdings .
in writing . - ( PL ) The Commission communication on a simplified business environment for companies in the areas of company law , accounting and auditing sets out measures aimed at reducing the administrative burden on European companies and ensuring that they can compete effectively at global level .
In fact , at the present time women outnumber men at university and also obtain better results .
That is why I voted against this report .
Such a law is incompatible with full membership of the EU .
I also asked for a second airport to be opened up for planes arriving with equipment , in other words Pathein airport which is a military airport .
I think the best alternative is the Security Council .
It became evident how heartless the ruling Burmese generals were when they refused international aid to save the Burmese people , even though the generals themselves were unable to do so .
This is unbelievable and a heartbreaking denial of the Burmese people &apos;s most basic human right .
Numerous foreign teams including those from Japan , Taiwan , Korea and Australia are already there , or are about to set out for China .
What should the international community do ?
I also saw the immediate large @-@ scale help provided to the victims by ordinary people , the government and the army .
I would say that this is a rather good illustration of the current situation in the world .
Some 70 % of the territory of Iraq is contaminated and even today we are not certain of the extent of the terrible human cost of depleted uranium .
In other words , even once the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect , provided it is ratified by all the Member States , Ireland , or any other Member State , will continue to have the right to veto any matter concerning taxes .
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , you made a reference to coastal patrol ; are you and the Council aware of the fact that there is only an occasional inspector on duty at the harbours and airports of the Atlantic coast in the west of Ireland ?
( DE ) Mr President , allow me to inform the Council that Question Time normally lasts for an hour and a half ; when we complain to the Bureau , we are invariably told that Question Times which last for only one hour are the exception .
The speed of technological change is breathtaking .
This may cause serious difficulties , particularly in relation to the operation of SMEs .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Sacconi has certainly put me in a slightly awkward situation .
The strategy envisages a new legislative framework in the form of a general animal health law to be supplemented by implementing acts of a primarily technical nature .
Unfortunately the Commission is not really singing along with that .
Can I just say , on the issue of food imports from third countries which has been mentioned in practically every contribution , that there is a real belief among EU producers that a blind eye is turned to the standards of food produced outside our borders .
The farmer usually pays too , because for it to be profitable to transport the animals so far , they have to be bought cheaply from the farmer .
That is a crucial point .
If we try to put all that together in a European Training Foundation it would drain the life out of the training schemes in many countries .
Today &apos;s debate is , therefore , very important in that it can pass on a strong message to the General Affairs and External Relations Council next week .
There are many analyses from the World Bank , the IMF , the UN and others that document the fact that the common agricultural policy is undermining the opportunities open to developing countries to grow , and here I am not talking about export subsidies , which are grotesque enough but only account for a small fraction of the destruction being caused by this policy .
Two years ago I presented a first report on aid effectiveness in this very Chamber .
A few weeks ago I visited the IMF and the World Bank on behalf of the Committee on Development and at that meeting I asked what the world would be like between 2030 and 2050 .
It is important to remember that .
This significant political breakthrough , which was achieved through the skilful and effective mediation of the Arab League , and especially of the Government of Qatar , paves the way for the election of General Michel Suleiman as President of the Republic of Lebanon in the coming days , the creation of a government of national unity and the adoption of an improved electoral law .
Oral explanations of vote
Let us not forget that it is SMEs , through their innovation and flexibility , that provide a significant boost to economic growth and improvements in the competitiveness of European business .
in writing . - ( FR ) At a time of extremely worrying food price surges it is more necessary than ever for the European Parliament to adopt a resolution .
Other international organisations are better equipped to coordinate humanitarian aid .
In our view it is not for the European Parliament to make recommendations on the matter .
The warrants relate to 51 counts of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Belarus is located in an area that is strategically important for the Unites States and for NATO .
Political arrests and repressions are continuing .
Therefore , we have made our wishes clear .
In this connection , I must tell you that the rule is that it will be possible to increase this level of funding only if Burundi has properly taken up all the funds allocated under the initial aid package .
While aspiring to be a global power and a global actor , we should change the balance between being a payer , as we are and we want to be , and being a key player in the world arena .
An important decision was taken .
In the context of the future Treaty , we are calling for a reinforcement of the budgetary powers of Parliament in all areas of EU spending .
They envisage combining existing multinational forces and that there should be a standing force under EU command .
Here I expect concrete suggestions to be made so that , in the future , there will be closer cooperation and so that such projects and shortcomings will be solved together in the European way .
If you believe this is what the European people want , why will you not let them vote on the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty which are designed to deliver it ?
It is also important to consider the Treaty of Lisbon , which will , I trust , enter into force as soon as possible and be the foundation for new EU actions , and to ensure that one of its outcomes is a set of instruments that are as efficient as possible .
Then the European Union will have the opportunity to move from being a global payer towards becoming a global player .
This had a very positive effect on the report .
in writing . - The report of Mr Saryusz @-@ Wolski reaffirms the European Union &apos;s commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals , but this phrase in itself has become a little shallow , as it is being used lavishly in the EU development policy discourse , when very little progress is actually made and the MDGs are still beyond our reach .
I realise that the debate about this has sometimes been very emotional , obviously without full knowledge of the background and circumstances .
Will you say something about this to the Americans or will you back the demands of US citizens on the issue ?
On the one hand , these measures affect the free movement of the citizens of my country and primarily the opportunities for young people to have the same rights and chance which people of their age enjoy in other countries ; on the other hand , they generate economic problems for countries like Bulgaria , which have relatively small ports and will have to shoulder the heavy financial burden of providing the new screening equipment .
It is a very welcome development that the United States have committed to creating the basis for the post @-@ Kyoto regime .
The former authorities of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management say that the application by the Lux Veritatis Foundation was checked very carefully and not found wanting in any way .
Sadly , today &apos;s newspapers are full of headlines about Czech drivers being hassled by German and Austrian police .
In other words : must a state that was once a beneficiary always remain a beneficiary ?
We call for five things : let us abolish agricultural subsidies ; let us abolish agricultural tariffs ; let us liberalise rules of origin ; let us stop supporting corrupt governments through direct budgetary support and place more emphasis on aid for trade , so that we can invest in things like infrastructure ; and let us incentivise low @-@ income countries to remove barriers between each other .
Nine resolutions were adopted .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
A non @-@ confidential version of the MasterCard decision is published on our website , so we are transparent and we are clear .
However , responsibilities are also bound up with this right .
Then there is the missing definition of e @-@ commerce : cross @-@ border money transfers are working , but there are barriers when opening an account and to other rights , which we must remove .
Partnership agreements should also be a tool for achieving this , with the corresponding technical assistance and training , in order to create not new barriers to trade , but rather measures that are effective for all the parties involved .
Should subsequent legislation not bear in mind the possibility of making the penalty level dependent on the fish stocks and binding catch quotas for species caught ?
Admittedly , when we see the resentment that exists towards the European Union , we realise to what extent Member States and a number of industry members have shirked their responsibilities over the years , prioritising short @-@ term interests , thinking that they can profit from these for a while , but refusing to see that , by doing so , they led an entire sector to the brink of disaster .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Freitas on his excellent report .
The Commission is still convinced at this stage that a trade facilitation agreement should remain one of the pillars of the conclusion of the Doha Round , and should not be removed from it .
I would like to extend our thanks to the Commission staff that I have worked with , as well as members of the Committee on International Trade , such as Mr Musquar , and rapporteurs from the political groups , such as Mr Assis .
We also know that trafficking in women no longer stops at borders .
A country where there is significant demand plays an equally active part in trafficking as an origin country .
We will of course have to see whether this really works , but that is the idea in any case .
Mutual political solidarity is called for when designing the eastern and southern aspects of neighbourhood policy .
Could this be because there is actually no basis for this agreement in the Treaties ?
Finally , the Commission has now applied the brakes to Mr Sarkozy &apos;s ambitious plans for the secretariat and leadership structure of the project .
It is true , too , Mrs Isler @-@ Béguin , that the partners clearly have to want to dance .
I regret the fact that , while micro @-@ businesses are taxable , the exemption of SMEs is hidden in the text .
The proposal came from the Enterprise and Industry DG as part of the Better Regulation initiative .
There has to be an explanation for that .
The United States must realise that there is a great difference between the interests of NATO on the one hand , and the interests of the European Union and the people of Europe on the other hand .
On this occasion , I invite the Romanian rightist government to assume in public the failure of its programmes in the fight against corruption .
Preservation of marine biodiversity will only be guaranteed if it is integrated vertically into the other Community policies , notably the EU &apos;s future maritime policy .
At the same time , the EU Food Safety Directive is allowing oils and other liquid cargoes intended for human consumption to be carried by container ships transporting petroleum oils and other toxic fluids .
in writing . - ( PT ) Among the various important aspects that could be highlighted in relation to this resolution , I must point out the profound hypocrisy of those who are currently reiterating their full support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a state when they are the same ones who instigated and supported the illegal and illegitimate &apos; operation &apos; by the US @-@ NATO @-@ EU against Yugoslavia .
Our military resources are reduced to their simplest expression because the bulk of the budgets is today spent by France and the United Kingdom and subject to the Stability Pact .
Instead , it supports the EU &apos;s imperialist plans for the wider region of the Mediterranean and the Middle East .
Young people are not considering farming as a career option because , in many cases , issues such as the succession of farms and difficulties associated with obtaining credit simply outweigh the benefits of starting out .
That does not seem to be the case for a cross @-@ border retail financial services market , however .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , I should like to propose that the title &apos; Preparation for the European Council &apos; be expanded to : &apos; Preparation for the European Council after the Irish referendum &apos; .
However , I would also like to comment on and have recorded in this Chamber the urgent need to eradicate the terrorist violence perpetrated by ETA against the media and guarantee the full exercise of freedom of expression .
While many of us who voted or campaigned for a &apos; yes &apos; vote are disappointed in the result , I think it is important that we reflect on that result .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - Madam President , Caroline Jackson referred to a quotation I think from Jack Nicholson .
Twenty years is almost half a generation .
According to the statistics , every community could basically achieve a 50 % reduction in the waste it produces as soon as it introduces dry waste recycling and separate door @-@ to @-@ door collection of organic waste .
Or we can agree perhaps to some minor amendment , or to an amendment which is characterised by its movers as minor , such as Amendment 88 on which I await the Commission &apos;s opinion , perhaps overnight .
But we also see reports from the European Environment Agency that there are many instances of Member States still failing to enforce the legislation as effectively and as adequately as should be the case .
First , it requires much more transparency from governments .
A further EUR 1.6 billion will be available from the rural development funds to restore forest resources and initiate preventive actions .
This resolution must also make a firm request to Council to adopt a decision on the proposed Regulation of the Solidarity Fund , to facilitate a quicker and more effective response to disasters that Member States are unable to deal with alone .
However , the correct work of customs forms the basis for the success of our single market and the free movement of goods , persons , capital and services .
We must ensure that our 27 Member States work together more closely : that they liaise , share information and make Europe work better and more smoothly for legitimate business ; and that we do crack down on the serious and growing problem of counterfeit and pirated goods entering our market .
As MEPs , we have paid close attention to the correct enforcement of Community legislation on equal opportunities .
Employment is of course important , but so are education , social security systems and a regional policy which devotes attention to neglected areas .
Consequently , I welcome the initiative to make the problem of poverty more visible and the effort to establish a single coordinated policy .
Would it not be much more appropriate to deal with the problems of rural areas in the context of cohesion policy and using cohesion policy instruments , allowing agricultural policy measures to play a purely complementary role ?
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has insisted on the usefulness of this broader approach , but has not been heeded .
In addition , among the problems faced by European cohesion policy at the beginning of the 21st century , are issues that are external in character , such as , for example , the growing development differences between the European Union and the USA .
The agricultural policy shamelessly allowed our surpluses , such as sugar and grain , to be dumped on the world market with export subsidies .
However , I must of course say a few other things .
That is our duty as MEPs .
Mr President , the result of last week &apos;s referendum in Ireland shows that the people feel that the European Union is not addressing their worries sufficiently , and if we also look at the ongoing surveys , like Eurobarometer , for example , we find that immigration is among the greatest worries of EU citizens ; EU citizens want more of Europe , not less , but the answer that we have given so far is not good enough .
It is fairly clear that an immigrant , since he enters a country illegally , has a liability to abscond .
The unsupportive Europe is therefore going to be consolidated .
We have been waiting for them for quite some time .
The restrictions are very strict .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , tomorrow we must vote on a text that Member States and the more conservative amongst us are billing as a compromise .
There is above average unemployment in some regions while in others , there are too few skilled workers .
The Slovak economy is in the process of catching up with the rest of the European Monetary Union .
As a Czech Member of this Parliament , I want to congratulate Slovakia on its accession to the eurozone .
I am completely open about that and always have been .
I welcome the compromise that was reached .
It is therefore necessary to create a factual image of the state of development of our regions and to use this as a basis for getting to grips with difficult areas within individual regions .
Decoupling waste from our growing economies is vital .
in writing . - ( NL ) Mr President , Belgium has been a forerunner on waste policy for years and so , personally , I would have preferred a rather more ambitious text .
We are convinced that these financial resources would do more good in the national budgets of Member States , where they would make a real contribution to the urgent fight against poverty and social exclusion .
They have been responsible for loss of income for small and medium @-@ sized farmers , absenteeism and the abandonment of agricultural activity , favouring large landowners only .
A consistent and effective approach is ensured at all levels , especially as regards transmission network operators , in an open and transparent consultation process , as well as all the main players and the agency .
They have suggested the strengthening of these Chinese walls .
I am convinced that the sharp rise in prices and the increasing helplessness of consumers has largely been due to the inadequate functioning of the market .
In the light of the Irish vote last weekend , it is also undesirable for a German @-@ French political cartel to work against the suggestions of Parliament and against the original suggestions by the Commission , as that is a classic trade @-@ off issue .
We need to learn a lesson from the experiences of the United States of America .
If a study comes to the conclusion that we are putting too much faith in the vague promises of Central Asian dictators and unconfirmed reports of petroleum stores in relation to the Nabucco pipeline project , then we will have to develop a constructive relationship with Iran which , after all , has the second @-@ largest petroleum reserves in the world .
We want interconnectors to be extended in order to permit cross @-@ border exchange .
This is sometimes of more relevance to national situations than to political and strategic choices .
As I see it , this European market in energy means that we must also be able to give consumers a European answer .
At the same time , production restrictions on a range of items leave no scope for competition , which could keep price rises down .
Are there consistent regulations on this ?
However , as we know , European SMEs are exposed to global competition .
There is a concern that certain EU policies to counter terrorism , particularly related to data retention , are not balanced against EU citizens &apos; fundamental right to privacy .
Against this background , we have requested various scientific opinions which have assessed the risk of the use of the four AMT substances from the point of view of health , environment and anti @-@ microbial resistance .
Now it is doing the same for its chickens .
The Commission proposal to authorise this for two years , followed by a review on the basis of new data , is of course totally at variance with this precautionary principle .
The issue of safety is a very important one to the people of Europe and I have personally undertaken to send a strong message to all the citizens of the European Union .
I hope that , in any case , citizens increasingly opt to travel by bicycle and on foot in their own conurbation instead of by car .
I am delighted with the report and with Mr Ferrari &apos;s proposals .
However , this does not mean that the existing system is ideal .
We are talking about small territories , in total a population of 4 million inhabitants , distributed in islands in the Pacific , the Atlantic and the Caribbean , which will find themselves in difficulty if special measures are not applied to them .
As I said last week , the Commission fully respects the outcome of the Irish referendum .
The European Union is founded on freedom of expression and democracy .
Certainly there is a role for Parliament and Commission in explaining the European Union - but also for every national government , every single day , not just when ratification of the latest treaty is due .
( Applause from certain quarters )
That is why we are here .
Why was it decided to offer this opportunity of a plebiscite , as we have heard ?
You say that anti @-@ Europeans ran up and down steps , went out canvassing .
In general terms it has been said - and I agree - that governments take credit when things go right , but when things go wrong or there are grounds for criticism , Europe is always to blame .
However , I do not agree with speculation and I believe that we should wait until the end of the ratifications .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , I am trying to summarise that we need to create a citizen &apos;s ownership of EU policies , to make them understandable and relevant , and to make the EU institutions accountable and reliable to those they serve .
That originally was the wish of Finland and many other countries .
The Lisbon Treaty is not just about institutional reform in the European Union ; the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights make Europe a genuine political community and a community of values .
So &apos; intercultural dialogue &apos; could be seen as a comprehensive term , including the various dimensions mentioned earlier on : interreligious dialogue and intra @-@ religious approaches , also when they involve atheistic non @-@ believers .
When average , theistic , atheistic and non @-@ theistic believers get together , some of them perhaps for the first time ever , they - hopefully - learn a lot from each other , even if they finally disagree on substantive issues .
Thank you .
Mr President , I too supported the Morgan report because I am convinced that we should be unbundling ownership fully in this particular sector , and the experience of Member States indicates that full ownership unbundling leads to increased investment and improved network performance .
A country &apos;s refugee policy is a strictly national matter and it must be decided within the context of the country &apos;s legal culture .
It is a sensible initiative , since we know that some countries have no rules or limits whatsoever for the detention of illegal aliens .
In any event , the basic issue is the liberalisation of the sector , which is why we could only vote against this report in the end .
in writing . - ( PL ) The rapporteur has prepared a very good and thorough report .
The statute on which we are voting today sets out new mechanisms to bolster the effectiveness of the Ombudsman &apos;s work .
There is an energy future for all of us .
Hauliers are demonstrating angrily , fishermen are demanding compensation , and transport is getting increasingly expensive .
But , as everybody expected oil prices to come down to USD 9 per barrel , the world was late , and now we know that we should follow this policy .
Given the exceptional situation being faced by the fisheries sector I trust I can count on the support of both the Council and the Parliament to adopt the said measures as speedily as possible .
They are suffering hardship without having any other options or means of overcoming the situation .
Mr President , in July 2007 I went to Castletownbere in West Cork , which is in the south @-@ western part of Ireland , and met with the fishing community there .
As regards the long @-@ standing problem of Siberian overflight fees , the EU will continue to press for signature of the existing agreement .
The logical result then may be a stalemate like in chess .
Mr President , the negotiations will not be easy .
( DE ) Mr President , I also take the view that the pipeline between Germany and Russia should only be built if the other EU Member States concerned agree .
This is not an anti @-@ Russian policy .
Within the context of these recommendations , the education and training of health workers was highlighted as one of the main areas .
The European Union is aware of the potential influence of the production of biofuels on food prices .
The Council and the Commission accepted these amendments .
So this report will put responsibility on national governments .
Despite these arguments , the Committee on Transport and Tourism rejected the Commission &apos;s original proposal in its entirety by a very narrow majority of just one vote , drawing attention to the Member States &apos; rights of subsidiarity .
The results so far are not very satisfactory .
I am also pleased that we have succeeded in ensuring that the text makes specific reference to central reservations and crash barriers , which prevent injury and death among vulnerable users , such as motorists , since the rise in their number today actually generates new accidents .
Finally , the setting @-@ up of an EU implementation task force comprising members of the European Commission , the presidency and the Council .
Of course the causes are well known : massive increase in the cost of feed , reduced consumption levels , the difficult life of the sheep farmer , catarrhal fever , falling prices , decoupling of aid and , above all , duty @-@ free imports of mutton and lamb from New Zealand .
This laboratory , I note , is the same place from where the virus escaped a few months earlier , causing an outbreak in the UK with devastating results for the farmers there .
We have a duty to consider this initiative a political priority ; citizens are watching us and young people in particular are expecting us to provide them with answers , advice , suggestions and ideas so that they can use the European Union &apos;s roads without running the risk of losing their lives .
Most of us use vehicles on these roads .
In this context we organised a hearing as part of our deliberations in the Committee on Transport and Tourism , where we were told by the industry representatives - not entirely surprisingly - that anything was possible .
We ask the Commission to draw up an appropriate , cross @-@ sectoral strategy to facilitate implementation of intelligent transport systems .
I must stress how very important this is .
Madam President , how wonderful it is to see you in the chair .
It is therefore very important to harmonise the requirements for the various forms of transport .
In the interests of free trade , therefore , I have voted against this report , which I consider to be motivated by protectionism .
I think that cars with the lowest CO2 emissions should be marketed using social campaigns .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PL ) Mr President , a year has not yet passed and this is the third time that we have debated the situation in Burma .
We are not up to confrontation for the sake of confrontation .
That cannot be the way to eradicate murders , rapes and famine .
This is completely immoral and indefensible and is a policy that will inevitably lead us to a confrontation , to war , if we do not challenge it quickly .
I trust that the European Parliament and all EU partners will agree to this line and act accordingly .
This system error is at our cost .
At the same time as having the globally @-@ created problem of the price of fuel , we also have the European institutions and European regulations saying that fish which are caught and which are a viable food commodity have to be thrown overboard and discarded simply because they are not part of a quota .
I think that we need to clarify two points .
Of course the Irish should be treated exactly the same as the French and Dutch , and we look forward to a constructive package of proposals from Mr Cowen .
The way forward is for Europe to demonstrate that , as a Union , it can seriously get to grips with the financial crisis , climate change and sustainability , with economic recession , with decent working conditions and with energy security and fuel costs .
The Directorate @-@ General for Transport has also already written you a letter .
We currently have mechanisms that are the same , adapted in parts , as for a base that was significantly smaller and different during the Cold War .
Let us not apologise for defending the Lisbon Treaty that tries to reinforce accountability , democracy , the coherence and effectiveness of our Union .
Europe will have to adapt not only to climate change but also to high energy prices .
Today , one third of children have an allergy and , if we do not do something about it , in time half the European population will suffer from this illness .
Such actions , however , are passed over with silence when it comes to the country of the former Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs .
The Greeks , and European fishermen generally , are subject to stringent restrictions - and rightly so - regarding fishing methods and tools , fishing times , etc .
Secondly , I reject the approach chosen by the Commission , which is already proposing to use the flexibility instrument and emergency aid for expenditure that is actually predictable and planned .
My group will support the tripartite amendment on climate change , and will wait with interest to find out what lies behind the surprising fall in the level of payments .
Secondly , we need considerable further discussion about whether to proceed by simply giving these funds to the United Nations or the World Bank without having access to the internal audits and without certain guarantees with respect to correct political priorities .
Thus , I consider that the report has largely emphasized the budgetary insufficiencies regarding the fight against global warming , but it has not insisted enough on the problem of the food crisis that European Union citizens are dealing with .
It is in the interests of airlines and consumers , as well as governments , to maintain a high level of healthy competition in the aircraft sector .
The union Unite and the management in the United Kingdom are united in insisting that we put as much pressure as possible on the United States over this matter .
To conclude , the Commission , in particular Vice @-@ President Jacques Barrot , continues to be in regular contact with the Italian authorities who have undertaken to provide a full report on this subject by the end of July .
Mr President , this is the fourth time in the last few months that we have spoken on the same issue .
( Protests )
The Roma camps and the Roma communities are illegal and immoral .
The common authorisation procedure will establish a system for assessing and authorising additives , enzymes and flavourings in a consistent manner .
Food additives , flavourings and enzymes play an important role in the manufacture of our food .
Information on this subject must be clearly marked on the pack , and also drawn up in language that is clear and comprehensible to the consumer .
Naturally , however , we have seen that not everyone has shared this opinion , and I am convinced that , in a European Parliament where there are very many different colours , very many kinds of political party and very many kinds of political persuasion , efforts must always be made to reach some sort of consensus on this matter .
( NL ) The rapporteur has actually said himself what this report is about : it is about the European Parliament further intensifying its role as a kind of representative of eurocratic one @-@ dimensional thinking , and doing away with the modicum of freedom enjoyed by the smaller political groups .
Mr Corbett could be in charge , for example , of unseating anyone who did not share his views .
I hear that we spend only 17.4 % of our time on legislative work : this is not enough .
We also now have the option of the simplified procedure where the rapporteur simply makes a two @-@ minute statement at the time of the vote : we will keep that .
( Applause )
The fact that hazardous chemical substances would enter the sea during the laying of the pipeline also adds to the concerns .
( PL ) Mr President , the planned northern gas pipeline joining Russia and Germany is to be the longest twin pipe undersea gas pipeline in the world , and also the shallowest , which makes it particularly susceptible to possible damage .
With the experience Mr Landsbergis has of the political preconditions for a region to be created and shaped in a climate of security , I think we all have reason to listen when he speaks .
I can in no way agree that the natural environment in Europe can be made slave to EU external energy policy , when in recent years Europe has spoken out forcefully for environmental protection .
The first is that the Council hopes that the Afghan Government will assume a greater share of the responsibility for Afghanistan &apos;s reconstruction and development process .
The resolution has been altered and now describes a country where there was reportedly a massive turnout at the elections , forgetting that the population voted under continuing threat from armed groups .
It would be much better if the rapporteur instead stated clearly that Parliament supports local and international terrorism and considers the presence of NATO forces to be an obstacle to ensuring the country &apos;s Taliban future .
However , no global agreement can be reached if no one is willing to lead this worldwide effort .
I saw it with my own eyes on a visit to Greenland last year .
It would not be right for this to be just discrimination against European carriers and European passengers , particularly in the new Member States .
7 . Protocol on the Accession of Liechtenstein to the EU / EC / Switzerland Agreement on Switzerland &apos;s association with the Schengen acquis (
Authorised and competent authorities should decide whether or not to permit the use of substances that enhance the flavour , appearance or nutritional properties of products on the basis of scientific knowledge and a risk assessment .
It was when she had the budget the last time that I managed to table just under 500 amendments to her budget for discussion in committee , and a number of those came forward to plenary .
That would be a big mistake .
in writing . - Today Parliament voted in favour of the health and protection of EU consumers .
It is necessary to conclude an international agreement , and for that reason the EU must negotiate with the US , Russia and China .
The Baltic Sea is sensitive and is already under severe environmental pressure . It is therefore of the utmost importance that the environmental impact can be kept to a strict minimum if permission is to be given for the pipeline to be built .
I would see it differently .
On the contrary , the Agency needs guidelines to frame its powers so that it can take individual binding decisions on market players .
It seems that there is full agreement as regards another great challenge and issue , namely the capture and storage of carbon dioxide .
The EU has no common gas market ; it is very fragmented and mainly regional .
Finally , I wish to lend my wholehearted support to the Paparizov gas regulation report and express my gratitude to Mr Paparizov for his splendid assistance to us during the first reading .
The first concerns long @-@ term contracts .
Of course , when prices are higher awareness of the delicate nature of climate change is heightened .
In the end , I would like to congratulate our three colleagues for the manner in which they have managed the drafting of reports .
This does not mean that the energy market is the same in every area .
The number and size of these funds is currently growing rapidly .
One of the problems of state @-@ owned funds is their enormous growth .
( FR ) Mr President , we know that it will not be easy , but I can tell Mr Moraes that from a legal perspective we are working diligently to ensure that it is implemented and that the Presidency , for its part , will make every effort to see that this Commission package is applied .
Subject : Establishment of asset recovery offices
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( FR ) Mr President , Mr Evans , the Council shares your concerns about the situation in Sri Lanka .
This result was obtained following several lengthy meetings and enormous efforts by all those involved .
In so doing , through this piece of legislation , we are approaching the concept of Community railways , that is , common technical , operational and legal standards , in effect , interoperability , which is needed from every point of view .
We want to introduce substantial simplifications for the consumer , which are long overdue .
We should also remember that flights start and end at airports , so a good service culture at airports is also essential .
Europe will not be successful if it interferes in every area of people &apos;s lives .
( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what are we actually doing here ?
The current , proposed rules will continue to authorise these belts , disregarding the fact that far more stringent safety provisions apply to children even in cars , in most European states at least .
Where children up to the age of 14 can travel by train for free , it is also the other passengers who contribute to that cost .
We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead .
To recognise the situation is not to be defeatist , but rather to show good sense .
Today it is facing the new challenge of establishing its increasingly important role in the globalised world .
( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the euro is an increasingly expensive currency by comparison with those of our main partners and competitors .
Thirdly , how to monitor financial markets in order to avoid a repetition of the crisis in mortgage lending ?
To be successful now , you have to think about future generations , not vice versa .
rapporteur . - ( NL ) Ladies and gentlemen , we are voting today on a proposal to coordinate European social security more clearly and more flexibly and we are thus voting in favour of clarifying the annex .
In several places these reports claim to simplify regulations and modernise existing legislation for social security authorities , employers and citizens , while being very inclusive .
Millions of citizens work in other countries than their own and should benefit from the legal social rights due to them and their families .
Proposal for a Council regulation instituting a temporary specific action aiming to promote the restructuring of the European Union fishing fleets affected by the economic crisis - C6 @-@ 0270 / 2008 -
I sincerely believe that the regulation will truly make it possible to revoke the operating licences of companies that cheat customers by giving just their tariffs without any taxes , fees or fuel surcharges and therefore not giving the full price of air tickets .
Work on improvements in efficiency and energy savings has also become much more important .
This continues to reflect my appreciation of the very special case which these companies represent .
Limiting the levels of MEE and BEE in various types of detergents or cleaning products is a very positive step and for this reason I believe that the European Union should make every effort and commitment to eliminate these unhealthy substances from our lives and from the environment .
in writing . - I support Richard Corbett &apos;s report amending the Rules of Procedure regarding the formation of political groups .
in writing . - ( FI ) Mr President , Mr Rack &apos;s report on a new culture of urban mobility , in favour of which we have voted , is an important part of the new comprehensive approach of the Commission &apos;s energy and climate package : significant reductions in emissions can be achieved in Europe using sensible , efficient community and transport planning .
President @-@ in @-@ Office . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , China is a strategic partner of the European Union .
Enough is enough !
Many Heads of State or Government have not yet acted on the recommendation made by our European Parliament that they refrain from attending the opening ceremony for the Olympic Games .
( PL ) Mr President , many countries and their leaders , including those in Europe , are keen to have good contacts with China in order to obtain lucrative contract or economic agreements , paying scant attention to the lack of democracy and the failure to respect human rights in China .
But who is aware today that Norway is a party to the Schengen Accords and that Switzerland contributes to the Union &apos;s structural policy in the new Member States ?
Perhaps it should also be said that those who expected the European Parliament to announce an end to EU enlargement and to introduce some substitute for full accession have been disappointed .
All the same , a sort of tiredness and apathy with enlargement can be felt more and more in public opinion .
I should therefore like to single out one aspect of Mr Elmar Brok &apos;s report and that is the need to introduce a comprehensive communication strategy for informing the public about the purpose of enlargement , about its advantages as well as its potential future disadvantages .
Of course , in strict legal terms , this is true at the moment , but , at the same time , we should make a clear distinction between the Lisbon Treaty and enlargement .
The Western Balkan countries , Moldova , Ukraine and Turkey are countries that have stated their interest in joining the EU and that benefit from privileged partnerships with the EU , but also have to solve , at an internal level , compliance with the European standards , democracy , stability and prosperity .
The Lisbon Treaty provides the answer to these ideals and , without it , further enlargement of the Union becomes much more difficult .
I hope that it will ultimately bring positive results , but I fear not , because it is quite apparent that those who wish to destroy Israel as a state are gaining strength from politicians like Mrs Morgantini who table resolutions like this one at this moment in time .
Instead we are seeking closer partnership with Israel .
In other words , in our view the political solution will involve a coalition government led by Mr Tsvangirai as Prime Minister , endowed with the most extensive powers and , moreover , relying on the majority that he holds in Parliament .
There has to be an additional mediator .
in writing . - The recent elections in Zimbabwe were a sham with Mugabe being the only eventual candidate , having intimated Tsvangirai and other members of the MDC to the point of withdrawal .
It is the requirement to face up to that and to move as speedily as we can to second @-@ generation and even third @-@ generation which the Commission should be focusing upon .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , Mr Ryan , I am very grateful to you for this question because it addresses a problem with which the Commission has been deeply concerned for years : how to reduce unnecessary red tape for small and medium enterprises in Europe .
When we complete the project , as we will do over the next five months , every region in Europe will have one of those facilities .
Closer cooperation can be of great benefit here .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Mr President , this report opens by saying &apos; the various political and security challenges which the European Union is increasingly facing make an autonomous European Space Policy a strategic necessity &apos; .
on behalf of the PPE @-@ DE Group . - ( NL ) The fisheries agreement with Mauritania , concluded as recently as 1 August 2006 , was due to be extended this year .
In future applicants for visas will be identified beyond any doubt by the collection of biometric data such as photographs and fingerprints .
Obviously , Mr Borg , we too have accepted the urgency out of respect for our fisheries sector .
I would also like to think that the reduced carbon dioxide emissions from such a new contribution to the fleet should be able to be banked by Member States to contribute to their effort @-@ sharing under the climate package , which is rapidly coming down the track towards us , and we should connect the climate package with Member States &apos; efforts in relation to energy @-@ efficient vessels , smaller vessels and trading down in this particular area .
The total financial requirement is estimated to be in the region of EUR 2 billion .
As for the other aspects , I am unable to say at this point whether these will fully answer the questions asked by the Commission .
And now in the vote we have just had , we see this quite bizarre refusal even to consider the facts of the case .
I am aware that two fishing companies from Malta have used this agreement to fish in the Atlantic .
in writing . - I voted in favour of postponement of the vote on this sensitive report , believing that it would be more appropriate to wait until all of the information requested by the Commission from the Italian Government was available to us .
I also hope that our Community diplomacy will move to support the African Union &apos;s proposal asking for a government of national unity to overcome this difficult crisis .
It was a tiring trip , so I shall make no further preliminary remarks .
If we do not , we will not have any leverage to get the Chinese , Indians , emerging countries and Americans to make the efforts that we have agreed on .
( Applause )
This is why the Commission wanted to put forward a balanced proposal and why it has outlined 10 key principles so that we can go forward together .
( Applause from the left )
It is not the European people who have to reconcile with Brussels , it is Brussels that has to reconcile with the European people !
China , India , Brazil , Mexico - the big emerging countries - cannot say , &apos; Open up your borders , reduce your subsidies , but here we will do what we want . &apos; 
That is the true social Europe .
You are going to Dublin on 21 July .
All of this proves that European initiatives to combat climate change will continue to be in vain without comparable efforts from the Americans , the Chinese and the other industrialised nations .
President @-@ in @-@ Office , the Italian Government and people are watching your mandate attentively and trustingly , in the certainty that the history and social standing that you represent today will inject hope and development into Europe .
I would like to conclude with a few words on the dangerous phenomenon of the re @-@ nationalisation of Europe .
Allow me to say that it is all very well to say , &apos; in my country I do not want identity cards and I do not want a common immigration policy &apos; , but this does not stop you from being quite happy for foreigners whose papers are not in order to be stopped in France so that you do not have them in the United Kingdom .
Firstly , as President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , I must loyally defend the Union &apos;s position .
EU citizens are the subject of actions taken by Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
Mr Leinen , in your view , should I consider that the forty petitioners should be present in the Chamber as Rule 149 ( 4 ) implies , or can I consider that a prior written request alone is sufficient , as Rule 149 ( 3 ) implies ?
However , as far as today is concerned , given the importance of the debates , and given the opinions that you have given me , which clearly largely support what I have just said , and on the basis of the previous decisions , we are going to have our debates , and when it comes to the vote , if the forty petitioners are not present , I will not ask for the quorum to be checked .
We not only condemn unlawful killings and disappearances , but also insist that the Indian Government carry out a thorough independent investigation into the mass graves , having protected them in order to preserve the evidence .
Today we are looking at a massive regression , and there is a political crisis .
The military are now committed to withdrawing from policy @-@ making .
The debate is closed .
Symbolically the Russian authorities preferred to mark the start of the Beijing Olympics by launching an armed invasion of a neighbouring country .
We must prevent these situations from being systematically repeated .
You wanted to start your part @-@ session with a joint debate on justice issues .
The Eurojust decision states when the Member States &apos; judicial authorities - in other words the EJN contact points - must inform Eurojust about specific cases .
Now to my final point which I will keep short : we hear a great deal about what is needed to facilitate the work of the investigation authorities .
I know that you are a demanding advocate of this cooperation .
This more flexible system may operate for a maximum of three years , after which an evaluation of its effectiveness will take place .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not wish to go into too much detail , but it is true that we are considering a series of amendments .
Ceasefire as quickly as possible was our aim .
Finally , at the request of the Germans , Poles and a number of other countries , the end is worded as follows : We call on Russia to join with us in making this fundamental choice in favour of mutual interest , understanding and cooperation .
Russia has made no such attempt .
In adopting our position , let us remember that today , the first of September , is the International Day of Peace .
Who do we believe ?
However , we were immediately caught up by a small wave of panic .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Thanks to its Presidency , the Union has been more effective and quicker off the mark than Washington .
It is therefore essential for the European Union to apply itself far more effectively and intensively than previously to the entire region of the Eastern Mediterranean and Transcaucasus .
At the same time , we agree that there should be peacekeeping forces , but we are not talking about what the basis would be for a lasting solution , and this would only be extensive autonomy for the Abkhazians and South Ossetians under the Ahtisaari plan .
First of all , all decisions should be based upon compliance with Georgia &apos;s territorial integrity and the international law .
This is needed so that democratic Europe still has a clear message today !
The Commission has always conceived the CFR as a tool for better law @-@ making .
This is the gist of the report that we are debating tonight .
We as legislators need to make sure that consumers receive information and are free to make the choice of whether to take certain protection against a certain risk or not , rather than to impose a uniform level on all of them .
Firstly , it has been estimated that tax losses due to fiscal fraud relating to VAT and excise duty amount to more than 2 % of the European Union &apos;s GDP .
An equally important step in the fight against fiscal fraud is to update the availability of inter @-@ State information , a process which would be assisted by the establishment of a pan @-@ European e @-@ tax administration information centre .
Because the knowledge @-@ based economy , the innovation economy , can only be built by focusing firmly on developing human capital and on lifelong learning .
What you are initiating , Mr Špidla , is good , and we welcome it .
This social package contains no announcement of the inclusion , wherever necessary , of a social progress clause in all European treaties .
Operatives in this field are confused .
However , the rivalry of poverty has taken on a new dimension .
Mr President , the Commission &apos;s first year report on the European Globalisation Fund states that over 13 000 redundant employees in eight Member States are being helped .
But , having said that , I am delighted to be able to stand here and say that we are at long last on our way to seeing all EU citizens treated as equals .
We all know what the problem is there .
I do not know what has been discussed already but let me start by saying that we naturally welcome the social package .
Attempting to limit early school @-@ leaving combats poverty .
The strong consensus obtained in the LIBE Committee was crucial and should be reiterated here and now .
I hope that we shall receive an appropriate proposal before this parliamentary term is over and that the proposals from the Austrian and German Governments will be endorsed .
The goal of the lifelong learning programme should be the maintaining of a flexible , autonomous society , based on knowledge , with a quantity and quality economic @-@ cultural development , all following a line and in the spirit of a strong ( er ) social cohesion .
Therefore I am voting in favour .
Situated in the middle of the Mediterranean , they are receiving a disproportionate number of irregular immigrants .
in writing . - I would like to thank Mr Mladenov , our Committee rapporteur .
We are proposing a budget of EUR 134 billion in commitment appropriations , which amounts to EUR 469 million less than in the preliminary draft budget .
We hope that when the Commission makes promises on behalf of the European Union at the next Conference of Donors they will be discussed with the budgetary authorities beforehand .
I can tell you now that the Council essentially agrees with the rapporteur &apos;s view that a coordinated approach to the use of spectrum at European level will ensure the optimal use of the digital dividend .
This is the result of a collective effort .
Thirdly , the precise distribution of frequencies should not be laid down until numerous preliminary questions have been answered . Does responsibility lie with the EU ?
Furthermore , customers must have the right to be fully informed both of the legal obligations arising from the use of a given service , for example with respect to author &apos;s rights , and of the legally imposed restrictions .
The proposals of the lobby groups which have been accepted by all groups apart from the European United Left - which was the only group to vote against in the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection - open up opportunities for controlling downloads and free access , for example to websites such as MySpace and YouTube .
Research into optimisation and allocation of dividend is another important issue .
Allow me to dwell , however , on one particular point in the Harbour report .
I would also like to thank the Commission very much , especially the Commissioner , for the awareness she has always shown in what I would term her fireproof advocacy of a more competitive electronic communications market and consumer protection .
President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council . - ( FR ) In reply to Mr Allister let me say that I do indeed believe that food security must be a prime objective of our review of the common agricultural policy .
I would say to Mrs Doyle that the question she raised is a very wide @-@ ranging one .
It is , I believe , supposed to end next March .
All of us come into daily contact with his work , since the Committee on Petitions is the body which Parliament has made responsible for relations with the Ombudsman .
We must continue with our efforts and strengthen the legal base .
Without them , our commitments are only words and the legislation is useless .
It is immensely important for a woman who has had a baby to be provided with support that gives her and her child the necessary security and ensures that she is not prevented from returning to professional or social life .
Instead , the Council and the European Parliament are in fact proposing the BERT recommendation , with fundamental responsibility for better implementation of the regulatory framework for telecommunications services , without getting involved in issues of network security or integrity .
on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( FR ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report is not as anodyne as the late hour at which it is being debated might suggest and I want to thank Mrs Svensson for the work she has done and for her cooperation .
Since we are discussing a field falling under Community competence , namely trade in audiovisual services , I believe fines to be enforced by the European Commission to producers promoting discriminatory imagines through publicity should be introduced .
One thing is quite clear , namely that animal health equates with food safety .
I would like to mention a number of points .
I now come to my role as shadow rapporteur for the ALDE , and will outline some of the guiding principles of our approach .
The aim is to classify and label the thousands of substances and mixtures which surround us .
I request the Commission not to give up the proposal for enforcing the new regulation , during the entire product management cycle , including when the product becomes waste .
I should like first to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Weisgerber , for her constructive , successful work on this proposal .
It is true that the technical problems associated with the storage and handling of hydrogen require clear , unified regulations , including the labelling of systems working with hydrogen .
The debate is closed .
The number of fatalities rose , according to some estimates , to 350 000 people .
I voted in favour of the resolution , although I feel that the position of both the Commission and Parliament with regard to future relations with Russia has not been defined clearly enough .
The report legalises the production of hydrogen powered vehicles .
The EU could help to negotiate a solution that would be acceptable to all parties and , for example , speak up for generous ethnic minority rights for Russians in the post @-@ Soviet era , which would fit in with the European Union &apos;s oft @-@ quoted human rights goals .
To believe this , all you need to do is read the previous ones : the Kauppi report in 2007 or the Estrela report in 2006 on equality between men and women .
Analyses by independent experts often go unpublished , since they contradict political views .
That is why , ladies and gentlemen , the Council has drafted a concept paper on restrictive measures , entitled &apos; Basic principles on the use of restrictive measures &apos; , which mentions the attention paid to , I quote &apos; full respect of human rights and the rule of law &#91; ... &#93; in full conformity with our obligations under international law &apos; .
This is why sanctions are part of our foreign policy instrument palette , and this is why we do not shirk from applying them in a fairly free and , at times , inappropriate way .
( HU ) Thank you for the floor , Mr President .
An effective sanctions strategy is still lacking up to now .
On the other hand , they can have a tangible impact on the development of the target state .
The improvement in reproductive health and the abolition of any kind of discrimination against women are key and extremely important preconditions for achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015 .
If we drain specialists from the healthcare sector , short @-@ staffed as it is , women &apos;s health , the health of all members of society in general , will be endangered and in an even worse state .
Subject : Road safety
Price distortion in relation to product quality is a matter of concern to the consumer .
author . - Thank you , Commissioner , for dealing with this question .
But you also know that we have been asked by the European Council to have a specific eastern partnership as well , and we will be working on that - indeed , my services and I will , in late autumn , propose something more specific only with the eastern partners , without Turkey and Russia .
When a survey was conducted of state schools in India , some were simply shut .
The truth is that it has been interesting for this shadow rapporteur to follow this debate , which has confirmed why some of us are sitting in the centre of this House and not at one end or the other , why some of us sit here , in the middle .
On the one hand , there is the great potential for the European Union to open up its services sector to new markets , in which it has a major comparative and competitive advantage at global level : the development of new channels for the sector , one of the main tools with which Europe can face up to the challenge of globalisation .
In addition , all the CRS were controlled by airlines .
My sincere thanks once again to my fellow Members and the rapporteur .
How about Lufthansa , Air France and Iberia , with 44 % between them : is that a decisive influence ?
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats supports the European Commission and opposes the enforcement of thresholds advocated by our rapporteur .
( RO ) I would like to congratulate the Rapporteur for the work and effort submitted in drafting this document .
This kind of analysis is necessary in order to quickly eliminate the weak spots in the rail network and thus create greater capacity .
Cross @-@ border harmonisation of national rules and synergy with the other related policies are necessary conditions for the achievement of the objectives of sustainable and efficient freight transport .
For instance , new research projects have been funded by the Commission , a working group of experts has been set up and a Green Paper on tobacco smoke and scientific opinions have been approved .
I want to welcome this report from Ms. Ries .
We should invest in research , and then implement its findings .
So @-@ called double standards are not allowed , however .
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted an opinion which triggered a certain amount of controversy because the rapporteur who was appointed wanted to reject a directive .
We have heard much criticism of the project , alleging that it will increase bureaucracy or duplicate existing national and Community legislation .
Can we agree that I will make a statement at the end on what has been decided , so that we really can get on with the vote just now ?
That Islamisation is undeniable and puts a number of very fundamental European and Western values , fundamental rights and human rights at risk .
in writing . - ( IT ) Mr President , I am voting in favour of this document , but I wish to point out that it is the umpteenth text approved by this House in support of respect for human rights in this part of the world .
My attempts to draw attention to the fact were ignored , as was the case during five other roll @-@ call votes .
The European Union , which is the world &apos;s largest exporter and largest provider of services , has to promote greater access to the services market for both the developed nations and the developing countries alike .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
- ( NL ) Mr President , fragile democratic regimes in Africa which are overthrown by a military coup : it is a never @-@ ending story , a saga that goes on and on .
In addition , persecutions on political and / or theological grounds continue to occur frequently .
We must be very clear about one thing : the Iranian regime is a totalitarian regime , and we would like to see it come to an end .
There is a sizeable population of albinos in the world .
We also closely monitor the human rights situation in general in Tanzania , together with Member States and other development partners .
( The House rose and observed a minute &apos;s silence . )
( For the results and other details of the vote : see Minutes )
22 . Safety rules and standards for passenger ships ( recast ) (
( DE ) That is paragraph 22 .
Closure of the sitting
I extend a very warm welcome to you all in the European Parliament in the last month of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue .
( The Presidents signed the legal acts ) .
Documents received : see Minutes
I do however believe that , faced with the urgency of the situation in Gaza , it is extremely important for this House to give its opinion and say exactly what it wants , in order to end the massacres currently taking place in the Middle East .
Ladies and gentlemen , let this incident be a warning to you about what the Turkish mentality is like in the 21st century .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my frank amazement over the irony of fate that the Czech government , which is well @-@ known for its specific approach to the question of negotiations with Russia , has not yet torn asunder its veil and heaped ashes upon its head .
They must be used correctly in order to be effective - the right product and the right dosage at the right time .
Just as we , in my home country , have the groundwater that we want to look after , and that I choose to use as an example here , there are , of course , other countries with various other environmental and health @-@ related matters that they would like to protect and the EU must never force a country to lower its level of protection .
Aerial spraying is virtually prohibited and - where there are no viable alternatives - local people must be notified in advance of the composition , times , intensity and schedule of the spraying .
We should be very strict when it comes to poisons of this kind .
The result of the trialogue is a giant step forward compared to the result of our Parliament at the first reading .
So I bow to neither side nor extreme of this debate this evening , particularly those who fail to see the need for plant protection products in food production and those who say that these two pieces of legislation are a disaster for farming and the food production in Europe .
It is not simply a matter of measuring levels of residues in food .
rapporteur . - ( DE ) Madam President , I , too , would like to give my thanks for a lively debate .
To illustrate the importance of urban mobility , let me provide you with some figures : 60 % of the population lives in urban areas and 85 % of the EU GDP is created there .
The question that now arises in view of the delay is as follows . What was the European Commission aiming at by presenting the Green Paper ?
This concurs with our views ; both public and private broadcasting are important .
Moreover , this is a matter that falls within the competence of the Member States , not that of the European Union .
Mr President , when I first started work on this report , the first thing I did was pay a visit to my country &apos;s Economic Affairs Department in the Hague , where I was pleased to hear that the Dutch Government had taken on board a government @-@ to @-@ government approach .
The CAP will not remain static after 2013 , and the preliminary debate has already been engaged since the informal agricultural ministers meeting in Annecy in September .
It is essential , however , and I would like it to be guided by the following principles , or rather to guide itself by them .
All of these measures have been brought to the attention of the European institutions and individual Member States , however they should not undermine or weaken our outlook and our commitment on behalf of future generations .
In order for us to be successful , judicial authorities will have to reinforce cross @-@ border cooperation regarding misleading database services .
The Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality works intensively to draw attention to the fact that gender @-@ based discrimination still persists in many areas of social and political life .
However , it is necessary to ensure that the introduction of the passport for management companies is accompanied by the necessary guarantees , especially as regards the supervision of funds , as it leads to dissociation of functions beyond borders .
That will have an impact on the conditions for organising supervision between the stakeholders , in other words the producers and the consumers of UCITS .
It has increased price transparency , strengthened trade and promoted economic and financial integration .
As long as the currency exchange rates were fixed , the monetary system did not upset our attempt to create a common market .
This anniversary , then , gives us a particularly apt message of hope for today &apos;s times .
I must say quite honestly that , even if I am still not convinced by the Maastricht Treaty today , like all the other Greens , I am rather attracted by the changes which the legislation and application of Economic and Monetary Union have undergone .
Now we need to strengthen Europe &apos;s role in the supervision of the financial markets .
Madam President , I concur with the comments made by my excellent colleague Mr Syed Kamall on this matter .
Thirty years before the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the Republic of Latvia declared its loyalty to its fundamental values and principles .
Questions associated with energy security and sustainable energy sources are , however , always on Europe &apos;s political agenda and that of the world .
I still remember very clearly that , during accession negotiations in the second half of the 1990s , Latvia , Lithuania and Slovakia were initially excluded .
This was the noticeable mistrust of farmers and an assumption by many that farmers are somehow enemies of health and the environment .
Only if the people of the Balkans feel that they have equal rights with the other citizens of Europe will we be able to say that we have achieved success .
I wish to emphasise that our efforts must be viewed from a medium- to long @-@ term perspective and not focused merely on the short term .

The fundamental points of this report that I should like to highlight are the fact that it considers that the present system of total allowable catches and quotas does not serve the aims of the reformed CFP , having proven inadequate for both the Community fisheries sector and the conservation of stocks .
Nevertheless , the real impact is unclear with the failure to provide a satisfactory impact assessment on the proposal in its current form .
in writing . - We welcome some of the positive elements of this report , and in particular the recognition of the need to spread the tax burden more fairly , the importance of public expenditure and sound economic governance .
Children must be exempted from the requirements to provide biometric fingerprints for passports .
However , I would like to hear what the Commission , in particular , or perhaps even my colleague Mr Coelho has to say about the question of what we should do when children travel alone , unaccompanied by their parents , as there is no uniform policy as regards which documentation they have to carry with them .
This is therefore an objective which can be used to achieve security for children .
In the resolution you target the questions of document management and a common portal and the Trans @-@ Jai project .
I furthermore assume that Parliament will vote in favour of a real principle of public access in the forthcoming vote on Mr Cashman &apos;s report concerning the Regulation on public access .
Citizens need to clearly see what amendments have been submitted by MEPs during the European decision @-@ making process , in addition to the reports , resolutions and plenary debates .
Public contracts in the fields of defence and security ( debate )
However , I would like to say quite openly that the parliamentary procedure was intolerable .
The same thing will be noted in the field of justice .
The next item is Question Time ( B6 @-@ 0001 / 2009 ) .
Could I specifically ask you , Commissioner - because you have alluded to some of the factors which have resulted in the price fall - given that we were not clear on why prices rose so dramatically , is there a detailed analysis as to why prices have fallen so dramatically ?
In its recent communication on tolerable risk , the Commission proposes to redefine the control system in terms of risk objectives and an acceptable level of error .
Madam President , to answer Mr Ó Neachtain &apos;s question , the Commission has pursued a policy on combating cybercrime for many years , in close cooperation with the Member States and other European Union institutions .
I do intend , in any case , to keep a close eye on this matter .
It is essential that any measures to tackle the crisis are guided by the fundamental freedoms and the principles of non @-@ discrimination and proportionality .
Perhaps you could mention to at least one of your colleagues that we would also like to see something on needle @-@ stick injuries as part of that safety package .
I am also a little dubious about whether it is really necessary to have full regulation of this matter at EU level .
It was therefore a type of grand finale for the old style of chemicals policy and it was certainly a good finale for us to reach agreement so efficiently .
We must also avoid using the interests of industries which manufacture products containing DCM as an argument to support restricted consumer use of dichloromethane .
In 2003 , the ILO Office and its tripartite constituents began working on drawing up updated and comprehensive international labour standards for the fishing sector , aiming to provide appropriate protection for fishers around the globe , in view of the special nature of the sector and its specific living and working conditions .
Agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
All this has come at a time when we have faced a difficult situation at home , with a government reshuffle , and have been subjected to attacks from the opposition , which has been irresponsibly torpedoing the Czech presidency of the EU and holding the country &apos;s foreign commitments to ransom in a domestic political dispute .
Thank you for your attention .
Lastly , the Presidency @-@ in @-@ Office will have to cope with the economic and social crisis by overseeing the implementation of the national recovery plans , by leading the European Union at the G20 summit to be held in London in April .
Nor are we pleased with the fact that no mention is made of such an important sector as that of combating discrimination , and on this point I would like to know what priority you place on adopting the directive on discrimination .
On the questions of energy , energy security , climate change , and the European Union &apos;s role in the process : it should be obvious to everyone that if the European Union &apos;s leadership on the issue of climate change - whatever my own views on the subject - does not gain support from economies and major players such as the USA , the Russian Federation , Brazil , India and China , then this initiative by the European Union is isolated , a voice in the wilderness and , on a global scale , worthless .
This includes one minority we are reluctant to discuss in this Parliament , namely the non @-@ citizens in some states of the European Union .
Mrs. President , I should like to welcome the President @-@ in @-@ Office and to wish him well in his presidency and also to wish his people well .
A solution may , however , be on the point of being found ; in any case the future ought to be guaranteed , in view of the dependence of many states , including my own , on such supplies .
What we need at the moment is leadership , and what I have seen so far has taught me that the sooner we get a full @-@ time president of the Council the better , because it is only coherent European action that will deliver security to Europe , will deliver world influence and deliver economic recovery .
They have a problem with the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon .
( BG ) Thank you , Madam President .
Europe needs to continue facilitating the participation of both men and women in the economy , as well as helping combine family and professional life .
Indeed , these are social and economic problems at a European level that transcend borders .
I will not go into the details , but the authentic version is the English version .
This matter is particularly important for Hungary and for the minorities living inside as well as outside its borders .
I deem it exceptionally good that at long last it takes a correct approach to the problems and rights of traditional national minorities , laying down the principles of self @-@ governance and language use , areas in which the Union has been quite late in creating norms .
It is clear in the report that the Member States have sole authority for defence and national security , which we feel it is important to emphasise .
In addition , vague , controversial concepts like &apos; self @-@ governance &apos; and &apos; cultural autonomy &apos; also have the potential to cause conflict .
in writing . - ( FR ) Entrusting a report such as this to a communist Member is a provocation for the hundreds of millions of victims of communism .
Let us make sure that it is respected !
Furthermore , I am convinced that it is essential to define and enforce global minimum standards of employment and health and safety conditions for seafarers working at sea or on board seagoing ships .
This was not because we have a problem with transparency .
In order to achieve a sustainable ceasefire , we have to look for a sensible compromise entailing an end to rocket launches and reopening of the crossings .
We are very hopeful about the statement made yesterday to the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations by the Secretary of State @-@ designate , Hillary Clinton , as regards offering pragmatic , dialogue @-@ based and effective diplomacy .
A cease @-@ fire is what we want !
It is in fact the deadlock of your essentially humanitarian policy to alleviate the damage caused by the military occupation and the war that is the biggest failure .
A political resolution is the only way to re @-@ establish peace and reconciliation in the area .
The answer is that given by Yasser Arafat , in May 1989 , when he declared his freedom @-@ destroying and deadly charter null and void .
Even in such extreme circumstances , this is a balanced resolution , a resolution that can be supported by the right , a resolution which is not just a pamphlet or a political victory for the left .
Our shame is at the inability of everyone - our countries , the European Union and the international community - to firstly prevent and secondly end the criminal aggression which we condemn .
There are limits on our power to achieve something .
Both parties see only their own interest - that is national egotism .
There is a lot for us to do in building peace within Europe , too .
To give you an idea , gas from storage was used and sold to neighbouring countries and even to members of the Energy Community , alternative fuels were used for electricity production , gas production was increased - including from Algerian , Norwegian and other Russian sources - extra deliveries of gas were made to neighbouring countries .
If we want this , I do ask that we develop a common strategy on it by May - our last sitting .
Even then , it was clear that we were not entirely sure if we could help each other as EU countries in the event of problems in certain countries , as is currently the case in Bulgaria , Slovakia and a number of other countries .
It was already foreseeable , once we were unable to strike back appropriately against Russia for its aggression against Georgia , that Ukraine would be the next target .
Firstly we must reduce dependency on gas , more and more of which will have to be imported .
Madam President , this crisis highlights the importance of making the EU more energy @-@ independent , but , while we are discussing energy supply , we must not forget the fundamental importance of also controlling energy demand .
But , after that , an analysis should take place , and measures should also be taken .
It is very difficult for us to discuss the topic of the gas crisis given that the Council , EP and European Commission ended up with their hands tied at the end of it .
Achieving robust provisions on human rights in the new PCA currently being negotiated is also one of the EU priorities as set out in the negotiation directive which was approved by the Council last year .
And Mrs Ţicău &apos;s question ?
We have been establishing good working relations with IGAD , which supports the Horn of Africa initiative and which plays a key role in its implementation .
The EU will not accept the trampling underfoot of fundamental human rights , the murder or imprisonment of journalists and critics of the regime , while the population is oppressed and starving .
We plan to launch the Eastern Partnership at summit level in Prague in May and the decision of the day was also selected just when this six @-@ month period ends and we can make an evaluation .
For its part , Belarus needs to permit entry to European delegations , too , to enable debates with opposition members .
An expensive visa and strict regulations do not punish the regime , but the population .
We are not yet at the point of having one general agreement .
Just last month , a group boasting over a thousand members was created on the networking site Facebook which openly glorified the genocide in Srebrenica .
I believe that all countries of the Western Balkans will support the recognition of this day .
But I am concerned at reports that , as Neil Parish has told us , these rules are not being similarly observed in other parts of the EU , particularly in some of the southern Mediterranean Member States and in some of the new East European accession states and particularly , again as Neil Parish stressed , where the transport of horses for slaughter is concerned .
What do you in the Commission do with these reports from the Member States ?
I have a concern that we ignore the welfare of domestic pets , because I have seen examples of people who think that they know how to look after animals doing very badly on that front and yet , very often , these are the same people who insist on particular rules for farming and for economic activity .
These need to have proper ventilation , temperature control , a drinking water system and a satellite navigation system .
This is unnecessary .
The Mediterranean diet has helped Italians break the record for longevity in Europe and Italy leads the ranking for best body mass index , which is the relationship between height and weight .
Since I was unable to take part in yesterday &apos;s reception owing to the visit by the President of the Council , Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek , I wish to say the following to Mr Rocard . Mr Rocard , I should like to express my friendship and my deep respect for you , and to wish you happiness and success in all your future plans .
Written explanations of vote
In the absence of a report from the European Commission , our committee conducted its own survey amongst national parliaments and equality organisations .
It does not recognise that it was the Israeli army that broke the truce of 4 November with its land incursion and various aerial attacks , but rather lays the blame on Hamas for the breakdown of the cease @-@ fire .
in writing . - ( SV ) Since it is my firm belief that the European Parliament should not involve itself in foreign policy , I have voted against the resolution in its entirety .
It turned Srebrenica into an operating base against the Serbian environment , whilst it was inevitable that it would eventually be swallowed up by that self @-@ same environment .
We defend the Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi and oppose the recent actions of the authorities and the government campaign , intended to turn public opinion against Shirin Ebadi .
Mr President , Commissioner , the time has fortunately passed when the only known way to topple a government in West Africa was by means of a military coup .
The latest presidential elections proved once again that a non @-@ Kikuyu cannot become President , not even if the majority of voters vote for him .
It is possible to regulate the press without endangering freedom of speech and the freedom of the press .
I have submitted a question to the Council and to the Commission and I hope that measures to harmonise these cards will be adopted as soon as possible .
These are terrible situations caused by the crisis which is devastating us , the consequences of which can be seen in human faces and people &apos;s lives .
( DE ) Madam President , the meat scandal in Ireland has made waves throughout Europe , including Austria where , as a bizarre consequence of the scandal , Irish meat was sold as Tyrolean bacon .
I am the rapporteur on the free trade agreement with ASEAN , and have to say that the negotiating basis is creating an institutional road block .
I also believe that it accounts for a relatively small part of the growth potential , particularly , perhaps , here in Europe .
Small and medium @-@ sized enterprises play a huge part in this .
This would not simply be a consequence of the economic and financial crisis .
The import of cheap textiles from China to Europe is a problem which has grown recently as a result of the gradual liberalisation in world trade .
We basically know what must be done .
The report also emphasises the special significance attaching to local initiatives in the quest for a successful climate and energy policy .
However , the Member States have differing opinions on the question of whether nuclear energy has a role to play in reducing CO2 emissions .
As far as the Economic Recovery Plan is concerned , I must say that I am really annoyed with the Commission .
It has ratified the Energy Charter Treaty and , therefore , plays by transparent rules .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would very much like to thank Mrs Laperrouze and Mr Piebalgs for all the documents they have presented .
How is this consistent with EU Member State solidarity , the common energy policy and energy security ?
The inclusion by the Commission of the electricity interconnection between Ireland and the UK as a priority area for funding under the European economic recovery package is a very welcome development in this regard .
European research has brought about results and it is now both national and regional policy to put these results into practice .
The significance of the initiative that was initially linked to MOL lies in the fact that the states involved will find it easier to assist one another rapidly in the event of disruptions to supply .
There is a dual perception of wilderness in European culture .
The proposal to create a system for mapping Europe &apos;s wilderness would help identify biodiversity and unspoilt areas which will require more attention and a significant effort on the part of Member States in order to protect them .
May I first of all sincerely thank all fellow Members for their help with my own @-@ initiative report .
During my many speeches in the House , I have constantly emphasised that mothers and fathers who freely choose to bring up their children or to care for elderly or dependent family members must not suffer discrimination .
This is the convention of October 2007 , the benchmark representing the most innovative and up @-@ to @-@ date act on child protection .
However , the protection also has to involve the children themselves .
Indeed , the telecom legislation review which we are debating at the moment in the European Parliament , along with the Council and Commission , offers a good opportunity to improve the legislation .
We had a recent case in Ireland which highlighted this .
I will conclude , Madam President , by saying that clearly a significant effort is needed at a cultural and political level , and this effort must be made by families , schools and the media .
The Commission will support and accompany this process by calling regular meetings of experts from the Member States during the transposition phase to discuss any issues that might arise .
There is thus no guarantee that payment will be made .
The real fight is against rogue exploitative employers , and what we need at this time is an agenda that is pro @-@ worker , not anti @-@ immigrant .
This is not worthy of the European Union .
With this in mind , I would like to stress the need to establish a legislative framework which will allow us to define more clearly the sanctions to be imposed on employers of third @-@ country immigrants staying illegally in the European Union , considering that illegal work is an alarming problem at European level and exploitation of the immigrant labour force is a reality .
I am thinking of the temporary residence permit for minors who have been exploited .
( CS ) Mr President , I am pleased to support the report on pre @-@ commercial procurement as it greatly minimises the risk of investing in innovation .
I cannot vote in favour of an ideology which wants to entrust children and adults to the state from the cradle to the grave .
in writing . - ( SK ) I voted in favour of scientific and technical cooperation between the European Community and Russia because it is necessary to build firm , stable and genuinely neighbourly relations with the Russian Federation .
We European citizens have a moral obligation to ensure that future generations can benefit from the protected wilderness areas in Europe .
I agree with the rapporteur when he emphasises the need to educate customers on how to approach innovation in public contracts , since the profession is highly skilled and needs well @-@ trained staff .
It must be decided at EU level .
This requires national public health services that are free or mainly free , and quality , free , public education for all .
I therefore voted in favour of this report .
Child pornography is a delicate subject which should always be a main focus for European and national authorities .
We will face complicated questions requiring coordination of the Member States &apos; action to arrive at a coherent European Union response .
For this reason , I believe we can make a greater contribution to the security of the world by closing Guantánamo , by supporting Barack Obama and by playing an active role if the US Administration asks us to do so and if we can work with the government to put in place a process for accepting these people , than if we were to preach a false concept of security which , Mr Nassauer , could only be implemented if the police and the secret service were to do their job .
Given the freedom of movement we enjoy in Europe , especially the border @-@ free Europe of the Schengen zone , Member States &apos; decisions to allow Guantánamo Bay inmates to settle in their country has security implications not only for that Member State , but also for its neighbours .
I also beg to differ with those fellow Members who believe that we should already make pledges on the basis of the assumption that the European Union is morally obliged to do so , because some countries could possibly have been involved in the transport of inmates to Guantánamo .
These are not refugees .
I can , however , assure my fellow Member , who is no longer present , that Portugal and the Socialist Government of Portugal do not feel guilty .
I will also say here that we will no doubt use our visit to Washington with Mr Langer , the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Interior , to raise all of the issues relating to and consequent upon the closure of Guantánamo with our US colleagues .
I would like , in any case , to thank Parliament for having opened this debate .
I would call on Italy to be open and transparent about the treatment of immigrants on Lampedusa .
Maroni exposed this .
However , I would like to underline my concern , which is also related both to the crisis situation in which we are living today , as we all know , and to the fact that we are in election year , which may , to a great extent , contribute to some cooling of interest and loss of enthusiasm in this area .
What led the Commissioner to extend this contract ?
So this has been promised at least .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Yes , I can definitely say that this is the Commission &apos;s approach .
You talk about the needs of an ageing population .
The main tools available to the Union in this area are funding programmes , particularly the Lifelong Learning Programme 2007 @-@ 2013 .
Such communities are right in thinking , for instance , that autonomy , which has brought prosperity and development to the minorities of the South Tyrol in Italy , would also bring them a desirable solution .
However , the same is not true - and please do not take this personally , Commissioner - in the northern part of the Basque Country , which is attached to the French state , whose President stated to the United Nations Assembly that to deny respect for national identities and languages is to sow the seeds of humiliation and that , without that respect , there will not be peace in the world .
There is no problem , however , because all European Union Member States are also members of the Council of Europe , an organisation which is well @-@ equipped and well @-@ experienced to address that issue .
We have examined specific cases in the Committee on Petitions .
Therefore , the position of the Latvian authorities with regard to the possibility of granting voting rights to non @-@ citizens is firm and unchanged : the right to vote is an integral part of citizenship .
At this point , I would like once again to thank our Chairman and my good friend , Mr Sacconi , who always presided in an excellent and fair manner .
This means that we shall obviously be expecting more from the rapidly developing economies than from the others .
We have the opportunity now , so let us use it .
However , the full success of the initiative will be determined by the involvement of the economies of all the developing countries , such as China and India .
It is high time for us to prepare necessary measures within an EU context .
That requires political courage on the part of the Council , the Commission and members of this Parliament , but it is a necessary condition , essential if the planet is to take up this challenge .
This is shown very clearly in the report along with many opportunities for new technologies and economic development .
Around 10 % of global greenhouse gases are produced in agriculture , most of which , however , are gases of natural origin , such as methane .
Because we will reduce our dependency on imported energy , because we will reduce our consumption of non @-@ renewable natural resources , because we will create new jobs - and do not forget that the various plans within Europe for responding to the financial and economic crisis will create new employment opportunities right in the area of &apos; green jobs &apos; and around new environmental technologies for renewable energy sources and energy saving - and at the same time we shall reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
in writing . - ( PL ) In taking the floor during this debate on climate protection policy up to 2050 , I would like to draw your attention to the following points .
Unfortunately , due to Israel &apos;s celebrations marking 60 years as a nation , the agreed appointment could not be kept .
It is true that these efforts should be deployed as soon as possible in order for our people to regain hope and trust , but we wonder how long Israel will be given a free hand to destroy the assets and infrastructure of Arab people .
( PL ) Madam President , the European economy is the largest importer of fossil fuels .
The question of illicit migration ought to be a national prerogative and the question of sanctions against employers of illicit entrants ought certainly to be reserved to the Member States .
We support in particular the aim of ambitious medium and long @-@ term emission reduction targets , the promotion of renewable energy and increased energy efficiency , and the call for a sustainable approach to forestry , rainforests and deforestation .
Today &apos;s report from Mr Florenz is based on scientific principles and maps out the challenges that face our society in various fields like transport , land @-@ use , energy and waste management . The current economic crisis should not be used as an excuse to row back on our climate commitments .
This directive sends a double signal : one with regard to fraudulent employers who will no longer be able to abuse the situation with impunity , and the other with regard to potential illegal immigrants who will be discouraged by stricter conditions of access to legal employment .
in writing . - I support this resolution which welcomes President Obama &apos;s closure of the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay and his other important and related executive orders ; Recalls that the United States must bear the primary responsibility for the closure of these facilities including the future of its inmates ; However , calls on EU Member States , in the spirit of providing fair and humane treatment for all and reinforcing international law , to respond positively to any request from the United States to aid the resettlement of Guantánamo Bay inmates within the European Union .
It also means continuing to see Kosovo within the wider framework set for the Western Balkans at the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003 .
The result is a text that is well @-@ balanced and to the point , while at the same time managing to deal with all of the important problems .
We should , first of all , rejoice at the fact that the first year of Kosovo &apos;s independence turned out quite well in the end , and better than many had feared .
The independence of a state is not real as long as the United Nations Security Council does not accept it .
Certainly , one day we should bring Kosovo closer to the stabilisation and association process , but still a lot of work remains to be done , and it is no secret that on certain issues , unity in the Council will be difficult to attain .
That represents 6 % of all the jobs in the European Union .
I agree with you , however , that we should make an effort ahead of the Competition Council next spring to maximise coordination , at least on principles , for example linking scrapping schemes to specific emissions targets .
I will give you an example from Germany , my home country , of how not to do it . In Germany , if the CEO of Deutsche Bank , Josef Ackermann , decides to scrap his nine year @-@ old third , fourth or fifth car and buy a new Porsche Cayenne , he will receive EUR 4 000 .
Dramatic events , then , require harmonised action .
It has now been established that the Government was appropriating money from thousands of car owners which was not due .
In December 2008 , the Council agreed guidelines for the implementation of the Lead State concept in relation to consular cooperation .
The problem is in the very wording , in the fundamentals of Article 20 itself .
The Member States should do all that they can to ensure that it is properly implemented , and guarantee equal treatment and care to all EU citizens .
Can the Council inspire the European Technology Institute in Budapest to address itself to the problem of the energy efficiency of buildings ?
In November 1999 , I took the floor in this very Chamber following the storm which had raged in south @-@ west France , to call for European solidarity when wide @-@ scale natural disasters lay waste to our countries .
The objectives of the operations that would receive subsidies include the restoration of infrastructure to working order , the repair of power and water supply equipment and the clean @-@ up of affected areas .
Incidents like those in Belgium in 1999 , and in Ireland last year , have demonstrated once again that even small amounts of PCBs can cause severe contamination of the feed and food chain .
on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner , at least this was discovered , in the Irish case , by means of inspections .
I , personally , at least , would like this to happen and for the surplus foodstuffs in question not to be destroyed .
However , the level of detail or specificity of internal traceability chosen by the food business operator determines the final economic loss to be borne by food business operators in the case of recall .
Everything that is on the label , such as energy , protein , and suchlike , is valuable information .
Mr President , in the aftermath of the dioxin contamination in the Republic of Ireland which visited such losses on innocent producers and processors in Northern Ireland , we discussed new measures on the labelling of feedstuffs .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to start by thanking our rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , as he has succeeded in producing a genuinely workable compromise at first reading .
This policy meets the actual needs of Member States wishing to promote their agricultural production , both among the Community &apos;s consumers and among those in third countries .
I feel that these amendments are appropriate and I hope that this initiative will be supported by as many MEPs as possible .
I repeat once again : we have a collective responsibility .
For many years , we have treated China as though it were some sort of small child that needed to be chided and argued about , as though we were some superior institution .
As for asylum seekers whose application is or has to be refused , this concept , the result of a generous but narrow notion of asylum , cannot give rise to any less humanity in the reception and treatment of people who will always be vulnerable by virtue of their condition .
It has opened up new markets and broken down barriers to trade .
I have been arguing in favour of the opposite for 30 years , both within and outside this Parliament .
I do not welcome Mrs Wortmann @-@ Kool &apos;s proposal on Trade and Economic Relations with China , since I disagree with various points made in the report .
Hundreds of defenceless people have died in the conflict zone since the middle of January .
They pursue autonomy and organise protests against the central dictatorship .
( LT ) There are two sides to these tragic events on the Burma @-@ Thailand border .
One aspect of human rights is that convicted murderers be brought to justice , and so I hope that this motion for a resolution receives strong support .
These , the worst bushfires in Australia &apos;s history , have claimed many lives in horrible circumstances .
As everybody knows , we strongly encourage intra @-@ Palestinian reconciliation behind President Abbas and all the efforts by Egypt and the Arab League in that direction .
At that point , I may need to come back to discuss this with you .
Well , perhaps , but let us first acknowledge that the policy failures , the dashed hopes and the creeping extremism of the past seven years have taken place under the Quartet &apos;s watch .
The US and Israel do the bombing while Europe finances reconstruction .
Democracy , peace and respect for human rights are fundamental values for the European Union which has the role and obligation to defend and promote them , both inside the EU and in its relations with other states too .
We also need to consider what the security and defence @-@ related ambitions of the European Union actually are .
And so I think that what we are doing , in having military and civilian cooperation at the strategic planning level , is very important .
The European security and defence policy has only been in existence for around ten years , we should remember , and the document on the security strategy was only produced in 2003 .
High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy . - ( ES ) Mr President , as quickly as possible and given that the contributions of the various speakers have , in general terms , been along the same lines , allow me to mention to the House three or four issues that come to mind having heard the speeches .
( ES ) Commissioner , Mr Solana , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank the three rapporteurs for their work .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are completely inconsistent .
There is now an urgent need to reform the organisation and we have undertaken to advance this reform , so that the UN can respond more effectively to its important task .
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , let me just make a few remarks , and one in particular : I think this debate has shown that there is a growing acceptance of the approach Europe follows in crisis management and conflict prevention .
The increasing need for the EU to operate more efficiently and promptly , and events demanding intellectual answers with increasing urgency , call for a review of the organisational and decision @-@ making mechanisms for governing our foreign policy , and for the provision of suitable structural answers .
The current rotating presidency gives priority to strengthening this partnership .
For this reason , my political group will vote against the amendments tabled by the far left ; we believe that they are excessively controversial and not very constructive .
Clearly , this can only be achieved with appropriate support and funding .
This is something we have all worked towards , and so we give our wholehearted support not only to the fact that the regional programmes should continue but also , as the Commissioner knows , that Parliament attaches great importance to these programmes , which have arguably produced better results .
( PL ) Mr President , tomorrow Vaclav Klaus , President of the Czech Republic , will visit the European Parliament .
Just in case they have also somehow forgotten , the Babeş @-@ Bolyai University in Cluj @-@ Napoca has three sections offering instruction in Romanian , Hungarian and German respectively , plus the flourishing development of Jewish studies at the institution , as well as special places for Roma .
I was very pleased to read Mr Szymański &apos;s comments and to see that he considers that the ENPI regulation is adequate and valid for the purpose of cooperation with our neighbouring countries .
I see the European Union as a family of people who communicate with each other .
Of course - as I always say as a mother of the neighbourhood policy - I would love to have more .
On these kinds of activities , we agree with you on the need to have legislation to cover measures which promote EU concerns in DCI countries .
I like texts and I take words seriously , which is the essence of Europe - its humanism , taking texts seriously and taking language seriously .
It would be instrumental in achieving the movement of knowledge in the European Union , increasing the prestige and authority of European research centres at a world level and increasing employment , and will contribute in the search for adequate solutions to new environmental challenges .
Time is the crucial question here , so we are talking about whether we can speed up and simplify how we are building the research infrastructure together .
The Committee on Development then started drafting a report .
In the case of restructuring enterprises , I would call on European funds to be made available and for assistance to be provided to workers , not only enterprises .
We call on the Commission to present the conclusions of the thematic conferences .
The significance of energy efficiency lies in its ability to achieve perceptible results faster than by any other means .
In addition , within the scientific community there is a perception that the Directorate @-@ General appears to have opted to prioritise basic research without making room for research focused on public policies .
During these difficult economic times , different means need to be used to boost the economy and a reduced tax may be an important method of achieving this .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , it is hard to believe that we are sitting here today discussing minor changes to the rules on value added tax when EU countries are facing the worst financial and economic crisis since the Great Depression .
Stable public finances during the current period of economic upheaval will allow the relevant governments to deal with the structural deficits in the current period .
This coincidence gives us cause to hope for significant changes .
Welcome
I firmly believe that the citizens of the various Member States want freedom , democracy and economic prosperity .
Madam President , I rise to explain the fact that I was one of only five Members of this House who voted against this resolution .
It will be necessary to ensure that we are not , at Community level , doing what is best left to Member States .
We have adopted further measures of a procedural nature .
It also calls on the Commission to start infringement procedures against Member States that fail to implement this legislation and make sure that all information and consultation directives are coherent and where necessary propose a revision .
The need for information campaigns in schools and platforming from there into all areas of life is crucial .
We are employing energy ever more rationally .
The existing moratorium on whaling has already produced good results in terms of increasing cetacean populations , although many key countries have not ratified it , meaning that whaling still goes on .
I support this legislation because it will create a fairer system for legitimate European workers .
in writing . - The European Parliamentary Labour Party voted in favour of this report .
Nevertheless , I welcome the Council &apos;s recent expression of support for Taiwan &apos;s meaningful participation in international organisations .
It is also replete with positive references to the Treaty of Lisbon , which we have strenuously opposed .
It refers to the Treaty of Lisbon , which we have strenuously opposed , and also voices support for a permanent EU operational headquarters , backing for an EU &apos; White Book &apos; on European defence , and unequivocal praise of the European Defence Agency .
On this point , I agree with my fellow Member in believing that sectoral and general budget support under the ENPI should be made available only to governments which are able to implement it in a transparent , effective and accountable manner and where it constitutes a real incentive ; for this very reason , however , I cannot agree to a review of the ENPI as set out in his report .
In both cases , the deadline for alternative joint motions for resolutions is this evening , which means that it is technically impossible to vote on these texts tomorrow .
( RO ) Following the parliamentary elections in Romania , the political parties representing the opposition are in a difficult situation at the moment .
He has issued a decision under which schools where teaching takes place in ethnic minority languages may henceforth use only history text books that are literal translations of the Slovak ones .
After 1990 , it was reorganised and , similarly to other historical churches , it is trying to this day to recover its confiscated immovable property .
As for the pilot projects and preparatory actions , I am sure we will be able to build on last year &apos;s excellent cooperation between institutions .
We must not forget that the fight against terrorism is still , regrettably , a priority for the European Union .
We really need to get the magnifying glass out and take a close look at what projects we can implement in this period .
This is the only way to offer more effective protection than what nation states can provide to SMEs that are in difficulty because of the crisis .
Employees &apos; rights are core rights for a social Europe .
To sum up , when reading this draft regulation it appears that the emphasis placed on &apos; small enterprises &apos; is above all political window @-@ dressing aimed at making acceptable a rehash of the sadly famous &apos; country of origin &apos; principle .
The second thing that I believe we must demonstrate is that we are helping SMEs in what is currently the most critical factor , namely access to and availability of credit .
This could be accomplished , on the one hand , by reducing administrative burdens , and on the other hand , through activities involving VAT , such as a one @-@ stop shop system or a reduced VAT rate .
The fourth thing I want to say is that the argument on the part of left @-@ wing Members - none of whom stayed for the debate earlier on - that the proposal should be rejected does not take account of the substance of the report - Mr Medina Ortega is absolutely right about this .
Frontex really needs to be able to undertake this training task .
I think that this is discrimination against women and children and I would like to address this issue today , following Women &apos;s Day .
In recent decades , we have learned that there is no dynamic economic development that could automatically offer mobility , using the existing systems of redistribution , to those at the lowest social stratum .
The European Court of Auditors ( ECA ) and the European Parliament have been calling for effective , efficient control of the budgetary resources for years , and numerous attempts and suggestions have been made by the ECA , in particular , seeking to ensure that the Commission uses these resources appropriately and economically .
They are also a fundamental element in what is a special feature of sporting life in Finland , in which voluntary work supported by society is also a basic support for high @-@ level sports .
I do not know what the Commission has achieved or what it hopes to achieve , but it seems to me quite difficult to achieve anything because of the huge difficulties involved in this form of intergovernmental cooperation .
Firstly , massive investment is needed to produce and exploit the available oil : USD 350 billion per annum is the figure always quoted in this connection .
( The sitting was opened at 9.05 a.m. )
Road safety saves lives , as Commissioner Verheugen commented , and is so important to the well @-@ being of many families in the European Union .
I must say , however , and I think this is extremely important , that I did not feel pressurised by anyone , nor did I feel under political pressure .
That is the objective of the Commission proposal .
Al Gore has left a clear mark .
Firstly , the Commission has not only sought to simplify and ensure better implementation , it has also greatly increased the scope in certain areas .
While industrial activity has a fundamental role to play in maintaining and increasing economic well @-@ being , we must not lose sight of the impact it has on the environment .
What can you say about the statement by the Council that outsiders should not be given documents relating to legal advice in connection with legislative procedure ?
In the European Union , however , the reality when it comes to transparency issues is that the task we face is like trying to clear an avalanche with a shovel .
Mr Cashman is saying it is , and according to the wide definition in the Regulation , it could very well be so - as could the other scribbles I have here .
For the same reason as Mr Sacconi , but with a different conclusion , I see absolutely no reason to postpone .
If that is the case , my group requests that we delay the vote on the Krahmer report until tomorrow , so that we can investigate the implications of the application of the recast procedure to that vote .
The truth is that we are bringing in regulations in Europe , and restricting production in Europe , whilst allowing imports into the European Union that are not produced to the same standards as they are in Europe .
Therefore we are going to take your money anyway through your taxpayers &apos; money to keep our companies alive &apos; .
This own @-@ initiative report on the future of the management of the EU &apos;s external borders is a reasonable one , and it is tinged with a degree of realism in that it proposes , as a first stage in re @-@ examining border management in the EU , a critical , in @-@ depth analysis of the operation and effectiveness of the existing systems and how they interact .
Nobody points out , though , that it is the abuse of the procedure for illegitimate purposes that slows down the assessment of genuine asylum applications .
I support this report which urges Member States to take specific measures to encourage and promote women to further their careers where they are under represented .
The impasse in environmental protection is being included in the anti @-@ monopoly , anti @-@ imperialist fight by the workers against the economic sovereignty of the monopolies and their political power and against the EU and the parties which support the European one @-@ way street .
In point 5 of the motion for a resolution , in fact , mention is made of a complete adaptation in view of Croatia &apos;s accession to the European Union .
Applying harmonised production and marketing standards to both small producers and agro @-@ industry is unacceptable .
Although 99 % of the EU &apos;s businesses are SMEs ( 23 million ) - responsible for the creation of 80 % of the new jobs in the EU in recent years - the majority of the rules normally created are aimed at the 41 000 large European companies .
At the same time , to be fair , I would like to praise the firm political will shown by the French Presidency to bring such an important topic to a conclusion .
I am aware , let us say , but I cannot fail to point out that something is missing from this set of rules , owing to the fact that many ships that travel indiscriminately between rivers and the sea are not covered in this way and , certainly , this is a point that should be covered somehow .
You , the Commission , with your fine European Maritime Safety Agency , must now ensure that the Member States also implement and apply this .
I also think that , if we fail in this , it will affect our food chain and our lives , and we will end up paying a high price for it .
There is no doubt that the Commission will ensure this commitment is respected and upheld and we will do so with the technical support of the Agency .
That is , we want to establish a framework , to lay down ground rules that Member States must observe if they wish to internalise external costs .
No European charges are to be imposed .
I should also like to take this opportunity to request support for my Amendment 76 .
We have had negative experience reforming the common agricultural policy , and this is likely to repeat itself now .
He seems not to understand that this is optional on Member States .
Mr President , I wish to make a couple of comments .
Do you wish to pose your supplementary question Mrs Doyle ?
However , we still have a problem with people from disadvantaged backgrounds and elderly people using and accessing the Internet and new technologies .
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to answer them together .
At a meeting of the European Council in Barcelona in 2002 , the Member States adopted ambitious aims which were to be fulfilled by 2010 .
However , I would also like to thank Commissioner Špidla , who has , in fact , made it clear that the Commission still regards it as important for us to achieve the Barcelona objectives with regard to childcare .
We suggest that the Commission should seriously factor in the public cost of a child when evaluating employment programmes in each country .
We will not move forward through an obsession with the state and with the market .
Indeed , they often sacrifice their own careers , their own chosen path , as it were , in order to try and do this .
The Portuguese Government has been doing everything to find a solution that makes this company viable , but the solution is also dependent on the involvement of the German Federal Government and the state governments of Bavaria and Saxony .
Multi @-@ annual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean ( debate )
It must also consider that the system of fishing for tuna with fixed nets is also a cultural and historical activity that does not damage the environment and provides employment for thousands of people .
As this Parliament certainly knows , a wide range of measures have been taken by the Union and the Member States in the face of the financial crisis .
With the very strong support of the Czech Presidency , whose commitment and complete cooperation with the Commission I welcome , I am convinced there will be progress in four areas that the Commission defined a few days ago in its communication , namely , the financial markets , the real economy , employment and the social dimension , and the global dimension via the G20 .
We have never done enough , but now we have the chance to invest seriously in education .
This means that people &apos;s livelihoods are being destroyed .
We do not have the money .
The Bank is currently increasing its capital by EUR 76 billion and is negotiating with the European Central Bank to make improvements in relation to liquidity .
However , the Commission is not making use of this opportunity and is relying on a rescue package involving outdated concepts such as road building and the car industry .
I rather hope that the Commission will simplify the procedures for the Structural Funds , which must not be done at the expense of controlling the distribution and spending of the funds .
As we often refer to the crisis of 1929 , let us look by way of comparison at the example of Roosevelt &apos;s New Deal , which spent 3.5 % of GDP over seven years .
I therefore support the many calls this morning for greater responsibility and more intensive cooperation .
The downturn is becoming larger than we thought at the start .
The European Union has a responsibility to see if it is possible to allow national and regional authorities flexibility so that better ownership can be taken of EU funds to deal with the unprecedented situation .
I also welcome extending the opportunity of support to investments in energy efficiency and renewable energies in the housing and clean technology sectors .
Before the final vote :
In the last ten years , significant progress has been made in this area and we have all felt the benefits .
It is about time we were honest with ourselves and admitted that .
I believe that the environmental disaster that struck Romania cannot go unheeded .
I share the view that it is crucial to make the European maritime area one of the safest and most exemplary maritime areas in the world .
I have therefore voted in favour of this proposal , not least because the congestion charge was included as an additional external cost for mountainous regions .
Creating an EU @-@ level expert group , including representatives of the Roma , could also help coordinate Member States &apos; Roma strategy and the use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds .
They shift the burden of the crisis on to the workers , who paid for the excessive profits of capital and are now being called upon to pay for the crisis and to save and increase capitalist profit .
We have resisted efforts from the left , whose amendments have aimed to turn a reasonable report into an unaffordable shopping list or an attack on capitalism and the financial system in general .
Approval of the minutes of the previous sitting : see Minutes
I also wish to say to Mr Lax that the problems with SIS II do not affect VIS .
In any case , we shall have a definite date fixed to enable the Council to take the necessary decisions . Once again , I do , of course , undertake to keep Parliament informed .
On a personal basis , I would simply say that I have much sympathy for the hopes and aspirations of ordinary citizens of the former Yugoslavia who would like to be able to travel freely again .
Mr President , I should like to start by conveying my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has contributed to this report .
Blocking these talks sends the very dangerous message that accession does not depend on fulfilling the conditions but on settling bilateral disputes , in which one side , in a position of strength , seeks to force its will upon the other .
As regards Croatia &apos;s imminent EU accession , it is regrettable that border disputes with Slovenia remain outstanding .
Discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities continues .
This progress will be marked , on the one hand , by the removal of Turkish occupying troops and , on the other hand , by taking a constructive stand on all aspects in order to resolve the question .
My position is that as long as the country does not substantially change its behaviour on fundamental issues , the process of its accession to the EU will vanish into the future .
These common positions are regularly extended and updated .
That was all the more reason to come forward with these proposals .
I agree with Mr Mitchell that we need a plan , yes , and we have some plans .
As you know , the Presidency and Parliament &apos;s representatives managed to reach an agreement concerning this proposal and the European Parliament adopted the regulation yesterday .
All those things are important , Commissioner .
( PL ) Madam President , the shortage of healthcare staff is a global phenomenon .
Such &apos; twinning &apos; partnerships - for instance through training and technical assistance - can be efficient ways to promote the principles of good governance in the water sector in ACP countries .
Lastly , there is another very weak point : the document contains no organisational proposal for world water management .
That is not just a slogan but a reality in so many low @-@ income countries .
So the current pace of migration is too slow to attain critical mass migration by 2010 .
Since you are here with us , Commissioner , maybe we can ask ourselves another question .
The LTTE is now in a desperate end game and , typically in such situations , is turning to international apologists to get it off the hook .
The European Union can and must respond to these challenges and the Eastern Partnership is , so to say , our political answer .
Belarus should obviously be invited , but on a very conditional principle , where we should fix the minimum thresholds on fundamental values .
Not only will this help ensure institutional stability , it will also help implement economic reforms .
In December 2008 , the European Commission adopted a proposal , tabled by Poland and Sweden , to strengthen the European Union &apos;s cooperation with six of its eastern neighbours .
I would sincerely ask you , Commissioner , to again do everything you can to analyse the situation once more together with your competent colleagues and , where problems exist , to really lift these restrictions .
These partnerships often function solely as a forum .
We highlight in the report that Europe is Mexico &apos;s second biggest partner after the United States .
Mrs Weber raised the question of inequality .
While we recognise that the situation has improved significantly over the last 10 years , there are still many areas where human rights are still not properly or adequately protected .
I appreciate that this temporary granting of some freedom of the press was for foreign journalists .
- Before the vote :
In fact , no progress could be achieved anyway .
Mr President , I voted in favour of this resolution and report , but I have some concerns .
However , it is precisely for this reason that Member States need to arrive at solutions that suit their own culture and values in order for them to have a democratic basis within the Member States &apos; own populations .
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs , the British Conservative Mr Tannock , representing the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , gained acceptance for his demand for a &apos; temporary ceasefire &apos; .
in writing . - ( SV ) The June List is very positively disposed towards future enlargements of the European Union .
in writing . - ( EL ) The Greek Communist Party voted against the motion for a resolution on the FYROM .
The responsibility for aid is , and should remain , a matter for the Member States .
We call on them to fight corruption more effectively and to consult with civil society and other organisations on internal reconciliation in the state .
The country gained full independence , following a period of temporary occupation by the Japanese , in 1946 , and was ruled as a dictatorship for many years by President Marcos .
Since this is a very sensitive matter requiring very delicate handling , we consider that , before any resolution is passed by this House , every possible chance of success must be given to these efforts .
In the meantime , in Darfur , President al @-@ Bashir is expelling organisations which are trying to resolve this key issue .
Almost every family in Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia , as well as in other former Soviet republics , suffered as a result of the horrific violence perpetrated by the totalitarian , Communist regime .
I think - and , from the Council vote , it is clear - that most Member States think the same way : that the Member States should have the competence to authorise a GMO or not .
Mr President , I have only one question : can minorities count on support from Europe ?
So I would like to bring this problem to your attention , and I hope we will find , together with the European Commission , a convenient way to settle this problem .
The Côte d &apos;Ivoire faces a particular problem owing to the fact that the agreement is currently being negotiated and will be signed in isolation , while the aim in the future is to negotiate a regional agreement .
However , I know from my visit to Port Moresby at the last ACP meeting that there are other Pacific countries that would like to sign a final agreement provided it meets their requirements , which is why , in my case , I am actually in favour of the interim agreement .
We must respond to the current crisis by establishing further partnerships and not by restricting them .
We can , of course , feel pleased today about the way the situation has developed .
I wish to thank the Commissioner for her determination in continuing the negotiations for the Economic Partnership Agreements .
In my view this is a key moment in the development of EPAs .
Here , too , I am satisfied that we have achieved a compromise which I can wholeheartedly support .
My colleague Frédérique Ries , who cannot be with us tonight , wanted to ensure that steps were taken to try and avoid the marketing of counterfeit products , to strengthen product traceability and to tighten up restrictions on the making of false claims about the beneficial effects of these products .
At the same time , it is important that we handle this matter with due caution ; without delaying new discoveries and their implementation , we should nevertheless pay attention to the health risks as well .
The testing of an active agent costs several thousand euros , and this investment can only be recovered if the results , at least for a certain period of time , are not accessible to other applicants .
That is an important detail .
What I believe is lacking in this resolution is any text going into a problem that has been around for a number of years , namely the lease or even purchase by outside states or companies of large areas of agricultural land , with the harvest going to foreign investors and therefore not benefiting the malnourished local population .
I would like this debate to return to the issue of the establishment , or not , of budget support and conditionalities because , like you , I am very unsure about the latter .
These efforts will obviously be made using a combination of multiple instruments .
When we talk about the European Union @-@ India free trade agreement , it is important to take into account the general context and complexity of our strategic relations with India , including the 1994 Cooperation Agreement and the Joint Action Plan , to mention but two of the major initiatives and dialogues that we have established with India .
It is desirable for consumers to be able to access quality products at reasonable prices , and this thanks to an ambitious policy of financial incentives aimed at this type of agricultural production .
This is why we have negotiated an agreement with the Member States and with Parliament for joint communication on Europe .
We are obviously in full agreement with the report .
In this respect , we also insist on the need to preserve linguistic diversity in Europe .
The priority is often drawdown itself rather than an effective investment or an evaluation of available resources .
All the reports underline the need for cohesion policy to respond to new challenges such as demography , energy , climate and globalisation .
In my view , we should scrutinise the statistical data for NUTS3 , and not just NUTS2 .
Therefore , it is logical for us to reject all attempts to renationalise the structural policy .
The gap between lip @-@ service in government strategies and delivery on the ground is widening with every tightening of the fiscal belt .
( BG ) Ladies and gentlemen , the cohesion policy is one of the fundamental components of the European Union .
On a European level these are small figures , but our microcredit enterprise in Dublin and Ireland is hugely significant .
We must also address issues such as better access to public services that aim to improve employability and productivity and thus contribute to more equal opportunities .
The principle of additionality is also important in order to persuade Member States to encourage people to begin micro @-@ enterprises and not sit at home collecting social benefits , something to which Mrs De Vits has also referred .
The successful implementation of the operational programmes depends to a huge extent on how quickly we manage to simplify the procedures and promote the measures intended to consolidate institutional capacity and , not least , on how we identify the specific professional training requirements for the staff working with European funds .
Do not think me rude if I take it away from him as soon as I realise that it is not a point of order on problems relating to the Rules of Procedure .
( PL ) Mr President , the universal nature of European art shows the need to give schools back their roles as the main centres for spreading culture .
I think the work done in this report really highlights the fact that anything we put on our skin goes into our system just as effectively as if we ate it .
- ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to say that I voted in favour of the van Nistelrooij report , but I would also take this opportunity , for the benefit of the few spectators who remain , to say that , if , instead of continuing to go around the European Union and around their constituencies speaking ill of the Union , those Members of this House who today so roundly criticised the European Union and its procedural method were to provide much more objective information , this would undoubtedly create a completely different atmosphere .
In order to consolidate the progress made in these areas , we must also promote human security , not only from an economic and social perspective , but &apos; hard &apos; security too .
In this regard it refers to Europeana , the European digital library , which represents genuine added value in this context .
Nihil novi : nothing new without the common consent .
Instead , I believe that this manoeuvre threatens direct aids for agriculture and will cause serious socio @-@ economic imbalances in rural areas .
That is why I am equally satisfied that an alignment of the minimum rate of taxation applied to rolling tobacco to that applied to cigarettes has been avoided .
I see no reason to throw particular suspicion on people who request asylum on these specific grounds .
It represents an enormous bonus for the EU and we must therefore support programmes for language teaching and school and cultural exchanges within a framework that also extends beyond the EU .
The debate on territorial cohesion is much more than a budget debate or a debate on Community policies ; it is a debate on the guiding principles of one of the founding and fundamental concepts of the idea of Europe as we see it .
I stand here proud to be British and proud to be European , representing a country that does not see itself as an island adrift from Europe but as a country at the centre of Europe - not in Europe &apos;s slipstream but in Europe &apos;s mainstream .
( Applause )
That is exactly the way we have to go , and we the European Socialists and Social Democrats - and I am speaking not only on behalf of the members of my group , but on behalf of Mr Rasmussen , the leader of our Social Democratic movement in Europe - can subscribe to every word of your speech , Prime Minister .
We must bring the banks back to a point where they do the job for which they were invented in Tuscany many centuries ago : financing the real economy .
Whatever the party political lines that people want to adopt on this , this is the truth : we have to deal with the problem of global banking restructuring .
I think this will be a very useful development .
These EIB operations are especially relevant in middle @-@ income countries and infrastructure , financial and commercial sectors .
I believe , in fact , that the existence of banks such as the European Investment Bank or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is particularly justified at a time like the present .
We state quite clearly in this report that we will focus first of all on existing deficits and the long @-@ term outlook , without dealing in detail with the budgetary impact of the Lisbon Reform Treaty .
If we do not stick to them , I think we would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater .
The current long @-@ term budget , which is valid until 2014 , was , in fact , determined in 2005 .
- The debate is closed .
It is calling for any potential restructuring to involve prior discussion with workers and their trade unions .
Our demands have not yet been adequately met by the Commission or by the Council , either from the point of view of support for demand or in terms of external competition with appropriate support for exports .
In the short term , we must provide temporary incentives and financial support , through the European Investment Bank or other means , to ensure the survival and recovery of the sector .
The proposal to use the crisis to carry out a kind of &apos; cleansing &apos; in the automotive industry remains unchanged .
I am genuinely delighted that this will allow a reduction in air transport &apos;s environmental impact , of course , and in its cost to the consumer .
It is no coincidence that , following the regulation submitted and approved on air transport , regulations on maritime transport and bus transport are being discussed .
The subject which we are discussing will actually affect a large number of consumers at European Union level .
I would like first of all to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Baroness Ludford for the energy she has put into and the results she has obtained from the difficult negotiation of this matter .
It is necessary for us to do this , bearing in mind that a number of Member States are already using this method , without the existence of a legislative framework in this area .
I look forward to hearing your opinions on these sensitive issues and would like to thank the rapporteur , Ms Liotard , and the shadow rapporteurs for their valuable work on this important report .
Amendments 62 and 90 , for which the Greens have requested a vote by roll call , are obviously an attempt of this kind .
rapporteur . - ( NL ) Madam President , I would like to express my sincere thanks to my fellow Members for their input into the debate and for the support I have received for various points in my report .
Climate change is an environmental problem on a totally different scale from earlier problems .
A worker dismissed from Saab in Sweden enjoys social standards that are completely different to those of a worker dismissed from General Motors somewhere in Chicago and the governments in these two cases have completely different approaches , as the automatic stabilisers multiply the EUR 400 billion to something substantially higher and give us an undisputed advantage over the US in this regard .
If I have left something out I will add it in the discussion following the speeches of the party leaders .
Barack Obama seems to have decided to accept the helping hand we were offering him by deciding to implement an emissions quota exchange system in the United States .
Therefore I propose extending the time frame of availability for these funds .
That would not be a good thing .
Well , the calculation is simple .
If we manage to do this in this crisis , then the Czech Presidency will have met all our expectations in full , regardless of what happens with the Treaty of Lisbon and the internal situation in the Czech Republic .
However , this also applies to us back home and it is your party that has kept us out of the euro zone for many years .
The suggestion by Russia &apos;s Foreign Minister , Sergei Lavrov , that the Eastern Partnership is a means for the EU to expand its sphere of influence abroad is absurd .
Its responsibility is to provide a concerted , effective and sustained triple response to stimulate demand and the real economy with future investments , to re @-@ establish lending and to promote robust international financial regulation and supervision that provides transparency , stability and appropriate incentives , that eliminates systemic risks and that ensures that we do not go back to square one .
If we assume that more than a thousand billion euros are to be invested up to 2030 in order to build new power stations , then we need to make a start today .
Last but not least , investments relating to energy efficiency do not figure on the list of the investments receiving financing .
This relates both to the cover sheet of the document and to the table of contents , to the opinion page and to the procedure page , the last page of the Committee on International Trade .
It is essentially self @-@ perpetuating .
Written explanations of vote
Furthermore , novel foods must not endanger or mislead consumers .
However , I do not think the agreement in question is on the right lines , since it does not help the countries concerned to create a self @-@ sufficient economy able to sustain itself without depending on external aid .
an independent monitoring mechanism will be established within the CARIFORUM States , equipped with the necessary resources to undertake the analysis required to determine the extent to which the EPA is achieving its objectives ;
In order to produce this joint agenda , the Council and the Commission should in the coming months step up their contacts with the new government in Washington .
I can assure you that the Czech Presidency is committed to ensuring that it remains at the heart of our wider external strategy and will play a determining role in addressing the many challenges and problems which confront us globally today .
Therefore , the strengthening of the political European Union is essential for future cooperation with the United States .
The EU should adapt its behaviour accordingly .
Only with an EU capable of sharing the burden and assuming its global responsibilities , an EU which is not just the sum of its parts , will we be taken seriously in Washington , be able to influence the policies of the Obama Administration and be in a position to enable the genuine transatlantic partnership that the world still needs .

Mr Verheugen has already had a meeting with his new US counterpart , Mr Froman , on 23 March 2009 .
The political system is also far from satisfactory , especially concerning the continued repression of political parties other than the governing party , and also the repression of various religious groups .
Suspension of the agreements in the case of an established , continuous and serious breach of the human rights clause is therefore possible .
I therefore say to you that , under these circumstances , agreement on this Interim Agreement is not possible .
We therefore have to engage with the country in a constructive , continuous and strategic manner .
To conclude , in order to strengthen these dialogues , ladies and gentlemen , next week Parliament will adopt a resolution on Belarus , and the Commission will genuinely pay very close attention to your recommendations .
I would like to remind you that for Russian citizens the Schengen visa is half this price .
It was subsequently agreed that 2009 be designated as the 20th anniversary of democratic change in Central and Eastern Europe .
The European Union has an important task , namely , to call upon these countries to rectify this unacceptable situation .
We will not be signing any declaration of repentance for the imperialists .
In the words of the Hungarian poet Attila József , &apos; it is a great enough struggle to admit the past &apos; .
If the European Commission is willing to assist in this process , then I have already mentioned the next stages , which would involve completing studies of various methods and mechanisms of Member States in this area and submitting the awaited report next year .
Let me conclude with a general comment .
I firmly believe that it is the Member States that should decide what constitutes a crime and what , if any , consequences it may have .
This is why I am focusing my attention on the need for a separate analysis of the language used on the Internet and its influence on the personal development of the child .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I welcome the statement by the EU Sports Ministers at their meeting last November in Biarritz .
I look forward to maintaining this approach .
I should therefore like to hear Commissioner Figel &apos; tell us that the Commission is still prepared to set up a scrapping fund .
I also believe that Parliament is adding a new important element which the Commission &apos;s proposal has omitted .
The horizontal approach is not only an important aspect on the basis of the arguments which I expounded earlier ; the Commissioner personally also addressed the question of the legal basis .
It would seem fitting that the new aid programme for the poorest would also serve as an outlet for European Community produce .
That is not the point today .
The economic crisis threatens to increase the size of that group .
We have here a situation which proves that there are also large areas of poverty and want inside the European Union .
One last point : I very much welcome the fact that we have agreed that we do not want a claims industry based on the American model with a turnover of USD 240 billion a year from which ultimately only lawyers profit and the consumers get absolutely nothing .
Although they are based on my report , they are not impartial .
Just how important this is can be seen from the fact that cheap labour can be found on building sites all over Europe and it even jeopardises safety , as shown by the example of the Finnish nuclear plant , where safety standards were not met by subcontractors .
But soon he will be gone , looking at the hopeless nature of the one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all regulation that cripples EU businesses , and doubtless he will think that there is no lifeline that he can throw .
The views that are put forward in this committee simply to get agricultural products on the market are astounding .
The prerequisites for comparisons between the Member States simply do not exist for numerous different reasons .
I have been approached by many expats , all of whom did everything they could to establish a proper , legal and sustainable life in Spain .
Internet use and development are without doubt a source of important progress , especially where freedom of expression and democracy are concerned .
It is there that most long @-@ lasting exchange programmes and joint projects between areas of different traditions , customs and achievements arise .
This sector can contribute to the development of disadvantaged regions through grants for cultural cooperation projects in the fields of art and culture .
Written declarations ( submission ) : see Minutes
The agreement that we are negotiating should , of course , also be based on respect for human rights and democracy , and we believe this should be an essential component .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing our recommendations to the Council for the new agreement with Russia .
The broad agreement ought to include an energy security strategy , based on ratification of the Energy Charter .
In the European tradition , power should be supervised by democratic institutions .
The new agreement is one way to do this .
Continuing disputes with gas suppliers and the politicisation of energy resources do not increase trust .
Any measures will have to be applied in full compliance with the International Law of the Sea .
( DA ) Mr President , as a Dane involved in tabling this motion for a resolution together with Mrs Wallis in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , I am not necessarily very popular .
This shows that the fight against discrimination in everyday life is a constant priority for most of us , even during a serious economic crisis .
There is no reasonable explanation for the fact that the law against discrimination offers protection beyond the workplace to a black homosexual on grounds of skin colour , but not of sexual orientation .
Anyone valuing freedom of choice for parents will not allow this freedom to be curtailed .
Indeed , if it did , it would be corrected by the Council of Ministers .
If this is true , it is true ; therefore anyone who has a religious faith is a person , as the fact that he or she is a person comes before the fact that they have a religious faith .
Relations must be made clear so as to avoid infringing anyone &apos;s rights , including the rights of those who belong to the churches sanctioned by legal regulations .
It also states that Member States should not only express the wish to overcome discrimination , but also have a duty to do so .
In future , project applicants will be able to use flat rates in their calculations and also be able to apply for lump sums up to EUR 50 000 for each measure .
All the instruments set in motion aim to accomplish this purpose and obtain faster results .
Mr President , the world economic downturn is hitting each of our countries and each of our regions .
In my opinion , this represents an effective , albeit as yet insufficient , contribution to dealing with the current crisis .
Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs .
2 . Simplifying procedures concerning eligibility of expenditure retroactively as far back as 1 August 2006 , involving for instance inclusion of a beneficiary &apos;s contribution in @-@ kind in eligible expenditure .
It is unacceptable for anyone to use the situation of the Roma to make party political attacks and to arouse hysteria instead of taking effective action .
During this visit Commissioner Michel did not meet with the Damas de Blanco or any other opposition representatives .
These tragedies demonstrate the terrible face of our fortress .
The Council has agreed to the obligation of the Member States to cooperate only .
This brought the real loss suffered as a result of the fine for the 15 @-@ minute violation to approximately EUR 1 750 .
Educating the children of migrants ( short presentation )
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - ( DE ) Mr President , honourable Members , I should like to offer the rapporteur my most sincere thanks for what is a remarkable report , and also thank her for her excellent , constructive cooperation in a very difficult and sensitive field .
Five years ago , on 1 May 2004 , 10 new Member States joined the European Union .
I would like to thank the shadows , who are here today , the Commission , who have been very helpful in getting agreement , and to the Czech Presidency , who are not here to hear my thanks .
Of course the Ecolabel should be given to the most environmentally friendly products , and the information should be clear and correct .
I would like to thank the European Commission and the Member States for their work on these regulations and I would also like to express my thanks for the major work carried out by the European Parliament , by rapporteur Linda McAvan on behalf of EMAS and the rapporteur Salvatore Tatarella on the Ecolabel and everyone else taking part in this work .
I feel that it is necessary to consolidate this scheme by expanding the number of organisations which apply it and to recognise it as a benchmark eco @-@ management scheme .
We have gone through a development process and I think that the experience is of interest in relation to the further expansion of Europe and the modernisation of developing countries .
( Applause )
( PL ) Mr President , I would just like to add that I also signed the resolution .
Yet we are all multifaceted : I support England in football , because I am English and that is part of my identity ; I support Britain at the Olympic Games in athletics , because that is a wider dimension to my identity ; and I support the European golf team in the Ryder Cup against the United States - and I suspect that even the honorable Member who made the remarks just now does too .
If this is implemented , the equal treatment directive will mean that owners and our landlords will now , in some cases , have to make deals that they had hitherto been able to refuse .
The evaluation of historic facts is the job of historians and historians alone .
Every child has a right to education .
Although we essentially support the principle of the free movement of the Union &apos;s citizens , we do not believe that people who have entered Europe illegally should be able to enhance their rights through marriage .
As a fundamental international player , the European Union cannot allow itself to stay one step behind in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energies in housing efficiency .
That is ridiculous .
Discrimination is a problem which , in these days of European unification , is a subject which is extremely relevant and which we must not ignore under any circumstances .
The 20th century was the century of major popular movements that were blinded by the idea that they were on the verge of history .
I do not actually agree with the rapporteur on the recommendations made to the Council and the Commission with a view to continuing negotiations with Russia , because I do not believe they are enough to guarantee a fair agreement that respects the rights and prerogatives of the European Union and that can promote the development of good relationships between the relevant actors .
It is a solid foundation .
I thank you and I await a reply .
Sometimes things seem different here .
The fourth estate , that is the media and the press , are an important tool in restoring democratic standards .
Another important element is the recognition of European transmission network systems that will provide gas supply security to European citizens .
I fully support Parliament &apos;s wish to have a single methodology for calculating cost @-@ optimal levels of requirements .
This rings rather hollow now , not least to the consumers from Northern Ireland who are in the public gallery listening to this debate .
A key task is to increase the generating capacity of European power stations and develop the cross @-@ border network .
Written statements ( Rule 142 )
It is the students , the travellers and the holidaymakers , but it is also the cross @-@ border workers , the journalists and the businesspeople who are handicapped because of very high charges for communication .
First , of course , the rapporteur , Mrs Vălean , but also the rapporteurs of the other committees , the shadow rapporteurs and the spokespersons of the groups .
Preventing irregularities also helps in assessing the benefits we achieve from allocating funds .
It means reducing the number of transactions from millions to a few thousand .
We stated in the interinstitutional agreement that we want declarations at a certain political level , which has been translated into the Financial Rules and Regulations .
Secondly , I would like to thank the excellent secretariat that has supported us in recent years .
The report clearly recognises the obligation of the Member States to respect the Safety Fundamentals stemming from the IAEA and the provisions of the Convention on Nuclear Safety , as well as seeking to reinforce the role of nuclear regulatory authorities and ensure their independent decision @-@ making role .
continuing the procedure to review the cohesion of our development policy , which is needed to support developing countries in their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .
One important point I would like to make is that great care has been taken in our amendments not to reinvent the wheel .
On transhipments of stocks subject to multiannual plans , Amendment 42 deletes the entire Article 33 . This is not acceptable because , as you know , transhipments have been used in the past to conceal illegal catches .
There are over one million of us in Britain : we are conservation @-@ minded ; we are sensible .
We are in a similar situation as regards the possibility of extending or , in any case , postponing the period for implementing the electronic system .
These political gimmicks are easy to spot but this does not make them acceptable .
According to the principles of IPA , environmental protection , good governance , civil society development , gender equality and non @-@ discrimination are all cross @-@ cutting issues and are an integral part of project design .
The item is closed .
Elimination of the comprehensive network would therefore have some perverse effects .
Firstly , the agreement reached on a regulation on credit @-@ rating agencies will help address one of the problems that contributed to this crisis and thus will offer some prospect of restoring market confidence .
The regulation also has a strong symbolic value , however .
But who has not made mistakes , not least the regulators themselves , and can we be sure they are now above making any future errors ?
All of these centres were supposed to have been properly regulated .
The answer will be given by the citizens , by rewarding those who are calling for legislation and punishing those who wanted to persuade us that self @-@ regulation is the panacea for all the evils we are experiencing today .
Certainly , but let us vote on this and work in the right direction .
How could it happen that , according to the agreement signed with the Hungarian Government , while completely ignoring the basic problem of European demographic trends , a drastic reduction in childcare fees was prescribed ?
However , due to the urgency of the matter and to ensure continuity , it has been fair to stick to the current legal instruments and limit the revision of Regulation ( EC ) No 332 / 2002 , establishing a facility providing medium @-@ term financial assistance for non @-@ euro @-@ area Member States to a minimum , i.e. to the increase in the ceiling as agreed by the European Council , and to some necessary technical improvements that appear necessary on the basis of the experience gained with the implementation of the balance of payments facility since last autumn .
Thanks to this a consensus was achieved , Amendment 39 was adopted , and this position has been confirmed by the Council .
When Parliament takes its decisions , it is most important that we have skilled and expert people - both men and women - in the committees .
But today &apos;s launch of the green paper on reform of the common fisheries policy gives us all an opportunity to change the common fisheries policy , and I hope Members will take the opportunity to circulate the green paper to as many constituents as possible to make their voice heard .
In this respect the possession of reserves is a matter of basic national security .
The third energy package must gradually develop the energy market , which until very recently was based on a monopoly system .
I voted for this regulation precisely to ensure lower charges for roaming customers , while at the same strengthening the rules on transparency of pricing .
We are not comfortable with this in Ireland , but we respect the right of each Member State to choose its own energy sources .
It &apos; strongly supports the establishment of a common European immigration policy &apos; , welcoming the &apos; institutional implications of the Lisbon Treaty , in particular the extension of co @-@ decision and qualified majority voting to all immigration policies &apos; , and &apos; the adoption of the European Pact on Immigration &apos; ; in other words , an inhumane security @-@ based immigration policy which criminalises , exploits and selects immigrants .
As the President of the Italian Republic , Giorgio Napolitano , said , the response to the events was immediate and effective .
For example : how many accounts outside the budget did the Council have in 2007 ?
You could say that , as a representative of a eurosceptic party , I believe that it should always be the Council that dominates European cooperation and that this Parliament should concentrate on the internal market and cross @-@ border environmental issues .
No replies were forthcoming , with just a reference made to a gentlemen &apos;s agreement - which certainly never applied to discharge , only ever to the budget meeting . Even then , it applied only to the administrative part .
The compromise also assumes that Member States will use appropriate safety mechanisms for preventing violations caused by cabotage on the road haulage market .
If Amendments 17 and 18 are not adopted , I will be voting against the end result .
The Presidency also fully shares the aim of boosting the competitiveness of the road haulage sector in the EU by rationalising and simplifying the existing legal framework and thereby helping to curtail market violations .
As for urban and suburban transport , two key texts will be put to the vote tomorrow .
We are , in any event , dropping regional transport from the regulation , but we are leaving open the option to include urban and suburban transport in it , should Member States so wish .
They travel to the US .
Within the OMC , Member States identify common challenges and agree common objectives for universal access , quality and sustainability in health care and long @-@ term care .
Subject : Discrimination against Polish shipyards in the light of the Commission &apos;s decision to approve state aid for the motor vehicle industry
The broadening of prospects for careers related to the sea cluster , which is also part of your question , is not directly an objective of the research policy .
This dialogue takes into account our long @-@ standing policy of openness and inclusiveness and it also reflects the wide differences in the policy fields and the diversity of stakeholders .
Let me stress that this proposal is far from a simple term extension .
Copyright protection currently lasts for a maximum of 50 years , and in my opinion this period is not sufficient to give fair remuneration to artists for their creative work and performance .
That is out of all proportion .
I therefore believe that local authorities have recognised that urban mobility is likely to be one of the major challenges of the 21st century .
Since the report is excellent and is right to give due consideration to the principle of subsidiarity , I should like , briefly , to address the link between urban mobility and inland shipping .
In order for us to improve our citizens &apos; quality of life , we must speed up the development and implementation of scientific research and innovation in the area of urban mobility .
My personal long @-@ standing fight for the mass introduction of eCall , the electronic emergency callout system , brings the urgency of this home to me almost daily , and intelligent transport systems can do so much more .
Firstly , the threshold for Motorways of the Sea has been reduced from 250 to 200 million tonne @-@ kilometres a year ; secondly , the threshold for traffic displacement projects has been reduced from 80 to 60 million tonne @-@ kilometres , as has the threshold for inland waterway projects , where Parliament pushed through a reduction from 17 to 13 million tonne @-@ kilometres .
The compromise arises mainly from an attempt to optimise rail transport as a whole while at the same time retaining enough flexibility to resolve crisis situations .
For that I would like to thank both the shadow rapporteurs and everyone taking part in the discussion .
Contrary , too , to what some of its opponents have said , this text is addressed to all patients and is re @-@ establishing more justice and more fairness , since , up to now , only the wealthiest have had access to cross @-@ border care .
He has done terrific work and I sincerely hope he gets well soon .
Seize it !
It is about high @-@ earners and the well @-@ educated , not about those with the greatest need .
I wish to concentrate primarily on a number of positive points that are in the interest of the patient .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are dealing with an important directive to secure substantially the right to mobility for European patients , the right to healthcare in the countries of the European Union .
Otherwise , patients &apos; rights , as defined by the European judges , would be undermined .
It is , moreover , preposterous that the directive &apos;s legal basis should be the viability of the internal market and not the rights of patients .
Mr President , I wish first to thank all the Members who have spoken on Mrs Sartori &apos;s report .
That is why we have directives , but it would be good to devote some attention to seeing whether this is actually working well .
2 . 2007 discharge : Court of Justice (
Therefore , I would request that we vote on Amendment 80 as an addition to 37 , if Members like it - which is a different matter - as it looks like we are also doing with Amendment 81 .
It was never intended to shield that from parliamentary scrutiny , and I think it is high time that we enter into talks with the Council to reconsider that agreement .
For that reason , Mr Trakatellis &apos;s report is unacceptable and this amendment is a scandal that discredits this Parliament , which has otherwise time and again served bioethics and the protection of unborn human life well .
This question was not raised in the report in a satisfactory manner .
I hope the Council and Commission can accept the Parliament vote to bring in this law before the end of this parliamentary term .
Healthcare is and must remain the responsibility of the Member States .
Consequently , the PD @-@ L group in the European Parliament voted against the report .
After many months of frustrated hopes and expectations , low confidence in the markets and deepening recession it was almost a political imperative for the G20 summit to end in success .
We welcome , in particular , the reference to the end of banking secrecy .
What is the real substance of the progress made on regulation by the G20 in London ?
However , the most important thing to realise is that the G20 initiative is not an event but rather a process .
The opposition is checking the electoral roles in order to produce evidence of this claim .
It may be that Commissioner Ferrero @-@ Waldner &apos;s instinctive optimism proves misplaced .
Those suspected of having committed criminal acts , including human rights abuses , must be investigated and , if charged with such acts , offered the right to a fair trial .
We support the agreements which have been achieved and we urge the political representatives to continue their efforts with a view to the next meeting of the Council for Peace Implementation &apos;s management committee , which will take place at the end of June .
The few jobs which may be on offer depend on the goodwill of the parties .
I support the lifting of the visa regime as an important step towards the integration of the Western Balkans .
That is why I should like to urge you once again in all earnestness , as instructed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , not to confuse the question of the civil use of nuclear power with a revival of the potential for nuclear disarmament .
Now the governments of the European Union are being called on to act and engage in specific nuclear disarmament .
I am extremely pleased that during the discussion in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we worked together in a spirit of goodwill and cooperation .
I firmly believe that the EU will continue with the positive steps it wants to take towards full social inclusion and full integration of fellow citizens with disabilities .
The Council has repeatedly grappled with this problem within the framework of various initiatives .
In order to implement the Copenhagen agreement it is essential to have sufficient , predictable and timely financial support .
Parliament is aware of the statement .
In order to provide greater transparency for consumers , industry and the relevant authorities and facilitate the rapid collection of data for consumers and SMEs , there must be an accessible database .
I will not go into the details , but I will take advantage of the time that remains to describe the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe &apos;s position on the CE label , one of the crucial points of this report .
Improved rules and greater transparency are crucial .
However , that is not our main problem today .
In my own city , London , the impact on young black men has led to tougher guidelines and safeguards - none of which , it must be stressed , should impede the intelligence @-@ led investigation of crime .
There was not , in fact , much willingness to follow our approach , and therefore the negotiations with the Council were far from easy .
We have recently received a letter from somebody who had tried to get a piece of legislation enforced and is now so disgusted with the whole European set @-@ up , having been pro @-@ European , that they now support an anti @-@ European party .
This was not previously available .
As a representative of a country , which is not in the euro zone , I am delighted that this regulation can also be applied , if non @-@ euro zone Member States wish , to payments in national currency , which in Lithuania would be the litas .
The Commission will prepare the implementing provisions for the new regulation in the light of your comments today , we will listen attentively to the experiences of operators , we will talk with our partners at international level and we will be fully transparent with Parliament during the whole of the process .
Since that time , this country has had a terrible history of suffering , and we ought to ask ourselves the question : what is Afghanistan ?
Therefore the European Union must support the awareness campaigns promoting gender equality and human rights .
Let us have these people and their human rights in mind when we vote .
The amendments tabled here in this House are profoundly mistaken .
I must say , Mr Staes , that we had already considered this issue , and that we are indeed going to look at this because it is a real issue and a real problem .
However , I reject the direct implication within this report that the European Union should replace the key Member States as the major actor in this particular process .
I voted for the amendments to the recommendation for second reading in the report on statistics on plant protection products .
This is something I feared from the beginning , and this fear has become reality .
This enlargement was followed in 2007 by the accession of Romania and Bulgaria .
Firstly , Russia has signed an agreement with Abkhazia and Ossetia which secures the presence of Russian troops in these provinces of Georgia .
Thank you very much , Mr Pannella .
But we should not focus unduly on the negative aspects of these events .
Communication is therefore necessary ; it must be explained to our fellow citizens that , whatever happens , it is not a question of letting their guard down , and that they must remain vigilant .
I hope that before the summer holiday I will be able to submit a formal motion to make their agreement binding .
I would also like to point out that these protection systems must be obligatory , otherwise they become arbitrary .
We have tried through legislation and own @-@ initiative reports to put into practice some of the principles already enshrined in treaties so that we can put &apos; invisible &apos; groups on the public agenda .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am shocked at the European Commission &apos;s position on my proposal for paternity leave .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am very sorry indeed that the Council and Parliament have failed to reach an agreement in the final round of bargaining over the revision of the Working Time Directive .
on behalf of the IND / DEM Group . - Madam President , President Klaus remarked on 18 February that the EU structure is a dogma which contradicts the experience of heritage .
( PL ) Madam President , Commissioner , it is a fact that after five years of intensive efforts to amend the directive on the organisation of working time we are bringing the fiasco of our endeavours to a close today .
The results were quite clear : 15 votes in favour , none against and five abstentions .
I must support the Commissioner : it is not the first time that self @-@ employed workers , too , have been included in the coordination of safety on construction sites in order to guarantee their own safety and the safety of others .
The parliamentary Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , for which I have the honour of acting as rapporteur on this issue , set a major objective for the 2010 budget at the start of the procedure .
You are potentially relocating the problem to China or to other countries , which will be able to accept these products .
However , I have some concerns regarding how some parts of the legislation may be interpreted and that it would have negative consequences for Sweden and our Nordic neighbours .
The regulation has been supported by many EU citizens , who are sensitive to the issue of animal welfare .
Research projects would move abroad , we would lose the huge amount of knowledge that we currently have and we would make ourselves completely dependent on other countries .
Finally , I should like to say that , over and above this proposal , which is very important and for which we must maintain the balance between the needs of scientific research and improving human health , while at the same time using methods which are not hard on animals , I must say that the Commission , all the while I have been Commissioner , has taken numerous measures to protect animals .
In practical terms , the directive harmonises the definition of ship @-@ sourced pollution caused by individuals or legal entities , the scope of the response to this and the punitive nature of the sanctions which can be applied in the event of any such violations committed by individuals .
This proposal addresses goods but , at the end of this year , before we have this proposal in place , we shall have the Services Directive in place and there are many issues for consumers around that .
This approach also supports an active policy of training of young conference interpreters .
In other words , we want to be able to collaborate to achieve greater social and territorial inclusion of European citizens .
Some among us may not be happy with this compromise , but I would like to stress that , despite its shortcomings , this is the best we could achieve with the Council , and I strongly advise you to vote for it tomorrow .
What is the position of the European Union and the Commission with regard to the new HADOPI law ( High Authority of Diffusion on the Art Works and Protection of Rights on the Internet ) on graduated response ?
I believe we have done something good .
The telecoms package makes a major contribution to the European Economic Recovery Plan through its development of the network .
In addition , the rules concerning privacy and data protection are strengthened in such areas as the use of cookies and similar devices .
The first relates to our proposal that advertisements should include a reference to energy consumption , which caused disproportionate reactions from the Federation of European Publishers and from radio and television station owners .
I think it is appropriate at this point to express thanks to Commissioner Piebalgs , who had a very difficult task , because making a European energy market out of the 27 separate markets of the individual Member States is a remarkable undertaking , it is a labour of Sisyphus which will not end with this term , and there will certainly be many tasks remaining for our successors .
Industry , medical research and animal welfare organisations are convinced that this is a step forward and that we will update and improve the current legislation .
We have only made a small step .
The Commission &apos;s proposal aims to recover petrol vapour which is emitted into the atmosphere during the refuelling of passenger cars .
I am also hesitant to antagonise Canada , which is a great ally of the EU and shares our common values .
Even this inadequate Commission proposal is dead letter following the proposal by the European Parliament not to punish minor ship @-@ source discharges of polluting substances .
We have to speak clearly and with conviction to the electorate about this Europe of results .
That is the kind of certainty citizens need .
Lastly , Deputy Prime Minister Vondra , you should withdraw your untrue assertion that 25 countries have approved the Treaty of Lisbon .
( LT ) On 9 May 1950 Robert Schumann proposed the &apos; Schumann Plan &apos; , which laid the foundations for economic cooperation between European nations .
If , in the next referendum , the Irish say yes , it will be more because they have realised that Europe is a safe harbour , particularly in times of crisis .
It would be easy for the Commission to present new ideas every day , knowing full well that they would have no chance of implementation .
The workshop on skills upgrading , which took place in Madrid , highlighted that skills are the key to preparing for the future .
This debate also provides the moment to draw together this Parliament &apos;s examination of the renewed social agenda .
The rapporteur , Mr Silva Peneda , has put great effort into this report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my colleagues from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have touched a raw nerve with their reports and have made it clear how essential joint action by the Member States and the European Union is to ensure that the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis are not borne by those who are worst affected by it , namely , those on the bottom rungs of society &apos;s ladder .
Much is now contained in this report which will be passed during this Parliament &apos;s final plenary sitting .
This half @-@ day troika is a pathetic response .
However , it is not a model that accepts only those who are participating in the labour market , because a large proportion of our citizens are , for various reasons , not participating in the labour market and yet it is very important that they should have the opportunity to participate actively in society and that they should play an active part .
But in recent years they have reached common agreement on several measures proposed by the Commission that are designed to tackle the erosion of tax bases and investment allocation distortions .
Thank you , Commissioner , for a very full reply .
The Commission is intensively monitoring protectionist measures put in place by its major trading partners with a view to appropriate action .
The last meeting between the Commission and the competent national authorities was held at the beginning of December last year , in other words a few weeks before the Court of Justice &apos;s decision .
It increasingly seems to be acting as the shoehorn of globalisation .
As cosignatory of this question , I emphasise that lowering the quality of production - which is the outcome of centuries of tradition and research , huge investments , passion and attention to detail - is not the answer we need , particularly at this time of economic crisis , when the average consumer is certainly paying more attention to price than to what is written on the label .
How do you expect our fellow citizens to understand such a stance on the part of the European Commission ?
It shows a change of mentality and I want to encourage the Turkish authorities to take further steps in this direction .
There are evidently strong lobbies that promote and desire at all costs Turkey &apos;s entry to form part of Europe .
These are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in our common European values .
I do not therefore believe that animals are being treated cruelly if they are not stunned after their throats are cut .
Related to that is the innovative amendment to say that we should have this blue card procedure to be able to interrupt each other .
. - ( SV ) Thank you , Mr President .
It is a somewhat curious fact that the Conference of Presidents waited so long to put this report on our plenary agenda .
I would like to conclude by thanking my colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who were involved in drafting the report , as well as the representatives from the European Commission and the Council for their helpful cooperation .
The Committee on Budgets unanimously decided that the reference amount indicated in the legislative proposal is compatible with the ceiling of heading 2 of the current multi @-@ annual financial framework 2007 @-@ 2013 .
What happens is the boiler runs out and the heating bills go through the roof .
I hope that you get the money but - as I said - I think in future we probably need to go about it in a much more uniform way .
I am afraid that this opportunity has been lost for the European Union and I am afraid that it has been lost mainly by the Commission itself .
It is also important to underline the solidarity in the distribution of the money .
We have not come up with an answer to the economic and financial crisis .
This is a crucial lesson of the financial crisis .
Then we will discover that very little should be done at EU level .
But this is only a first step in a very long process .
The Court has overturned the decision taken by this House on 24 May not to confirm my mandate following the proclamation by the national authorities , and the European Parliament has been ordered to pay costs .
The Treaty of Lisbon contains the central reforms required to make the European institutions more democratic , transparent and capable of action .
The legacy of a President of the European Parliament is always subject to political scrutiny .
That you can make such a speech shows that this is a free and democratic European Parliament !
rapporteur . - ( FR ) Madam President , I would first of all like to point out that , in relation to the request for a change on the voting list , if I have understood rightly , if the compromise was included by the services , using their common sense , before groups tabled the amendment , it is because it goes further than Amendment 46 . It includes clauses that are not limited merely to restricting access to the Internet but that also include all devices that may adversely affect users &apos; rights .
13 . Active inclusion of people excluded from the labour market (
in writing . - ( SV ) In the European Parliament &apos;s first reading of the telecoms package , a majority of Members voted in favour of Amendments 138 and 166 , which have been under discussion .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted for Eugenijus Maldeikis &apos; report on the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on EU financial support to projects in the field of energy .
Many animals are subject to treatment which involves unnecessary suffering , not only during their rearing and transport , but also at the time of slaughter or killing and related operations .
We have therefore tabled an alternative resolution which contains all the elements of her report which we do support .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I wish to begin by making a general remark .
Work at official level within the Council on the possibility of expanding the issuing of visas for human rights defenders is continuing .
In addition , I would call on the Commission , in particular , to pay more attention to the issue of Internet censorship because , on this score , Members of the four large groups of this House have launched an initiative for a Global Online Freedom Act based on the proposals put forward by the US Congress .
It should genuinely tackle these human rights and hold talks with us .
Evidence of all this is also provided by an exhibition of pictures which can be currently visited here in Parliament .
We thought at one point we might have got a first @-@ reading agreement on this , but time and , indeed , our desire to pull together the package of measures looking at the European common asylum system mean that we have not got that far .
The proposal also contains a mechanism for suspending transfers in cases when a Member State is experiencing particular pressure on its asylum system which does not allow it to offer asylum seekers adequate standards of protection and reception conditions .
Based on our experience of asylum @-@ seekers &apos; and immigrants &apos; illegal entry , we could then make proper arrangements for providing reception for asylum @-@ seekers .
rapporteur . - Mr President , I welcome the general support we have heard this afternoon for the European Asylum Support Office and would very much like to thank colleagues for their cooperation and the work that we have been doing on this .
The report therefore proposes setting up a group of experts to permanently monitor the application of Community law and the quality and effectiveness of justice , on the model of the Schengen mutual evaluation system .
Having established this - this is an exceptional procedure - I believe that the amendments that we have debated and tabled , and which I believe will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow , will make it possible to adopt this package of measures at first reading .
Subject : Protection of European creative works
By making solid progress in economic and political reform and by fulfilling the necessary conditions and requirements , the remaining potential candidates in the Western Balkans should achieve candidate status according to their own merits , with EU membership as the ultimate goal .
What possible compromise proposals does the Council envisage ?
In order to really exercise control over an administrative bureaucracy , national governments , the Commission or the Council apparatus here in Brussels and in Strasbourg , we must establish close cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments .
In today &apos;s Europe , where more than 50 % are women , they are still under @-@ represented in politics .
I believe that a brief glance at the area of internal security , justice and the police , its communitarisation , Parliament &apos;s right of codetermination , the application of the Charter , punishes these assertions and unmasks them as deception , propaganda and ignorance .
I am giving my last speech after 15 years . We have come a long way .
The written text of a treaty is not enough .
I believe that Europeans are very interested in true social freedoms , in those that offer families , communities and social bodies the opportunity to achieve real progress , and in a Europe based on subsidiarity and , precisely , on social bodies and a deep @-@ rooted Christian and Roman view of history .
Even this evening we can all feel the European ship being buffeted by the storms of the financial crisis .
When you talk about democratic accountability , let us not forget one thing .
This will help us make their accession to the EU a simpler , smoother process .
I think , at a time when we are trying to get the right balance between national security and civil liberties , I think many of us are fearful that more and more governments are collecting more and more personal data about us .
Actually it started in the United States of America with the subprime problem .
The concept of MEDIA Mundus is new , ambitious and innovative , because it promotes cooperation between professionals , which is not done normally by European programmes , and , unlike existing programmes , it is also based on mutual benefit , not only for our film @-@ makers but also for film @-@ makers from third countries , in different fields .
I should like to pay my personal compliments to you , Mrs Hieronymi , for all the work you have done , for the breadth of your vision and for your cooperation .
author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our debate today is particularly important , as we know , for two reasons : firstly , because we are talking about one of the substances that has caused most harm and deaths among citizens and workers at the plants where it is used and produced , namely asbestos .
When I was lying on my hospital bed , having my heart bypass and feeling sorry for myself , I was watching on the television the earthquake in Italy , and that put my problems into perspective .
on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is the first time I have spoken in this House .
Debating the suspension of the 80 / 20 rule is very important , but it can only be a short @-@ term measure and it must not be allowed to become part of the aviation policy in the longer term .
Restoring slots to the concept of public goods that can be authorised for use but cannot become the property of companies is a fundamental issue , although it must be handled with great care so that it does not instead become an instrument that threatens the viability of many of the airlines that we all depend on .
4 . European Refugee Fund for the period 2008 @-@ 2013 ( amendment of Decision No 573 / 2007 / EC ) (
Then colleagues are going to turn around to the Irish electorate and say : &apos; It is too late to vote &quot; no &quot; now , because we have implemented the whole thing , so all you would be doing is annoying everybody and isolating yourselves when , in fact , the bulk of the Lisbon Treaty is already in force de facto , if not de jure . &apos; 
Mr President , I know this place has little concept of what the people of Europe actually want .
We believe that the protection of national borders for us remains a key element of public policy at national level .
The resolution whitewashes the savagery inflicted on the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip - which the resolution of the UN Human Rights Council denounced and condemned - and does not have a single word of solidarity for the Palestinian people , who are victims of the most brutal violations of human rights , perpetrated by the Israeli Army and by the terrorism of the Israeli state .
I voted for Mr Brok &apos;s report .
Just this morning , four people were executed in Evin prison , with another eight having been executed in Taibad prison on 2 May .
While the leading classes of Madagascar engage in a power struggle through coup d &apos;états and fight over important , lucrative business contracts , 70 % of the population is living on less than one dollar a day .
His only crime was to be a part of the economic oligarchy .
We are aware that recently the judicial institutions have opened some judicial processes against opposition leaders in Venezuela .
Regardless of whether it is a question of freedom of expression , public access , privacy or whatever else , human rights are always inviolable .
Strengthening Europe from within is important , but it is also important to think about Europe on a larger scale .
This law is in direct opposition to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 6 ( 1 ) of the Treaty of Lisbon .
The third priority - or if you will the third &apos; E &apos; - of the Czech Presidency was about the EU in the world , and events demonstrate clearly how important it is for the EU to develop and pursue a common foreign policy .
In the European Council in June the course was set for an overhaul of financial market supervision .
The Czechs also managed not only to assist with the resumption of oil and gas supplies from Russia to Europe , but also to reach agreement on the Nabucco southern gas pipeline and to prepare it for signing together with the Commission President .
As far as the ambitions of the Czech Presidency are concerned and the extent to which the Presidency was technocratic , showed leadership , was visionary or whatever - I am sure it began with a vision for the EU and with a programme and also that it succeeded in fulfilling that programme .
On the issue of climate change , Europe has proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that it can take action when it wants to .
Despite costly border control , monitoring and data acquisition systems to prevent illegal migration , the Group of the United European Left / Nordic Green Left calls for the humane treatment of refugees and migrants and a change in economic and trade policy to effectively combat the things that cause people to become refugees in the first place .
On the second question about finance and the economy and what Mr Verhofstadt said : we can all have more ambition , and on that matter let me tell you that I share your ambition .
The crises have their origin in political decisions made .
This says more about the Swedish Presidency than it says about the EU .
The fact that up to now the Swedish Government has worked against this has unfortunately undermined the opportunities to get a good agreement in Copenhagen .
A number of the ministers in my cabinet are here with me today .
We have also been very clear in our response to what we have seen happening on the streets of Tehran .
We , too , condemn in the strongest possible terms the brutal mistreatment of demonstrators .
It is to this that we owe loyalty .
Whether that represented the majority of Iranians or not is very difficult to judge from the outside , but that it was significant is testified not least by the force of the crackdown that we saw after 12 June .
All this should be understood under the premise that I mentioned at the beginning of my speech .
But can we really compare it to what a communist dictatorship that has learnt nothing from the massacre in Tiananmen Square is doing in suppressing an entire people in a brutal and bloody fashion and threatening this people with ethnocide by means of a targeted settlement policy ?
The Uighurs enjoy many privileges in their region , for example they are allowed to have more children , they are allowed to practice their religion even during working hours and there are many other examples .
Therefore , I not only strongly condemn the coup d &apos;état against President Zelaya , but I also urge the European Union not to recognise the coup leader , Roberto Micheletti .
( The sitting was closed at 9.15 )
It is also strange to see this resolution adopted on the basis of Rule 106 ( 4 ) of the Rules of Procedure , which concerns the election of the entire Commission and not the replacement of a commissioner .
Mr President , I do not accept the validity of this Parliament or any other EU institution to make laws for the United Kingdom .
( DE ) Mr President , the economic crisis has hit agricultural production hard .
Slovakia must honour its international commitments , the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages .
As far as restructuring is concerned , I have read in the press that only one site would be affected .
We are not only talking about the approximately 12 million people who directly or indirectly live off this industry but the roughly 30 million people throughout Europe who are involved in this industry &apos;s economic output .
My party is in favour of cars , as Mr Verhofstadt , too , is aware .
What has not been addressed so far , however , is dealing with this subject in the context of European and regional development .
Is there not something fundamentally wrong with this system , and should we not look at the root causes of all that we are talking about today ?
This has been a constant request by the European Parliament , the importance of which , however , has been devalued by mistakes on the part of certain national governments .
( FR ) Madam President , this summer , Corsica also fell victim to some very serious fires , just like Sardinia , Catalonia , Greece , the Canaries and so many other regions of Europe .
Europe , too , must do more , however , above all , in terms of better coordination .
It is important , however , to try to extend the intervention to other disasters also , to increase the allocation for these disasters by pooling various funds , to simplify the procedures and to ensure greater coordination and flexibility , as Mr Mauro mentioned .
This is the most ambitious free trade agreement ever negotiated by the European Union .
There is cooperation on airlines , asylum and judicial matters .
Duty drawback is designed so that our response to it will prevent a particular problem .
The countries of the South lose USD 1 000 billion each year in funds transferred illegally to the North , USD 350 billion of which pass through tax havens .
Demographics will exert huge pressure on public finances .
The new Secretary General of the European Parliament and his colleagues discovered this and implemented measures which will bring annual savings of more than EUR 2 million .
It outlines common annual priorities in relation to resettlement , together with proposals on how to make more effective use of the financial aid granted to the Member States under the European Refugee Fund .
This is international maritime law .
Frontex must be properly resourced and respect human rights of individuals .
Ultimately , it is undermining Europe &apos;s political identity .
The countries of origin and transit and the Member States must also improve their sea rescue .
I must mention the fires that have ravaged my country , particularly in 2003 , and I acknowledge how important and useful mechanisms like this fund have been .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
It is not a bad thing that Parliament is a place of debate , and that Parliament is a meeting place for people who may have different views on different subjects , including different views on the future of Europe .
It was in the European Parliament , in the foremost institution of the European Union , that support began for the great changes which took place five years ago .
In the spirit of solidarity , I wish to express our pleasure that one of the key figures in Solidarność has been appointed to lead Parliament .
It is really a united Europe in which we have different standards of living .
They ran riot again on 23 October .
I also want to work more closely with the European Investment Bank to look at innovative forms of financing .
It is about the direction of Europe as a whole and that is not your decision alone .
For you talk about European values , you talk about European ethics , but the problem is this , Mr Barroso .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I should like to ask Mr Barroso : why the unseemly haste ?
They have not sold well , the &apos; Stop Barroso &apos; T @-@ shirts .
I very much regret that the majority of social democrats will not be voting in your favour tomorrow .
How can we suddenly start believing what you say ?
Not because they believe you will work for the achievement of an ever closer union with a powerful social appeal , but because they think you will call them individually to ask for their national blessing in advance of each European Commission initiative .
The next decade will decide where Europe is going to be .
Because you have not convinced me yet .
( NL ) Madam President .
Will you offer tangible assistance , i.e. expertise and material resources , to the central government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to help it achieve its roadmap and the criteria needed for its citizens to travel freely within the European Union ?
We have not seen his position on modified products .
They are now considering - with the additional aim of boosting demand - the introduction of a social security system , and I believe that they will have this system , because there will be a rise in prosperity in that country , and this rising prosperity in China is good for the entire world .
I fully understand , as Mrs Estrela and others have said , that the support of those who will be willing to back me is not a blank cheque .
( The President cut off the speaker )
Nevertheless , it is important to recall that development policy is a shared competence within the EU .
With regard to short @-@ term insurance , this has been facilitated by the Commission decision to temporarily relax the conditions to offer such support .
Firstly , that we have a common analysis of the problems that have affected our economies .
As you know , the Commission adopted a communication on the financing of climate change last week .
With reference in particular to the tiresome situation we keep finding ourselves in , starting back in 1998 , with LTCM , Hypo Real Estate and , of course , Lehman , and the knock @-@ on effects , rules should emerge from this that make it impossible to end up with the basic problem of &apos; too big to fail &apos; .
There is not one word on Europe .
I feel there is a very high level of agreement in this House about what is important in the European position and which issues we must concentrate on ahead of the G20 .
This could then stabilise the situation in the affected countries , not to mention safeguard the EU &apos;s entire internal market .
Mr President , Mrs Ask , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the US is an important partner in the fight against terrorism .
( Vote : 17 September 2009 )
My group is especially pleased that Sweden has highlighted the importance of countering the trade in humans and crime .
I welcome the Swedish Presidency &apos;s active role in getting the strategy going .
It will be what we make it .
These are the people with whom I would like to form the consensus that we need to enhance the European project .
The political guidelines for the next mandate of the Commission , which have just been tabled , reveal its President &apos;s intention to continue pursuing the main lines of action that were included in the guidelines of the mandate that is now ending .
The forest fire phenomenon is aggravated by rural depopulation , the progressive abandonment of traditional activities , poor forest management , the existence of vast expanses of forest planted with one single species , the planting of non @-@ adapted tree species , the absence of an effective prevention policy , the levity of penalties imposed in cases of arson , and the flawed implementation of laws forbidding illegal construction and guaranteeing reforestation .
It was thanks to the Czech Presidency that we managed to bring about quickly such successful cooperation between the Council and Parliament , as well as quick , effective agreements .
By way of conclusion , allow me to compliment my colleagues on their constructive collaboration and the Commission on its valuable help .
We should be clear about one thing : the freedom @-@ loving people of central Asia are among our most important partners .
These are important elements in alleviating the consequences of the economic crisis .
They are already issuing biometric passports and have made about the same amount of progress on the other criteria .
We have already been fighting for this in this Parliament for a long time and now a start has been made .
Consequently , I welcome the proposal on visa liberalisation for Serbia , Macedonia and Montenegro .
They have not been forgotten , however .
Madam President , as the previous speaker said , this law passed in Lithuania endangers European values , European law and also the freedom of people , namely the freedom of young people who are lesbian , gay , bisexual or perhaps transgender , to live their life without fear .
What we should be doing is concentrating on Parliament &apos;s intention .
( LT ) For the first time in the history of the European Parliament , in this honourable House , the actions of the Lithuanian Parliament are being debated in a negative context .
Unfortunately , I cannot promise that this will be solved before the referendum .
Which exit strategy and strategy for reducing public deficits does it prefer and what is the timetable for implementing such a strategy ?
Madam President , both the Council and the Commission have noted this and we will monitor the matter closely .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the dairy farming sector is going through one of the deepest and most serious crises of the last few decades : the fall in the price of milk and the more general crisis in the dairy farming market have now become a source of concern throughout Europe .
Let us also be clear that , for too long , European consumers have paid for a dysfunctional agricultural policy which has failed both farmers and consumers .
As a result , in Spain for example - Galicia to be precise - 14 000 milk producers have had to cope with root @-@ and @-@ branch restructuring in order to continue living and working on the land , but today they are still on the verge of imminent disappearance .
Commissioner , please stop stubbornly hiding behind choices made last year and take into account what is really happening on the ground now !
( DE ) Mr President , we saved the banks , because we had to .
The survival of milk producers is now seriously under threat .
Cyprus , for example , invests half a billion euro on LNG , and I regret that the Union assists with only EUR 10 million .
We must therefore counter supplier power with the consumer power of the European Union .
We should not , of course , underestimate the issue of energy efficiency , which is another important element in our policy of guaranteeing energy security for the European Union .
Next , how can we guarantee energy security ?
As regards diversification of the sources of supply , I would like to draw your attention to a neighbouring region which up to now has been characterised by stability and reliability in supplying Europe and which also has a huge exploitation potential and will become more accessible as a result of climate change . I am talking about the Arctic region .
Regarding the point on nuclear energy , we have moved away from this option .
Now , though , it seems to be once again the case that one form of guardianship has simply been replaced by another , albeit a more subtle one .
Energy consumption is continuing to grow , but the natural resources are limited .
The finger is being pointed at a country because its democratically elected parliament is in the process of examining a law that - in common with the laws that exist in the majority of the Member States - is designed to protect minors , and that is aimed specifically at protecting them from any propaganda promoting homosexuality , bisexuality or polygamy .
Thousands of small French producers are under threat of bankruptcy .
In this regard , solidarity with other countries hit by disaster remains one of the pillars of the European disaster @-@ management policy .
However , we are fully aware of the fact that many disasters of this kind have occurred in the past , and that many more will occur in the future .
Russia is watching closely to see whether we are in a position to respond immediately - and we must respond immediately by saying very clearly : put an end to the murders , to the violation of human rights and grant freedom to Chechnya and Russia , but above all put an end to the systematic violation of human rights and murders in mysterious circumstances .
However , we do think this Parliament needs to focus on the issues , and not simply to come up every time with a long list of problems in our relations with Russia , when these have no effect over there .
I am utterly astonished that , in front of the whole Parliament here in Strasbourg , we are having an urgent debate on a traffic accident in Kazakhstan , albeit an accident where somebody was tragically killed and where the driver of the car happens to a human rights activist who has been duly sentenced in a court of law to four years in prison - but even in a low @-@ security prison , which has suddenly become , in the terms of the resolution , &apos; a labour camp &apos; .

Documents received : see Minutes
This future could not be achieved by discussing and proposing measures alone , but also by devising mechanisms that can be implemented to avoid us facing a similar situation in the not too distant future .
This is one of the most striking innovations on the Treaty &apos;s democratic agenda and one on which this Parliament has already worked in detail .
The reality of the crisis , first of all , in which they felt that they needed Europe .
Oh , so you respect this vote , do you ?
Enlargement has not blunted the project .
Ireland is a democratic state .
I expect you to take this extremely seriously .
I would like to tell you all that if , 60 years ago , the founding fathers probably thought that Europe was the need to construct a common area of peace after the tragedy of the war , following the attempt by some to impose political ideas or hegemonies on others in Europe , today Europe has a different justification .
It is now up to the rest of us .
The voters were intimidated .
Moreover , our interests in the particularly sensitive area of immigration will be consolidated when addressing the concept of widespread solidarity .
It has not been easy ; there have been 10 years of debates and this will make us much more demanding , not only with ourselves , but also for future enlargements , in requiring loyalty , cooperation and the assumption of responsibility from all those who sign up to the new rules that will be in operation from the time the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force .
It is those citizens , and indeed all of us , who are the principal beneficiaries of all the actions of the Union .
You clarify these things by giving legal guarantees to the Irish people on taxation , on neutrality , on certain ethical issues and also making a guarantee that all Member States , including Ireland , will have a commissioner when the new Treaty comes into force .
The Treaty of Lisbon makes the fight against climate change a specific objective of EU environmental policy , acknowledging that it has a leading role , internationally , in the fight against climate change .
The nomination of the President of Burkina Faso , Mr Blaise Compaoré , as facilitator in the crisis on behalf of ECOWAS and the International Contact Group , is a very positive sign , and the European Union has welcomed this appointment via the Presidency .
( SV ) Mr President , Mrs Malmström , ladies and gentlemen , I am a member of the Committee on Fisheries and I visited Guinea myself last December , so I have followed this matter very closely .

We have now heard Hungarian MEPs talking nonsense about policemen not being allowed to respond to tourists in Hungarian or English .
At a time when we MEPs are highlighting the effects of the economic crisis and are adopting measures to speed up the process and simplify the regulations for accessing these funds , Member States are only benefiting slowly from these measures and not to the full extent .
We believe that this matter , if it is to be discussed , should be approached in relation to the Eurojust decision via the main door .
We have seen the introduction of rights to assistance and tougher laws on ticket pricing transparency , as well as tough compensation measures in the package travel directive .
In Lithuania , the Lithuanian airline &apos; FlyLAL &apos; also filed for bankruptcy this year .
Madam President , Mrs De Veyrac , Mr Vlasák and Mrs Gurmai focused attention on the cause of bankruptcy , in other words , the economic crisis and the difficulties currently faced by the air transport sector , by both low @-@ cost airlines and major airlines .
This directive needs to be implemented by all EU Member States by the end of the year and will make important contributions to a pluralistic landscape when it also comes to the online environment .
Thank you very much for your question .
It would link our Parliament to the national parliaments , to editors and producers , to journalists &apos; associations , to readers and to television viewers .
Evidently , the socialists have quite a few problems with there being at least one European Member State where the politically correct left does not yet control all the newspapers and all the media .
If we want to gain the respect of our citizens , then we have to begin by respecting the limits of our competences .
Prime Minister Berlusconi is the first to say that freedom of the press is very important , but the freedom to insult , to deceive , to defame and to slander is something altogether different .
In the meantime , the Commission has done its homework by establishing the risk indicators that will help us to analyse this whole problem in all Member States on an objective basis .
I am glad to see that both Europe and the most powerful countries do not underestimate the seriousness of the situation we are all in and are not looking for a &apos; one size fits all &apos; approach .
The EU Solidarity Fund is an example of effective , common EU action in a case when one of its members has been hit by such a tragedy .
We have voted in favour of Amendments 5 , 8 , 11 , 12 and 13 , and regret that the European Parliament did not go further in relation to accounting transparency , the fight against tax havens and environmental commitments ( &apos; New Green Deal &apos; ) .
The political representatives of the plutocracy are proposing this &apos; dignity &apos; to the working classes .
Signature of acts adopted under codecision : see Minutes
The factories that grew up in their place are outsourcing work overseas .
Mr President , on behalf of the European Parliament , I call on you to take action to ensure that this human rights activist , whose only crime is a thought crime , is released .
Russia has not spoken yet .
Therefore , Article 14 , aimed at sensitive information , emphasises that &apos; the reports drawn up following on @-@ site visits shall be classified as restricted .
This agenda is very often exploited by right @-@ wing extremists , who spread claims that the Schengen area actually allows various criminals to penetrate into the countries that are inside the area , and the citizens of our states quite justifiably ask us how we intend to prevent this happening in the future .
I therefore fully support the position set out by Mr Coelho and the calls on the Commission to withdraw these proposals and submit other , better ones , which take into account what has come out of this debate .
I have listened carefully to all of the speeches and I have certainly noted Parliament &apos;s virtually unanimous position .
We cannot very well ask Europe to open its doors to other countries if these countries do not open their doors to Europe , and this is amply ensured in these agreements .
You mentioned that there have been contractual penalties imposed owing to the delays in the visa information system .
We are obviously talking about a large investment when it comes to safeguarding European citizens &apos; safety .
In the light of all this , we are highly doubtful that the Commission is wholeheartedly working to resolve this crisis .
Second , offers in terms of financing .
For example , significant help to combat deforestation will be vitally important in a comprehensive agreement .
I would like to ask Mr Carlgren whether he has the Council &apos;s backing for his high ambitions .
The most important thing is that the developing countries themselves be given a say when it comes to spending the Climate Fund transparently .
In developing countries , the land is drying out and diseases are spreading .
A shortage of this gas will be far more serious than a surplus .
Developing countries need both types of resource .
It does not merely scrutinise the carbon issue , but is also a comprehensive policy on climate .
I have a concern in relation to the World Trade Organisation and a deal on agriculture which does not take into account the impact , for example , of deforestation in Brazil as it supplies beef to the European Union .
the other measure must be a plan for the future aimed at eliminating the causes of climate change by promoting a global economy based on reduced carbon emissions , combined with the promotion of energy security .
14 . Agreement between the EC and Seychelles on the short @-@ stay visa waiver (
In conclusion , it is my firm belief that if the Union wishes to remain relevant , then modernisation of its laws and policies must always be voted in favour of .
The exceptions are the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland , which are not bound by this agreement , and a territorial restriction with respect to France and the Netherlands , for which this agreement only relates to those countries &apos; European territories .
The creation of a European area without border controls , through the Schengen Agreement , was an important step in constructing an open internal market with free movement of people and goods .
When my wife asks me to do something , and wants to know if I will be sure to do it , I always say , &apos; Yes - after all , I am a politician . &apos; 
Yet what is your ambition in this regard ?
As a result , the sources of employment provided for people with disabilities have decreased significantly due to budgetary restraint .
We have improved the late payments issue by reducing delays in payment ; that was good and was very much welcomed by SMEs .
The honourable Members who were here in the last Parliament will remember that we always tried to improve cooperation between institutions .
Finally , I think that it should also be pointed out that in committee , we adopted a budget amendment of EUR 5 million to facilitate the integration of nationals from third countries .
The budget must have the ability to be tangible and dynamic , to listen and to respond .
Year after year , the Court of Auditors has been unable to give us satisfaction that the EU budget has been legally and regularly spent , and I was really concerned at the lack of control over taxpayers &apos; money when I was the chief accountant of the European Commission back in 2002 .
It is also a disgrace that the Netherlands is the third largest payer , after Germany and Italy , when it comes to the net contribution for 2008 .
Indeed , I would welcome the views of the Commission on these proposals , because these proposals would damage cohesion policy and damage places like Wales and similar regions .
Preparing a budget is never an easy process , even less so during an economic crisis .
We can do more .
How can we pursue a common policy like this ?
However , you are right to say that the situation is still far from satisfactory .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - I should like to thank the honourable Member for this question , which allows me once again to pay attention to this huge issue which is damaging to the budgets of the Member States .
The 2006 recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning defines the key competences young people should develop during their initial education and training to a level that equips them for adult life and which would allow them to develop very good job skills for the future .
The theatre had to stop performing its programme in September because of financial difficulties .
Tonight , we seem to be being asked to grant the powers to the Commission without first being told exactly what action they will be used to address .
Many farmers have waited too long to have the aid that is required .
We need to look at what is going to happen to CAP reform post @-@ 2013 ; the high @-@ level group is focusing on it .
If farmers spend their time and efforts competing against each other instead of competing with the strong retail sector , I know who the winners and the losers will be .
The aim is to be able to give a comprehensive picture of the EU &apos;s position on the issues that are currently under negotiation .
The task for the European Council is again to find creative solutions , to show that the European Union is united behind the need to fight climate change .
At the end of this whole process , it is absolutely clear and necessary that we have only one structure dealing with external affairs and not this parallel structure of Commission delegations on the one hand , and external action services on the other .
Indeed , he indicated that never before had so much money been owed by so few to so many people and with so little real reform .
We are probably going to have a High Representative .
These are not new subjects . However , what is new is that this time , it is possible to discuss everything from the perspective that the EU will really be able to function more effectively and that we will have a new treaty .
The EAS should be based on the Community method with the clear involvement of the Commission and the European Parliament .
The European Council will also approve the Baltic Sea Strategy .
Please ask the Commission President to take a look at this issue .
We will take decisions in a more efficient and democratic way and we will also lend increased strength and weight to the European Union in our global relations .
In the MPs expenses scandal now engulfing the House of Commons , only one MP &apos;s expense records have unaccountably gone missing .
Certain MEPs , who did not vote in favour of the conviction , should stop turning a blind eye , as what is happening in Italy , with respect to freedom , is a very serious matter .
Mr President , I think all of us in this Chamber are concerned about media pluralism .
I strongly supported the joint resolution co @-@ signed by my group , because I fundamentally support freedom of expression and am in favour of European legislation on media mergers , despite the opposition of the right , which has already been demonstrated several times .
in writing . - I voted for this joint motion due to my deep concern at the concentration of media ownership in Italy and across Europe . In Ireland , we have a possible similar situation developing and I hope the European Parliament will explore this issue again .
The aim is to prevent duplication and to ensure that all those responsible for delivering EU external policy work effectively together , and the Commission will also continue to have services responsible for trade , development policy , aid implementation , humanitarian aid and enlargement .
( The speaker agreed to take a question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
We must do away with traditional diplomacy , otherwise this service will bring very little added value .
This report paints a Utopian panorama of an external service that is to implement the Common Foreign and Security Policy ( CFSP ) , which is not yet functional .
The critics should understand that there are problems in the existing system .
Second , under the Treaty , the political accountability for the European Parliament is primarily through the President of the Commission and the High Representative Vice @-@ President and other Members of the Commission .
Another important issue is , of course , the financial and economic crisis .
And importantly , the TEC will have reached out to the transatlantic legislators &apos; dialogue and civil society stakeholders , too , so clearly we need the expertise and political thrust of legislators to tap the full potential of the transatlantic market place .
We need regular meetings between officials responsible for external affairs and security .
This goes beyond the issue of whether or not the administration has good intentions , and often relates to the influence of lobby groups on Congress , or simply the defence of its interests by a great power which is being shaken by the new world order .
The study has not yet been finalised , but is under way , and there are still a number of technical issues to be cleared up before it is totally ready for publication .
The Cuban Government denies the existence of political prisoners and regrettably continues to reject international scrutiny of human rights from independent human rights organisations .
Unfortunately , there have been no signs whatsoever of any improvement in the human rights situation in Eritrea over the last few years .
The Council would nevertheless like to stress that the Nord Stream project is a private undertaking .
If you have a question , you should submit it in the normal way in writing and then it may , if it is appropriate , be answered .
The European Community has reservations regarding any restriction on the exchange of biological material required to carry out the relevant research activities .
The final composition of this assistance package will depend , of course , on the needs which will be identified .
We may indeed provide funding for these but they will not amount to a real resolution of the situation or an improvement in the lives of the inhabitants .
I must specifically reply to some of the issues that have been raised just now .
We hope that the procedures can be finalised as soon as possible .
Other main conclusions of the mission remain of global importance as well .
13 03 18 ERDF - Competitiveness
6 . Progress of SIS II and VIS ( vote )
Mr Buzek very kindly said that it may have been because he was speaking too quickly .
This vote is the expression of the political Europe that we need , one that is capable of taking budgetary decisions that ensure a good future for solidarity , competitiveness and growth , for the benefit of its citizens .
in writing . - I voted in favour of these changes to the Single CMO because I believe that the EUR 280 million package is realistic and will be positively received by the dairy industry .
It is important to ensure that setting up the EEAS , as a result of the innovations introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon , will make it possible to preserve and further develop the Community model in the Union &apos;s external relations and maintain the Union &apos;s interinstitutional balance .
We did this two days after the massacre in Conakry , when more than 150 people were shot dead by government troops controlled by Moussa Camara .
On the other hand , in addition to imposing a total arms embargo , the Commission is inclined to examine the possibility of supporting reform in the area of security in order to reform the army and make it professional so that stability can be restored to Guinea .
The notorious thugs known as the Basij have now been incorporated into the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps , another sinister organisation .
There are those , including LTTE apologists , who want to deliver a further blow to the Sri Lankan people by undermining the GSP + preferential trade arrangements with the EU .
If this is not being done properly , then it is quite normal and necessary for us to call for the GSP + system not to be extended .
The world , in short , is a patchwork , humanity is a patchwork and each one of us is a patchwork .
It is twenty years since Europe &apos;s rift was healed .
Indeed , one of the key issues was to ensure the rapid entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty , which is crucial if we want to be able to confront the challenges that lie ahead together .
Presidents , ladies and gentlemen , even more urgent than the matter of the institutions is that of climate change , with the Copenhagen Summit being just a few weeks away .
This causes me serious concern .
I believe it is still possible , and we will fight for it .
The issue of the nominations is very important .
Finally , there is to be a Community policy ; at last , the European Parliament will be taking the decisions on it .
That stubborn man in Prague has finally signed and we have now reached the end of the journey at last .
I took part in a debate recently on the Irish public service radio , RTÉ , with a woman who was very concerned that we were cutting health spending and not doing enough to cut back on development aid spending .
A country which has a large proportion of wind energy in its energy mix has taken the liberty to invest in renewable energy resources when it has already developed , causing pollution in the process .
It is a good opportunity for the EU to evaluate relations between ourselves and Russia .
In the Caucasus , we must jointly demand unrestricted access for EU observers .
However , I think it could be even better if we included a third amendment stressing the importance of EU @-@ Russian cooperation in the area of energy , but also showing the basis on which such cooperation should take place .
That is like spitting in Parliament &apos;s face and we cannot respond by saying &apos; Yes , sir , great pleasure &apos; .
These are always discussed in our EU @-@ Russia human rights consultations .
The purpose of this is to identify and eliminate barriers to the freedom of establishment and the free movement of services .
In this respect , the European Commission &apos;s Handbook was not very helpful , because the guidelines that it gave were partly wrong and it provided an interpretation that was , in our opinion , incorrect .
Mr President , the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is to be thanked for highlighting this important issue , the implementation of the Services Directive .
Application of this directive has proved to be an opportunity for development of the European economy and has allowed jobs to be created .
A coordinated approach and a sharing of research are vital , as long as that research respects the sanctity of human life in all its forms .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the summer , the Commission adopted the Council &apos;s recommendation urging the Member States of the EU to engage in joint programming of research into neurodegenerative diseases .
Firstly , what is the relationship between the risks and benefits ?
We know that the Commission has set in motion a special mechanism for civil aid , a monitoring and information centre to coordinate the aid given to Ukraine by EU countries .
Our insistence on an inclusive approach should include a fair result by the 15th anniversary of the Dayton Agreement .
However , we must not forget that the issue of providing visa @-@ free travel is only partially a technical one , while it is a very clear political matter at the same time .
Why have these three countries had to ask for assistance ?
Our own country , Ireland , has benefited to a certain extent , and particularly the globalisation funds , which should be upcoming , are an example of that .
Violence is also occurring : today we were informed that a mayor from the opposition party and a guard had been shot dead .
What would you have said then , more than 20 years ago , if the EU had declared , &apos; yes , we are sending election observers there because the regime currently in office says that is alright &apos; ?
In order to meet this objective , we need something very simple but crucial : transparency , a concept that underpins the rules on origin marking , which were already approved by Parliament in 2006 and which , as the Commissioner mentioned earlier , are already largely in use in the main world markets , such as the United States , Mexico and China .
It is about saying that we need to move forward .
However , in my estimation , some other proposed changes would result in citizens having access to fewer , not more , documents .
We are pleased that Mrs Paliadeli has given her support to the proposal and I hope , of course , that Parliament as a whole will support it too .
The European Parliament is therefore proposing an extensive information campaign .
That is exactly what I am here for : to learn from your suggestions and your criticisms so as to be able to carry forward the work of the Ombudsman , the better to serve citizens in the future .
I propose that we start discussing these issues in the trialogue that we will have this afternoon .
That is your right , but for my part , I will say again that I am sad to see our sovereignty being crushed .
Then we would have a deletion , but it would continue as follows : &apos; calls in particular on the Russian authorities to adopt preventive protective measures as regards human rights defenders , such as starting an investigation as soon as threats faced by them are known by the prosecutor and the judicial system ; &apos; .
These criteria have already been met in the case of Serbia and Montenegro , but it has not yet been possible to give the green light to Albania and Bosnia .
Having said that , I must strongly condemn the revisionist efforts by the European left to gloss over the heinous crimes of Communism and to invent perfect worlds in the past , offending the memory of those who fought to free people from Soviet totalitarianism .
This is why concerted action at EU level is important .
This amending budget is premature , given that the Treaty of Lisbon is about to enter into force , as a number of issues still appear unresolved . I have therefore voted &apos; no &apos; .
The documents now available must be investigated at the highest possible level by the British authorities and Lord Kinnock given the opportunity to answer the Soviet evidence .
I do not think so .
It also has a reduced capacity to manage issues such as migration and crime at its borders .
We did not quite manage that but , thanks to the work of our rapporteur , it would seem that we have obtained as good a solution as we could .
( SV ) Mr President , protection for internet users has been the focus of a large part of the telecoms debate .
First , there must be clear and comprehensive information to users on the basis of which second users must give their consent .
The European Parliament &apos;s joint and decisive rejection of the provisions proposed by the Council , pertaining to Europol &apos;s work , is a clear signal that amendments to the legal basis now have to be applied .
In that declaration , the Commission reserves the right to take measures that it deems to be appropriate in the future .
Given that even the national law enforcement agencies are not granted this right under their respective constitutions , then why should Europol and , via the back door of the EU , the United States , in particular , be granted such unlimited rights ?
Even so , I would like to mention some of the reasons that have led your Commission to agree to table these texts nonetheless .
All too often , there is not only confusion between victim and perpetrator , but there are governments - and sadly the Italian Government has not paid much attention to this matter - which put victims of the same type of crime on a different footing from each other .
Moreover , in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on International Trade , I proposed to my colleagues on the Committee that they approve these two proposals without amendments , under the simplified procedure , and the proposal was approved unanimously .
Secondly , it is justified by the EU &apos;s own interest in contributing to the financial , social and political stability of our neighbourhood countries as a condition for their development and democratic consolidation , as this is also a prerequisite for our own political stability .
In this respect , I agree with it being the President who decides , and we will go along with that decision .
It is also the time for Parliament to recall who the cornerstones of this Parliament are , namely the individual MEPs , parliamentary committees and political groups .
It is gratifying that developed countries like Norway and Japan have increased their offers , as has Russia recently , and that developing countries like South Korea , Brazil and Indonesia have also recently presented ambitious plans .
I also note that some countries are moving , but others are not .
Thirdly , it is not just going to give us what Andreas Carlgren said previously , a lever to persuade the others , but also and most important , will be the pressure by example ; public opinion around the world will appreciate what the European Union is doing .
By 2020 , its chemical industry would have gone , a victim of excessive production costs .
Is it perhaps because Greenland was once green when the world was hotter ?
I therefore call on all of you to endorse the two amendments on this subject that I have inserted in our resolution .
Copenhagen should also help to change the global energy paradigm by supporting renewable energy and energy conservation .
2 . What developing countries must do to limit their emissions , and this applies to China and India in particular .
The resolution sets out specific instruments and it is important that we have quantified the actions .
These foundations are mainly ambitious commitments to reduce emissions on the part of developed countries , including the United States , adequate measures by developed countries to reduce their increase in emissions and financial assistance to developing countries to moderate their emissions and adapt to climate change .
14 . Common system of value added tax (
The European Parliament upheld the view that access to the internet is the right of every citizen .
I do not believe that this is the right course .
Bosnia is also situated in a sensitive region , so its economic and financial stability is especially important , as it will contribute to bringing about greater stability throughout the Balkan region .
In any case , I shall be in Kiev next week with the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , Mr Reinfeldt , to show once again the importance we attach to the reform of this sector in Ukraine .
My question , Mr President , is who will take responsibility for the reduced nuclear safety in this region and for the increased risk to European Union citizens ?
Which Commissioners will you give the task of ensuring that this takes place , and what is your own responsibility in this regard ?
The universal values that prevail in Europe , which are also the fundamental values of Christianity , would lose vigour with the accession of a large Islamic country such as Turkey . &apos; 
Drugs trafficking , people @-@ trafficking and terrorism are a reality on our continent , while at the same time , we have new types of crime , as a result of the internet , for example .
With the Swedish Presidency , we have celebrated once again the International Convention on the Rights of the Child , which is in its 20th year .
The Stockholm Programme , and regrettably also the proposed resolution , continue the linking of internal and foreign policy in order to facilitate the monitoring of everyone in Europe and the depriving of the people on our external borders of their rights , which is to be enforced by Frontex .
Two witnesses claim they were beaten and mistreated and forced to sign statements which they later immediately withdrew .
Our citizens need a pragmatic , forward @-@ looking and comprehensive European migration policy based on common values and rules , including the principles of solidarity and transparency .
As more than fifteen Members have asked for the floor , we are going to hear the first five .
I would also like to thank the chairmen of the three committees , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , for their very constructive cooperation on these matters .
Joint removals of irregular migrants to Afghanistan and other third countries ( debate )
This turns our idea of human rights on its head .
It must be said that Frontex has already organised group flights and has partly financed those flights .
This is because , from the outset , we wished to send a very clear message : we intend to work with great rigour to ensure transparency , accuracy and legality in the management of public funds and , therefore , in auditing the budgets .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on 23 April , this House postponed its decision relating to the Council &apos;s accounts because the Council had refused to supply Parliament with its annual activity report , preventing its expenditure being scrutinised in the same ways as are applicable to the other institutions .
I want to reiterate that the crucial problem for our small and medium @-@ sized enterprises is attaining the necessary venture capital in order to be able to pay for research and development .
I welcome the study and the inquiry into food manufacturing that is being carried out by the European Food Safety Authority as it has now been proven that shoppers are happy to pay more money for food which has related health benefits .
This is something I believe we should deal with and I would hope that an incoming Commission and Commissioner will take responsibility for this and do something practical about it .
They are still demanding the same standards , though , which means that the ones who will gain at the moment are those who are able to offer a special price / service ratio .
That is the principle issue .
Indeed , outplacement and relief require a rapid , firm approach , which is totally lacking at the moment .
We did , of course , ask similar questions in another place in relation to Nokia in Bochum and its relocation to Romania .
The first factor is time .
author . - Mr President , I rise on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism to introduce this oral question which has been prompted by recent accidents in Italy and the Netherlands , both of which , sadly , had fatalities .
That is not enough , however .
That being the case , there is a need to work on eliminating those deficiencies that do exist - above all , in the interpretation of the law .
The state provides financial support for the cultural activities of minorities and accepts the use of the mother tongue in commercial , contractual and other relationships .
If a Slovak deaf person can use sign language , let Slovak citizens use their own mother tongue .
For instance , we have extremely detailed websites and information in Catalan about the Community &apos;s policies .
The European Council will examine the report and give its opinion of the future direction of this important cross @-@ sectoral work .
I am sure this Parliament , with reinforced powers under the new treaty , will also show its sense of responsibility and its commitment to the Europe of citizens .
We do not want mere token gestures .
She has never been elected to anything and no one knows who she is !
We are not talking about theoretical cases .
I congratulate Mr Van Rompuy on this Euro @-@ realistic approach and will keep reminding him of it in the future , regardless of whether these reminders are expected or necessary .
( BG ) The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon should entail greater transparency , greater democracy and greater effectiveness for the decision @-@ making process .
We must pay much , much more attention to creating new jobs and securing existing ones .
I wish him well .
Mr President , I will answer a few short questions .
As a new Member of this House , I would like you to clarify , with respect to Rule 2 , whether a Member of this House is free to express his or her opinions without any censorship .
As they are very different from each other , the fund ends up reproducing the obvious inequalities among our own distribution systems .
This caused untold inconvenience for thousands of passengers who were denied the right to board duly booked flights .
Moreover , the effort put into the negotiations by the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy concerning flexibility in displaying the label will offer consumers adequate protection while simultaneously ensuring that manufacturers are not burdened with excessive bureaucracy .
In the new Rule 36 , we must &apos; fully respect &apos; those rights as laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I believe that the Copenhagen agreement should be binding .
In order to properly ensure children &apos;s rights , I would propose adopting standards of an obligatory nature in all EU Member States .
However , we must repeatedly answer the question about whether and to what extent citizens &apos; rights and freedoms can be restricted by the introduction of security measures .
In view of the need to guarantee consumers appropriate information when making a choice to purchase certain products , particularly with regard to their country of origin and the respective safety , hygiene or environmental protection standards applicable to their production - information that is necessary to make a conscious and informed choice - I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution , which calls on the Commission to resubmit its proposal to Parliament so that it can be debated in accordance with the legislative process established by the Treaty of Lisbon .
The previous three decades did not even succeed in fully implementing the Treaty of Rome .
It is a sign that the European project can still boast plenty of appeal and is considered a major factor of stability , particularly following the meltdown in financial markets .
However , it is also important to explain that the Copenhagen criteria apply .
So let us all work on them .
Secondly , progress in the various accession processes is subject to strict compliance with the conditions .
We must be wary of steps , conditions and values on which we cannot compromise , and I believe in particular in cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal .
I said that I was Prime Minister of my country when we entered the European Union .
Iceland cooperates closely with EU Member States as a founding member of NATO , a member of the Council of Europe , EFTA , the OSCE and the Schengen Cooperation .
The Council has raised the problem of violence against women on several occasions and in several different contexts .
It is therefore my wish for all of us that our cooperation will grow ever stronger .
In my country , the conservative right , which is under the thumb of the clergy , refuses to grant women full human rights .
The debate is closed .
It could , in due course , lead to China , and possibly other maritime powers , taking some responsibilities .
It needs to be broadened and made more flexible .
With the reservation of all of the difficulties , we should try to engage in supporting the transitional federal government .
That is why our proposal that the Commission conduct a Europe @-@ wide study into the problem , including third @-@ hand smoking , is particularly valuable .
I do not think we should be calling for binding legislation to apply to every Member State .
Surely this is a prime example of where we can achieve best practice among ourselves by all Member States ratifying the relevant conventions and promote best practice externally or globally by , as the Commission itself suggests , setting an example by ratifying the up @-@ to @-@ date conventions .
A good place to start would be for the EU Member States to ratify all of the updated ILO conventions as soon as possible .
The European Union must do all it can to help developing countries to develop sustainable farming and food production systems that enable them to feed themselves .
It is the lack of investment in agriculture that has led to this phenomenon of food insecurity .
These also include those people - representing the average - who spend many times more than this on food .
I think this really is an innovation .
We are forcing our farmers to go through a range of time @-@ consuming and costly practices , only to allow them to be undercut by meat products from outside the EU , with Brazil being a prime example .
I will be blunt .
For example , vaccination has been given greater prominence in the combating of the disease .
The next item is the presentation of the Court of Auditors &apos; annual report .
Our focus will be on the forthcoming 2008 discharge procedure for the structural funds and external aid .
The Court of Auditors &apos; annual report on the 2008 accounts shows no significant improvement .
In contrast , the Commission says that it wants cost @-@ effective control and suggests that there is a tolerable risk of error , which must be taken into account from the start .
We must take note of this auditors &apos; opinion .
This should be changed , and I stress : simplify and inform , but also monitor .
At Community level , simplification measures are under discussion in the Council and in Parliament .
I myself like to debate everything with people with different views , different attitudes and different assessments .
Secondly , publishers from countries other than the United States , the United Kingdom , Australia and Canada will now have to negotiate individually to become part of Google Books services in the United States .
Before making any decisions , I think that Parliament should initiate a European strategic conference bringing together the European institutions , the Member States , authors &apos; unions , libraries and even public telecommunications operators , to create a European public digitisation model that respects authors and their works and which makes them accessible to as many people as possible .
This is why it is imperative for Europe to devise its own clear strategy in this area .
I think that it is very important in this connection to ensure that the rights of women and children are implemented in any country that wants to join the European Union .
I prefer to see it grown here rather than imported from elsewhere .
Their traditions go back a long way to a period when the need to avert catastrophic elemental disasters such as fires always brought together a few dozen volunteers whose aim was to protect their own property and that of their neighbours and other people they lived with .
Judging from the debates which have been held in this Chamber , we can put a label on it : gender inequality .
I believe that adults have a responsibility in this respect , and where the legislator can intervene , it must do so .
We are concerned about hunger in the world and believe that a focus on food security is important .
This hurricane caused more than 200 deaths and missing persons , destroyed infrastructures and essential equipment , particularly in the areas of health , education , water and sanitation , exacerbating poverty in the country .
( Applause )
However , in order for such engagement to remain a sustainable option , dialogue and cooperation need to show tangible results .
This is so , irrespective of whether we are talking about a world power , or about small countries such as Laos and Vietnam .
China has stated to its own people and the world its commitment to human rights , including those of the minorities residing within its borders .
Order of business
They are often sent on with no guarantee that their rights and life will be respected or remain in the country with no protection or social care and , as a result , in the case of children , they fall victim to abuse and exploitation by various gangs .
That last statement , however , is highly questionable .
After the initial fall that we saw in autumn 2008 , this renewed drop in agricultural income can be expected to more than write off the exceptional income increases generated by the hikes that we saw in agricultural products starting in summer 2007 and then one year later .
We need to look at both these sectors , at how we are actually supporting them .
Fourthly , we must significantly improve and simplify the use of agricultural raw materials for the production of renewable energy by way of market regulation .
Above all , however , in conjunction with the revision of our agricultural policy , we need to consider what we can do about these price fluctuations .
Having demanded too much during the negotiations , industrialised countries have thus jeopardised the final outcome of the round of negotiations and the credibility even of the WTO .
It has decreased significantly as a result of the global economic crisis , but half of the remaining deficit , and in fact , the entire trade deficit recorded for the first half of 2009 is equivalent to our current trade deficit with China .
The post @-@ crisis world , which will be a world of interdependencies , will thus have to protect itself from economic nationalism and excessive protectionism by focusing on the regulation and preservation of a fair trade environment .
Globalisation , or rather competitive pressure , applies to almost all employees and employers in small businesses in the EU .
We need to take particular care - and this applies to Austria , primarily - to ensure that we use these sorts of measures to support those workers who need to be integrated into the labour market for the first time , and give them the opportunity , including with assistance from the European Union , to enter the European labour market .
In certain cases , they need temporary working credit and temporary assistance .
Without the euro , the Irish economy would be in hell at the moment .
Therefore , I suggest that the Commission consider not only those people at risk of losing their jobs , but also those who are finding it difficult to enter or return to the labour market .
I also call upon the Council of Ministers to take responsibility for finding , in the current crisis situation , a swift solution to combat unemployment and provide a lasting solution to the funding of this micro @-@ credit .
If a Member State makes such a discovery , it is obliged to inform all the other Member States and the European Commission of this immediately and put the necessary measures in place .
Fifthly , this calls , in particular , for better and more efficient market surveillance , because it is usually toys that have been imported into the EU that exceed the limit values set by the Union .
However , I must reiterate that you cannot expect me , and likewise I cannot expect you , to make a decision in respect of the disagreements among scientists regarding methods .
With total funds of some EUR 750 million available , more assistance can be given to the dairy sector .
Firstly , let me point out some key elements of the conciliation outcome .
This is the only way to create new jobs .
This budget is a transitional budget , one marking a shift towards the Europe of Lisbon , a shift within the major economic and financial crisis which has affected the entire world .
Hidden underneath all this celebration , however , is a much less pleasant reality .
The question is this : I should like an official explanation as to how our Union is going to stand with regard to cohesion policy and the Structural Funds , elements which seem to have been caught up in the eye of the storm affecting certain EU partners .
We also highlighted the tasks associated with the Social Fund , vocational training , obtaining technical qualifications and lifelong learning .
It is all about choices .
The economic crisis has affected the GDP of Member States and will influence Member States &apos; contributions to the EU budget .
The financial and economic crisis has brought with it an employment and a social crisis , and it is indeed predicted that there will be another 10 million unemployed people in Europe next year .
At the same time , the five @-@ year period of the Barroso Commission is coming to a close .
We want to help them to be closer to us .
I hope that will be a way of having more commitment from the European Council for a strengthened mechanism of governance of the European Union 2020 Strategy .
That is an interesting debate .
It feels good to be able to come back and report to you like this at the end of our term of office .
I would also like to thank Baroness Ashton for sitting on the Commission &apos;s side on her first appearance here , even though she has spoken primarily in her role as High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy .
There are , however , a series of new elements that I would like our guests to give their opinion about .
Israel is a democracy ; its values are the same as our own .
It is important for the EU and the US to work closely together .
The measures taken as part of the fight against terrorism must be proportionate , appropriate and effective .
That is the position that I wanted to set out here , Mr President .
( PL ) I would like to thank you very much for allowing me to speak on this subject .
The second technical run @-@ through was completed during June and July of this year and includes a number of the amendments that Parliament approved at the plenary sitting in March 2009 .
So my group - and I believe all the groups - have agreed to amendments that will reflect today &apos;s progress .
To do that , we need a first reading from Parliament .
We therefore appreciate the stated Georgian policy of strategic patience , which increasingly recognises the need to maintain links with the breakaway regions without restrictions , in the interest of citizens , and of re @-@ establishing stability in the region .
This measure is not only important from a human relations perspective , but it is also important because we know that South Ossetian and Abkhazian citizens who are Russian passport holders are already enjoying the benefits of this , which has created such tension that this is only aggravating the situation further .
I do not want to mention the six @-@ point Sarkozy Plan again , because everyone has done this , but we must remember that our contacts with such a powerful partner as Russia , which are extremely important for us of course , must also have reference to our smaller partners , which are near and dear to us .
In any case , the European Union , and the Commission as part of the European institutions as a whole , reacted to the crisis , in particular , with a series of measures that responded to a specific concern which , in relative terms , were more beneficial to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
EU money should first of all go to save common people , not banks or state bureaucracy .
( PL ) Mr President , I represent Poland - a country which perhaps does not have to worry about the crisis in the way that , for example , Hungary or Latvia do , but in my country , in spite of government propaganda , unemployment is also clearly rising , and a demonstration today in Warsaw was attended by protesting shipyard workers who have just received the last part of their redundancy money .
As a result , the International Monetary Fund postponed delivering to us the third tranche of a loan amounting to EUR 1.5 billion .
The economic crisis magnifies these disparities , placing additional pressures on the governments in these countries , which have to deal with stringent macroeconomic conditions , the social repercussions of the crisis , while also having to resolve problems arising from the vulnerability of the financial system and the sustainability of the public health care and social insurance systems .
Turning to specific issues , firstly , I am aware of the problem of the reapproval of small capacity establishments .
Firstly , recognising their suffering , protecting them and assuming that the victims are not only those who are killed and injured but also their families , those who are threatened and their freedom , which is the freedom of all .
I will start with a general remark : obviously nobody - let us look first at the substance of this ruling - could consider the removal of someone and something which was already there to be an act of democracy and freedom , as some have claimed , but rather an action of the thought police , an anti @-@ democratic act .
For this reason , I believe it is a good thing that we are calling for subsidiarity in this area and that every country can go its own way .
I say : shame on the Commission .
I would also like to welcome President Barroso .
I very much welcome all the proposals to give the European Council more consistency and more continuity in its work .
However , ultimately - and this is not your fault , Mr Reinfeldt , but the fault of the system - it has had no influence on the big decisions , including those that are currently being made in Copenhagen , because a single rotating presidency cannot influence very much at all , it can only coordinate , and there is a difference between coordinating and influencing .
The Presidency has not been active in opposing illegal immigration even with regard to integration projects and dealing with the problem of refugees .
It is a different European Union - a stronger and a better Union - for a number of reasons , some of which I as a Swede am very proud to mention .
We can pursue climate policy in the style of China or the US by making grand proclamations but not achieving any results .
( NL ) Mr President .
( PL ) I , too , would like to add my voice to the expressions of thanks which are being made to the Swedish Presidency , and to Mr Reinfeldt personally for his efficiency , and also for the excellent way in which he has achieved the priorities of the presidency .
I think it is important to have this from the beginning of the discussion of the European Union 2020 Strategy .
I shall put all my efforts into it and will monitor it closely .
For this reason , I voted in favour of this Fund in the certainty that it will constitute a fundamental tool of professional and hence social integration for workers who have lost their jobs .
I think one way of effectively limiting the crisis is to expand world trade .
His ideas were transferred to the practical level by the human rights organisations created by Soviet dissidents - first and foremost , the Moscow Helsinki Group , represented here today by Lyudmila Alexeyeva .
An overall initiative is required .
Member States will align policies with the resources to back them , and I hope to merge the EU Special Representative and the Head of the EU Delegation into a single post as soon as possible .
It is a murderous , pointless war that simply cannot be won .
In Afghanistan , I hope that we have learnt from the mistakes of the past and that we will adapt our policies and structures accordingly .
I wanted to mention this statement to you in order that , alongside corruption , this problem might also be given adequate consideration in the action plan .
Undoubtedly , it is also necessary to increase the military and police contingent and redouble efforts in the areas bordering Pakistan , to prevent the flow of arms and drugs between the two countries .
There is another issue which has been revealed by the media only today , namely a new draft law prepared by Alexander Lukashenko designed to totally control the Internet , as in China or even in North Korea .
The latest changes in position at the top political level in Minsk point to a harder line .
This would contribute to the development of civil society and facilitate a process of democratisation , which would enjoy popular support and be initiated by the people itself .
The scale of the challenges implies the need for long @-@ term policies .
With the post @-@ Lisbon creation of our External Action Service , the European Union must take its place on the international stage as a more proactive facilitator of dialogue and a sponsor of peace .
The EU is already highly committed to achieving long @-@ term stability , security and development in the country .
As part of this Plan , in June 2009 , the Council and the European Parliament adopted a Regulation amending the Regulation on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
The larger developing countries have put their bids to limit their growth of emissions on the table - China , India , Indonesia , Brazil , South Africa and South Korea - and this accounts for significant contributions .
We are all aware of the social problems following in the wake of the economic crisis .
Many urgent issues were discussed , such as freedom of expression , reform of the penal code , including the death penalty , as well as freedom of religion and religious tolerance , including the situation of the adherents of Plum Village .
There is still a lot to do , but we have come quite a long way .
My colleagues from the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection did the honour of appointing me as rapporteur for the European Solvit network .
The Member States &apos; disinterest in collaborating with each other is also reflected in the incoherent manner in which they perceive the internal market information system .
For years , we have talked about the need to unlock , to mobilise , the development potential of all European regions and cities .
As a result , European resources will also be allocated to richer countries and their regions with a lower GDP .
Renationalising this policy would be unacceptable for us .
I think it is very important to realise that there are huge poverty gaps within regions .
( EL ) Mr President , my fellow Members have covered the basic issues of today &apos;s debate .
Thanks to the efforts of all the groups involved , we succeeded in reconciling differing positions and arriving at a common text for a resolution .
( Applause )
At the same time , the price for Russian citizens is half as much .
On the other hand , the European Council &apos;s announcement , last Friday , of the willingness of the EU and its Member States to contribute to the financing and prompt implementation of EUR 2.4 billion per year from 2010 to 2012 to help developing countries combat climate change is along the right lines .
It will ensure funds are directed to various important projects and will provide much needed support , especially in the light of the economic difficulties still facing the European Union .
Such a turn would ease the development of all sorts of ties with this state .
I am not able to acknowledge other new points of order .
This proposed law includes provisions to punish those alleged to be lesbian , gay or bisexual with life imprisonment and even the death penalty .
It is significantly more difficult to force institutional change .
This will have important elements related to the rule of law and independence of the judiciary .
I think that , in our dialogue with the United States - our major ally - this issue of the death sentence should come up .
They are seeing their homes demolished .
The Commission has blocked the fisheries agreement with Guinea because government actions there resulted in the death of 150 demonstrators .
This is a major test of EU foreign policy in the new world of the Lisbon Treaty .
However violent the earthquake was , it alone does not explain the extent of the damage .
Finally , the reconstruction phase represents an immense challenge .
Within this emergency , however , there is another : the emergency involving the children , the weakest sector of the population , who have been left with no family , no protection and no State .
I take on board and understand the frustration that honourable Members feel , that there are issues which could be handled better .
It will take generations for the people of Haiti to fully recover from what will hopefully be a once in a lifetime event .
We must , however , keep the communication channels to the outside world open .
According to the terms of this covenant , Iran must recognise political parties , trade unions , non @-@ governmental organisations , the right to association , freedom of expression , etc .
I convey here the anxiety , not only of Israel , but also of the Emirates , about Iran &apos;s nuclear programme .
A significant package is now being prepared to help boost government efforts : training and equipment for law enforcement , a better legal framework and criminal justice system , work on anti @-@ radicalisation and conflict prevention .
On the other hand , one should know that the Yemeni authorities have more than once been accused by various human rights organisations of torture , inhumane treatment and extrajudicial executions .
In late October , Yemeni officials reported that they had intercepted a vessel laden with weapons from Iran .
These interests are increasingly being defended by military means , and with ever greater aggressiveness .
There is no legislation to protect minorities in Iraq .
( LT ) In recent years , the European Union has greatly strengthened its relations and influence in the countries of the Near East .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the revision of the Cotonou Agreement gives us an opportunity to learn lessons from the crises that we face : the economic and financial crisis , the social or food crisis , climate change , energy challenges and the persistence of extreme poverty .
For the sake of consistency and effectiveness , I insist that the parliamentary bodies in charge of monitoring the EPAs are made up of members of the JPA in order to better guarantee their development dimension .
It must , at last , tackle the issue of developing countries as a problem that is truly ours , as a problem that concerns us , the day @-@ to @-@ day lives of our communities , to be tackled day by day together with the local institutions which are on an endless quest for a glimmer of legitimacy .
Then , there are principles to which we should remain totally committed : human rights and migrant rights , and I urge you to retain my proposed wording of Article 31 and not quell the protests against bilateral agreements which , in reality , constitute an outsourcing of migratory flows .
The lack of balance between the rights of suspected and accused persons , on the one hand , and the instruments which the prosecution has available , on the other , may jeopardise the principle of mutual recognition of decisions .
To restate Zola , &apos; J &apos;accuse &apos; - I accuse - the parties of the British political establishment : their support for the European Arrest Warrant has put everyone in Britain at risk of random arrest .
We have found that within the Commission , certain DGs , certain Directorates @-@ General , do not really coordinate their policies , and the flow of information between them is also unsatisfactory .
I would appreciate an answer to this question .
Those who provide such services and those who use them consciously should also be faced with sanctions .
It is happening in Europe and we must tackle it from Europe .
Last Monday , the Council of Ministers on Development met , and next Monday the Council on European Affairs will meet in order to plan a rapid response in terms of aid and humanitarian cooperation on all fronts , for the future of Haiti .
In order to achieve this , there are new instruments that we are going to launch and promote in the next six months .
It is a vision of development of the European Union , based on the Community method .
We must acknowledge that our approach failed .
If it proposes progressive policies to stimulate economic growth , to deal with climate change , to strengthen individual freedom and responsibility , and to encourage cooperation on the world stage where we share common interests , all of these are areas where Europe can offer a benefit rather than impose a burden .
I think this is an important matter .
There are those who think that economic policy is a purely national matter .
Young people in particular are in a quagmire .
My second question concerns the role of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs : after Lisbon , who among yourself , President Van Rompuy and President Barroso , is responsible for explaining to Baroness Ashton that perhaps after 12 days , it is time to get on an aeroplane and fly to Haiti ?
After all , in that regard , Parliament was disappointed in the compromise on financial supervision reached by the Council last December .
On the other hand , the globalised world - and you have referred to it with intelligence - means that new centres of power are emerging and it is necessary for the European Union to take a more active and coherent role in defence of its values and interests .
There have been a very high number of interventions , specific questions , which would be impossible to deal with completely in my response , without prolonging this session entirely unacceptably .
The Spanish Presidency &apos;s main interest is the Mediterranean area , which can bring major benefits to Romania as well .
It seems rather strange that the Spanish Presidency is calling for us to combat the economic crisis and wants to make implementation of the economic policy objectives mandatory .
The way chosen by euro @-@ unifying monopoly capital is to strengthen the imperialist policy of the EU with new political and strategic intervention mechanisms , such as the &apos; European External Action Service &apos; , to strengthen its militarisation with &apos; combat groups &apos; and to increase their penetration with NATO .
The European Ombudsman acts in order to tackle cases of poor administration by Community institutions and bodies , either on his own initiative , or by following up a complaint .
She was also Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Justice and Home Affairs .
I am certain that this revision will be able to strengthen the partnership relations between the EU and ACP countries and to ensure greater synergy and cooperation in view of the common objectives to be achieved .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Mr President , recent events have once again reminded us all how important it is that we share information in order to ensure the security of EU citizens .
On a daily basis , 8 000 monetary institutions from 200 countries communicate with each other via the channels of the society , which is based in Belgium , with data centres in the Netherlands and the US .
Will you eradicate the developing countries &apos; distrust by noting the value of the Kyoto agreement as a basis for continued work on a global climate agreement ?
There is absolutely no agreement among Member States about what we should do now .
Everyone was glowing with optimism , but it came to nothing .
With regard to the Kyoto target , which was an 8 % reduction , European companies have achieved a reduction of just under 13 % .
These include their enormous foreign debt , an amount that is truly astronomical when compared with the level of funding announced , and which severely limits any real possibility of sustainable economic and social development .
Europe must be much more assertive in standing up for itself and , in doing so , should continue to set ambitious targets involving targets and emissions reductions of 30 % .
It needs to be pointed out that without the United States , China and India , and this has also been said many times in this Chamber during this debate , there will be no success with the objectives set by the European Union at the Copenhagen Summit .
Therefore , within the framework of the European Union , it is worth proposing a sustainable approach which would make possible the financing of appropriate measures of our own , first of all , within the EU .
The fact that the summit took place under the aegis of the UN highlights that even the developing and poorly industrialised countries realise that they need to play an active role in cutting greenhouse gas emissions .
The problem of ensuring that companies have sufficient access to capital and also the actions taken by Member States to that end have been a matter of concern to the Council for some time , as you are aware .
The European Union &apos;s position was along these lines and , despite the varying degrees of disappointment arising from the failure to fulfil some of the Copenhagen objectives , certain technical matters concerning the importance of tropical deforestation , which must be dealt with in developing countries as a key factor in preventing CO2 emissions , were clarified .
There is also a voluntary part made up of optional practices .
Monetary union moved forward , but economic union stopped and those synergies of coordination of economic policies in the European Union did not emerge , which , in short , is what should happen .
So , finally , a party whose Turkish name translates as the &apos; Democratic Society Party &apos; is gone , but its aim of a democratic society in a modern Turkey must not be lost .
A cynic might say that , electorally , it suits the AKP party rather well to have the DTP closed , as they are electoral rivals in the south @-@ east .
( DE ) Madam President , I would like once again to point out that the Kurdish Democratic Society Party ban means that a total of 27 Kurdish parties have been banned by the Turkish Government in recent years .
Turkey continues to deny fundamental rights to Kurds and other minorities .
We have seen tremendous democratic transformation in Turkey in the past five years .
I hope that Mr Rehn has also told the many partners he has spoken to that the European Parliament will be duly involved in drawing up the common strategy for the Danube Region .
In it , we aim to tackle the administrative issues surrounding this broad approach together , and ask the Commission to join us .
I would also like to express my support for inclusion of certain non @-@ Member States of the European Union in this project , in particular , Croatia , Serbia , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro , and a further two countries .
The outcome is the exact opposite of that expected .
On the other side , the reports also highlight shortcomings , in particular , in the areas of justice , freedom of expression and association .
The fact is , Commissioner , the Commission &apos;s report on the implementation of the Neighbourhood Policy is unsatisfactory in this regard ; it is a clear case of double standards .
It is affecting Europe &apos;s cooperation with the country , and a tangible improvement in this situation represents one of the conditions for the opening of negotiations on an advanced status for the EU @-@ Tunisia partnership .
Although the attack can be seen as a criminal act of individuals , various other troubling incidents require our ongoing focus on respect for all minorities in Egypt .
Mr Wilders , as a Dutch parliamentarian and leader of the Party for Freedom in the Dutch Parliament , is being prosecuted for expressing his opinion .
Egypt &apos;s Constitution provides for freedom of belief and free practice of religion .
It is common knowledge that , to establish themselves in China , operators must comply with the Chinese authorities &apos; request to install software filters , which even Google has ended up agreeing to do .
The Commission thinks that this is another worrisome development in the framework of freedom of expression in China .
It is therefore of the utmost urgency that the Philippine Government should take effective measures to put a stop to this .
Motion for a resolution
Despite the high degree of political instability in recent years , it can be seen that democracy in Ukraine has solid foundations .
This will enable an ever @-@ increasing number of people to learn that looking after their health starts with diet .
Just this week , a newspaper column written by a very well @-@ known journalist , Mário Crespo , was also censured at the prompting - or apparently at the prompting - of the Prime Minister .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to raise a subject which has already been mentioned , but I would like to reinforce what has been said .
The Commission &apos;s proposal thus provides the opportunity to eliminate this risk that is being taken when intra @-@ community trade takes place .
The Commission will continue to contribute to the Council negotiations on the remaining parts of the proposal as constructively as possible .
The second has to do with offshore companies .
If you want to shut down or limit the existence of tax havens , you must cut taxes .
However , we must work to change the policy in our country rather than shirking our responsibilities .
The southern nations are known in English by the harsh acronym PIGS ( Portugal , Italy , Greece , and Spain ) .
in writing . - I just wish to raise one particular point regarding cooperation on taxation between Member States .
Only then will there be a clear vision for both industrial policy and a social Europe .
( DE ) Commissioner Špidla , Madam President , the Commission should protect European interests and on that point I agree with what previous speakers have said .
Over the last year or two , we have had many examples of such State protectionism being extended to the producers of various goods , and also a variety of reactions and decisions from the European Commission .
I agree with the European Parliament when it stresses the importance of enabling fathers to play a greater role in family life .
Several questions came up in connection with the report .
We must also emphasise the double discrimination that sometimes affects women due to a handicap , to age or to their membership of a national minority .
The Commission has yet to present for debate a proposal related to the application of the principle of equal pay for men and women .
I will merely ask this question because I do not think it is a banal one .
The percentage of women representing Romania is 36 % .
The roadmap beginning next year must stress - just like the present one - the phenomenon of multiple and &apos; sectional &apos; discrimination , while paying closer attention to women &apos;s rights aspects of the situation of ethnic minorities .
During this mandate , we will also focus on the budget review and new financial perspectives .
( Applause )
If you take the path of reform , if you show yourself to be a genuine reformer , then you can count on our support and cooperation .
This is a practice that we in this Parliament can no longer tolerate .
We do not think that the Treaty of Lisbon is the most important thing .
Spain and Portugal are also struggling with increasing difficulties .
This monopoly existed when the European Parliament was not what it is today , so I welcome the half @-@ way solution which takes into account our initiatives in legislative matters , and which you have accepted .
We need to be more competitive and for this we need to provide better support for the infrastructure .
Since its creation with 11 participants , the euro area has grown to comprise 16 Member States .
I said this in my guidelines , before the Heads of State or Government , and I am going to repeat it at the informal European Council , the day after tomorrow , because I am convinced of it .
The relevant rules will have to be tailored to the effects that we consider must follow as a result .
Each of the speakers will have one minute .
You can play that game with others , but not with us .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Schulz has referred to me - not by name but precisely enough - as having been found guilty of revisionism by the French courts .
We heard Mr Barroso talk about a Europe that responds to a crisis .
The spirit of the Lisbon Treaty is clearly present within this document , with the expansion of Parliament &apos;s responsibilities , the equal treatment for Parliament and the Council and Parliament &apos;s new prerogatives with respect to various matters .
The new structure of the Commission , with one portfolio exclusively for Climate Change and another that combines Innovation and Research , gives clear evidence of an ambitious project and a credible strategy for Europe through to 2020 .
However , I believe that a vote for this College is the most appropriate option at a time when any delay in making this decision could have put the EU in an uncomfortable situation where accusations of inefficiency would have been justified .
The Commission has also reaffirmed this goal .
We need to move from monetary union towards true economic union , as stated in the treaties .
That is indeed the only reason , ladies and gentlemen , that explains why there is a rate on Greece , with its 12.7 % deficit , while there is no rate on the United Kingdom , with its 12.9 % deficit .
The Netherlands made a start on this as much as a year ago .
Although it appears that there are indications of a burgeoning recovery , the forecasts for this year show a drop in employment and an increase in public debt in the European Union .
We also need to activate European solidarity and to promote international initiatives on a global green new deal .
This is stated in the Treaty of Lisbon , and I am therefore very much in agreement with moving towards harmonisation .
This therefore seemed to be incompatible with maintaining the Guantánamo detention centre , which had also become one of the pretexts for propaganda most frequently used by al @-@ Qaeda .
I can give you a list of British citizens who have been forced into imprisonment in this way , into squalid and unfit jails , not at the hands of the CIA and its rendition programme , but at the hands of the EU Member States under the European arrest warrant which this House created .
With regard to Yemen , I do not have any evidence that a specific decision has been made or is to be made connecting Yemen with prisoners that come from there and are in Guantánamo .
The Presidency , working together with the Member States and the Commission , will attend the Doha conference in this spirit , and will work constructively to ensure its success .

Inclusion of the bluefin tuna in Appendix I to the CITES convention would appear to be fully justified and the only way to prevent its becoming extinct .
In 2006 , the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna agreed on an action plan designed to improve reporting and monitoring of stocks and inspection of vessels .
The animals are registered , ringed or , in the case of larger animals , tagged with chips so that they can be identified if necessary .
Throughout the consultation process , I have also been able to emphasise a number of points , which I will reiterate for you now : 1. expansion to all EU states , to all 27 Member States of the European Union ; 2. the criteria of sustainability ; and 3. the creation of more specific criteria for the integration of this type of building project into society ; many of the present locations do not actually meet the criteria and instead represent bad housing in bad places .
In every fourth region , per capita GDP is 75 % lower than the average for the 27 EU countries .
These changes will expand the use of the ERDF in the housing sector in favour of marginalised communities since , at the moment , this fund can only be used for urban development operations .
New Commissioner , Štefan Füle , who was a former colleague of mine when I was Europe Minister - and I would like to welcome him and congratulate him on his appointment - is going to be extremely busy with the enlargement issue as far as Croatia is concerned , because as soon as next week , we plan to hold an initial intergovernmental conference at ministerial level to open the chapters on fisheries and the environment , two very important chapters that , as you can imagine , will require an enormous amount of work and dedication .
However , the Commission has concerns following the decision of the Constitutional Court to close the pro @-@ Kurdish party represented in Parliament , the DTP .
Three negotiating chapters remain to be opened by the Council .
5 . Finally , a strict bringing into line of relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran with transatlantic policy on Tehran and its controversial nuclear programme .
On the contrary , new chapters have been opened time after time , while Turkey is moving backwards rather than forwards .
Mr Füle , you have an important opportunity , because you have a broader range of responsibilities , which include enlargement policy and neighbourhood policy .
This will certainly represent a major step forward in the direction of European integration for the entire Western Balkans region .
This year , the report is more critical , and , unfortunately , rightly draws attention to the small amount of progress made by Turkey , especially on questions of citizens &apos; freedoms and the justice system .
In my opinion , the name issue should not come first .
On the subject of Croatia , I would like to say that this country is combating corruption to such an extent that other countries , including some within the EU , should take an example from it .
So , Commissioner , we therefore have to make it clear to our Turkish partners that it is very difficult to speak about Turkey &apos;s European integration until problems related to Turkey &apos;s religious and ethnic minorities are solved .
I do not know if I can do that now - that is what my blue card was based on .
The vote will take place during today &apos;s vote .
I was doing it to ensure you had all the information , but you can read it so I will not read it out .
It is time to stop this imperialism .
In the resolution , it is taken for granted that the elections that brought victory to President Ahmadinejad were fraudulent .
It is probably astronomic in origin and not caused by the alleged greenhouse gases .
A court with a mission is a menace ; a supreme court with a mission is a tyranny .
Parliament and the Commission will cooperate closely at an early stage on any legislative initiative requests emanating from citizens &apos; initiatives .
The automatic exchange of all data on every non @-@ resident in Europe will lead to an unmanageable flood of data .
We must clear the way for financial and logistical tools that will minimise the suffering of those affected by the tragedy , as a matter of urgency , and ensure the rapid restoration of basic living conditions for the people .
I would like to commend the efforts at unity made by the various political groups in Parliament , which have allowed the home of European democracy to speak with one voice and emphasised the strong pragmatic bent of this resolution , which suggests ways , solutions and specific measures for the EU to deal with the Iranian regime .
This is unacceptable , and legal loopholes must not be allowed to facilitate it .
Also , the committee of women adopted an amendment during the debate on the budgetary procedure to launch a multiannual media campaign entitled &apos; Do you know where your child is now &apos; , in close cooperation with civil society organisations , in order to increase awareness in terms of parental responsibility , improve protection for children against all forms of violence and fight trafficking in children more effectively .
It is worrying that the EU , despite having worked out a common position , was not able to use it as a platform for an agreement with other countries .
At a time when millions of people all over the world are suffering from the effects of the crisis , it would be pointless to fight those who do not meet their responsibilities .
in writing . - ( PT ) There is something not right when Parliament demands respect but cannot command it .
The inclusion of provisions relating to &apos; sexual and reproductive rights &apos; is , however , unfortunate in a report which appears within a context of economic crisis and which concerns itself mainly with the impact of this crisis on working conditions for women and the place of women in society .
I call for acknowledgement of the part that each fishing method has played in the alarming situation regarding bluefin tuna , with a new , fairer quota distribution and stricter measures .
I have abstained from voting on the report about Croatia , because the time pressure referred to in the report , in order to make Croatia ready for accession in the first half of 2010 is , in my opinion , not necessary .
On the world stage , the European Union is seen as a paragon of economic development , a multicultural region that encourages respect for minorities and equal rights for all human beings , regardless of gender , race , ethnicity or religion .
True reciprocity would allow the EU authorities to obtain similar data stored in the US and , in the long term , consider the necessity of building up our own EU capacity .
I hope that this answers a few of your questions .
To give some examples in Germany , should Deutsche Telekom , Deutsche Bahn or the Schlecker drug store chain still be worried about collecting information on their employees ?
Instead I call for a complete review of all these anti @-@ terrorism laws .
The fact is that the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council has already made this commitment in a letter to the President of Parliament , but we will still have to uphold it when the time comes to negotiate .
We can accept an exchange , that is to say , a reciprocal transfer , of targeted data on request from a judicial authority in a specific context .
We must develop as well , and body scanners are only one element in this variety .
We cannot adopt this method wholesale , because it involves discrimination , but we must investigate all the possibilities while protecting our fundamental rights .
In comparison , 6 000 people die of AIDS every day .
Ms Flašíková Beňová
There have been significant improvements recently in the European Union in that regard .
The DAA said that , if the Department of Transport gives the go @-@ ahead , which seems very likely , and the equipment proved successful , the scanners could be extended to Cork and Shannon airports .
At the same time , essential sectoral reforms in areas such as energy - in particular the gas sector - transport and the environment need to be undertaken and implemented .
Mrs Ashton has not come , today .
The one real concern I have now is what I heard being discussed on the night : renewed splittist tendencies to break off the Ukrainian west - opposed to Yanukovich and supporters of Tymoshenko - to either join Poland or form a new western state .
The most important thing for the European Union now is to make its presence felt more strongly than before in Ukraine , and to establish new grounds for cooperation .
On all these occasions , we have said that the peaceful practice of religion is a right and that it should never be considered as a threat to the State .
This did not happen by chance , but is a result of strong political will expressed at various G20 summits .
This , of course , is intended to produce a better standard of living .
A variety of high standards are in force in the European Union , for example , in agriculture there are standards for animal welfare .
It was a notion based on moralistic preaching rather than on scientific evidence by the WHO and , thankfully , it was rejected by the Commission .
All of these sectors and many others hope to gain major benefits from the agreement .
In order to encourage Korea to open up its market , European Union entry prices have been eliminated except in the case of the three most sensitive products : tomatoes , oranges and Korean citrus .
You have talked about the Lisbon Strategy , the green economy and innovation .
Also , the European Trade Unions Federation has criticised this free trade agreement .
Is it a qualified majority or a majority by consensus ?
I am glad that they have .
Indeed in some places we have reports of ineffectual follow @-@ up , in other words , even where people do report , nothing very much happens .
The healthcare sector is clearly an important sector ; we have to give it a lot of devotion and attention .
It is best to leave this to the competence of national administrations .
In addition , the gambling industry would have us believe that the gambling market is a normal sector of the internal market and thus need not be subject to restrictions .
I think that what is needed in this balance is clearly set out in both judgments by the Court which , on the one hand , understands and defends the concept of public interest , as safeguarded by national traditions and , on the other hand , formulates objections to disproportionate measures which ultimately work at the expense of the citizen .
It goes right across the entire European Union .
As several of you - including Mr Karas , and Mrs Gebhardt and Mrs Figueiredo a moment ago - have said , this does not concern a service like the others .
Both asked that Parliament grant them extra time , so that they can answer the requests that we personally formulated on the interim agreement .
Therefore , I urge members of the PPE Group to let us take this urgency session a little more seriously , or it will no doubt end up being completely pointless .
In my opinion , we should be given an answer to a fundamental question : the stations which were closed down - were they all closed down for political reasons , or were some of them closed down because , in fact , they did not meet legal requirements ?
The international community , however , has been sparing in its efforts , refusing to recognise that this is in fact a coup d &apos;état and that the government put in place by Andry Rajoelina in Madagascar is in fact a military government .
The reduction in funds which are destined for this area and for these refugees is of great concern .
I am also sure that we should not outsource our task of reminding Myanmar of its obligations to neighbouring countries .
Three small things , but which will , together and over time , have the potential to make a significant difference .
I am talking about sustainable growth , recognising the importance of tackling climate change , recognising the pressure on resources .
At the same time , the European Commission and Eurostat are saying that they did not receive all the necessary information .
The question that I want to ask and that we are all going to ask is : who are you ?
Indeed , Mr Daul , Member States will have to abandon more of their sovereignty , in particular in the fiscal area .
In my opinion , in addition to a well @-@ functioning energy supply and infrastructure , this will require well @-@ trained workers and not wave after wave of migrant workers flooding the labour market with cheap labour .
I think this is fundamental , and it is a substantial change from the Lisbon Strategy .
What it has asked for and is asking for is political support .
If necessary , there is , of course , an element of solidarity .
On the one hand , solidarity among Member States which guarantees that no Member State will be left behind in the crisis .
Mr President , whilst the Commission is very keen on defending our human rights , we British have known since the thirteenth century exactly where we have stood .
In many cases where the government of a country has long failed to participate in dialogue or programmes to improve the situation in question , country @-@ specific resolutions represent the only remaining action that the international community can take against these crimes .
The Goldstone report , this brave report that simply demands that justice be done , is that too much to ask ?
It represents the highest aspirations for all of us on this planet and deserves all of our support .
The European Union must therefore make clear its determination to refer the matter to the International Criminal Court if nothing is done , in line with the recommendation made in the Goldstone report .
Mr President , can I ask Mr Kelly , and I am sure he will be glad to do so , to clarify .
He is clearly a president who is looking more to Moscow than to Brussels .
( PL ) Mr President , I listened with great attention to what was said by the Commissioner , Mrs Georgieva , and would like to say that I expect behaviour which is a little more energetic .
In this respect , I am very happy to see Commissioner Reding here , who is responsible for implementing everything relating to equality between men and women from a judicial point of view .
This is the new rising phenomenon and a serious one which has to be closely looked at and properly addressed .
There is still a lack of sufficiently reliable and comparable data both at national and EU level determining social indicators , including the poverty of women , violence against women and institutional mechanisms .
I have received one motion for a resolutionto wind up the debate in accordance with Rule 115 ( 5 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
It is time international organisations , including our own European Parliament , took up the matter of discrimination against Poles in Lithuania .
As a result , air fares are higher , hindering the mobility of people and limiting the area &apos;s attractiveness to tourists , which would allow their enormous potential for development and for diversifying their economic base to flourish and become stronger .
Yesterday , my colleague , Johannes Hahn , as the competent Member of the Commission , was able to talk to the President of the Autonomous Region of Madeira , Mr Jardim , who said that the situation remains serious .
( EL ) Mr President , I , too , express my deepest regret at the biblical disaster which has hit Madeira and my undivided support for the Portuguese Government .
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is giving the European Union more competence in the field of energy policy .
The energy systems of the EU Member States are neither sufficiently compatible nor sufficiently interlinked .
The second reason is that , since the EU has a shortage of energy products and internal demand - like imports - is growing every day , EU energy policy must focus on diversification , security of supply and energy efficiency .
One paragraph , however , is a point of principle ; it concerns the decision that was made 20 years ago now that Parliament should not take more than 20 % of the EU &apos;s administrative budget .
( ES ) Mr President , yesterday , because of the time it took to get through our work here in the House , there was no opportunity to mention the recent death of Orlando Zapata , which the Spanish delegation sincerely laments .
We must tackle the situation head on and maintain the balance of the state , of the European Union and of the world .
We have succeeded in incorporating important social democratic concerns into the report .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the report and our coordinator for doing such an efficient job .
They have a piece of paper that they can hold up to their families and their communities which demonstrates that their hard work of today is not damaging the prospects of fish stocks &apos; survival in the future .
As Mr Cadec said , it must be incontestable , it must be objective and it must be up to date .
The main building blocks of the reform of the fisheries policy , as proposed by the Commission in its Green Paper , must be making the ecosystem the starting point , and the precautionary principle .
I have to be honest with you : I am shocked that some people have accused us of neglecting safety .
What added value have they brought ?
It is clear , therefore , that we in Europe are not ready for this and that therefore our trains will be unable , or insufficiently able , to communicate with these new signalling installations .
A split vote must be held on this central part , because I do not understand why we are combining these things and not making it clear that we must combat discrimination against religious minorities just as vigorously as all other types of discrimination . It is not acceptable for the measures to combat discrimination against religious minorities to be less strict .
Mr President , that is another dose of the medicine that caused the illness in the first place .
I voted in favour of the report on investment in energy infrastructure , which is aimed at ensuring energy supply and competitive potential , and strengthening the fight against climate change .
We must encourage Ukraine to actively participate in the Eastern Partnership and support its efforts to ensure more democracy and respect for the rule of law , human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as the commitment to safeguard the market economy , sustainable development and good governance .
A key point is that it is essential to strengthen cooperation between Ukraine and the EU , especially in the area of energy .
Although significant progress has been made in terms of achieving the objectives of the Beijing Platform for Action , adopted in 1995 , gender inequality and stereotypes persist .
Lastly , I believe that the sum of EUR 1 500 as a monthly allocation for Members &apos; assistants seems inadequate , since the minimum threshold for the appointment of a new level I @-@ accredited assistant is EUR 1 649 .
This policy , the only criterion for which is the profitability of capital , is resulting in the destruction of the marine environment and of ecosystems .
This concerns the basis for quota allocation .
Since the majority of citizens are against these genetically modified organisms , we have a duty to hold a debate this week on this licensing and the offensive that is perhaps still trundling towards us .
Much has been achieved , much can be celebrated , but there is very much more to do .
I must point out that the new system is not targeted at Russia .
I request that the Commission takes the necessary steps to ensure that Community law continues to prevail without fail .
The implementation of this law will be positive in areas devastated by urban development .
I would like , once more , to express my thanks to everyone from the three institutions - the Parliament , the Council and the Commission - who worked unremittingly on this dossier .
That was an uphill struggle , but it was worth it .
In light of the different situations regarding rabies in Member States , the Commission chose a safe , precautionary approach .
We want mobility and freedom of movement for people and we have considered how we can ensure that .
In addition , there are relatively new phenomena such as the emergence of the low @-@ cost air carriers and the growth of the cruise industry .
Mr President , many colleagues have pointed out the necessity of having this review , and the sooner the better .
More generally , it is important to underline the consequences of implementing this tax in the European Union alone , as some people are advocating , if no agreement were possible at international level .
Let us be clear . Saying this is saying to people that the Tobin Tax will never exist on a global scale .
What we want is for speculators to make their contribution to the risk and to overcoming the risk .
Double taxation must also be avoided , as well as the creation of obstacles blocking the free movement of capital .
My staff are currently analysing various options and their analyses should be finished next spring .
Back in 2007 , the Romanian Banking Association , a member of the European Payments Council , took on the role of support organisation for joining the SEPA schemes .
Thirdly , we would end up with a uniform directive for all Member States , a stronger internal market and genuine administrative simplification .
Unfortunately , in Europe , we are seeing the closure of many of these small enterprises , and this is why we should not be making assessments ; this is why we should act .
First of all , I would suggest that Parliament must support Mr Lehne &apos;s proposal and that you take into account what has just been said about modifying other directives .
rapporteur . - Mr President , Commissioners , dear colleagues - also those who are leaving the room right now - this report was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs ( ECON ) and it is the fruit of a joint effort of all political groups .
That is why we support it and I congratulate the rapporteur on the result achieved .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I think it is very important that we should stand shoulder to shoulder with my colleague , Mr Dalli , to reply to your questions and to tell you about the implementation of these various tools and texts .
We therefore reject this concept , because it is the wrong one .
Moreover , parents also have control over their children &apos;s consumption , especially when they are young .
It is clearly important here to have a cross @-@ border element and I hope that both Commissioners will contribute towards opening up the cross @-@ border consumer market and especially towards breaking down barriers in the form of various national exemptions , and that we will thereby achieve full harmonisation of the consumer market .
I would also suggest that , since many of the problems are local , there could be a local aspect to this to deal with inquiries at an early stage .
Mr President , I will conclude by mentioning three specific points .
These systems still do not function properly and cannot be relied on in all Member States .
It will also very much correspond to the philosophy of a Europe without internal borders .
We would point out to the Commission and the Council the security problems that may arise from this free movement .
The EU is rich in bogus colleges , and even genuine colleges frequently have students on their books who never appear in a lecture room .
It must be said , of course , that the inconsistency of allowing some states to have a transitional period is something we must eliminate in the future and that it is essential for us to act jointly and to have harmonised legislation .
This instance involved responding to a request for assistance by Germany as a result of redundancies in the car industry , within the Karmann Group .
It is estimated that these sectors can create around 2 million jobs across Europe by 2020 .
I voted in favour of the present report as I consider it essential to strengthen European consumer protection policy and to render it more effective and meaningful for the public .
However , this has been going on for several years now and we are still unable to create an ideal mechanism and tighten the compulsory conditions by fulfilling these tasks at national level .
We have very high standards of animal health requirements in Ireland and , as a result , I voted in favour of this important report , which will protect the health status of Irish animals .
I voted for this regulation because I consider that it is a welcome improvement to a previous measure which restricted the rights of long @-@ stay visa holders in a Member State .
The creation of a stable and innovative internal market which caters for the needs of consumers and in which firms can maximise the creation of new jobs cannot coexist with systematic delays in the implementation of Community legislation and failure to apply directives .
To fulfil its mission , the service has to find its rightful place in the architecture of the European Union , under the leadership of the High Representative who , as VicePresident of the Commission , is fully accountable to this Parliament and who is responsible for coordinating the other aspects of the Union &apos;s external action within the Commission .
At the same time , several Member States are calling for a European monetary fund or even economic governance .
Acting under pressure , we invested huge sums in vaccines , which , as we now know , was irrational and unjustified .
Your question , distinguished Member of Parliament , comes from an assumption that is not correct , namely that it is because Greece is in the euro area that it is having some problems .
( Applause )
What is going on in Delhi ?
I also have a question concerning the Kyoto Protocol . One strategic error we made in Bangkok was to give the impression that we would abandon it .
There are a lot of factors to take into account - &apos; What do we think ?
The first is dissatisfaction with the current situation of most Roma in the European Union .
Additionally , the Fundamental Rights Agency &apos;s discrimination survey found that the Roma were discriminated against more than any other group surveyed .
Important steps have been taken by the European Parliament by passing a resolution on the necessity of the Roma strategy .
As a former Secretary of State , I have to say that results were achieved in regions where there were local majority leaders committed to the issue , and credible local minority leaders capable of motivating the minority and supported by NGOs .
I have heard many of you speaking about schooling . I am looking forward to seeing the details of our action on pre @-@ schooling , how this has been working out .
However , Commissioner , I would also like to ask whether you can say why , in the EU 2020 strategy , the European Commission has devoted so little attention to the security and stability of pensions and to pension guarantees , since we have to take into account the current situation in the labour market , the current demographic situation and , indeed , this is one of the most important issues , what sort of pensions people will receive in 10 years time .
Social protection measures in the Member States have cut the risk of poverty facing the EU population by 32 % .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for her response .
As is all too often the case when rail accidents happen , remarks alleging a link between European rules or regulations and the accidents have been made .
In order to raise awareness of the value of volunteering throughout the EU , would the Commission consider , in conjunction with the proposed initiatives to celebrate the European Year on Volunteering , drawing up a comprehensive Green Paper on volunteering to facilitate , recognise and add value to volunteering ?
For me , in order to correctly assess liberalisation , it is important that we quickly carry out implementation or enforce it using the means available to the Commission or means that it still needs to grant itself .
If only one or two Member States had not introduced this first package , we would be able to impose sanctions today and fulminate in this Chamber , but if twenty @-@ something Member States have not introduced this package , then perhaps the package - to put it mildly - is not the best .
This results in high access prices and , as a consequence , restricts the competitiveness of this branch of the transportation industry because of the high costs of transport .
The final agreement will only be binding on those countries that have signed , although we would of course be happy if more countries , and especially emerging economies , could subsequently join .
They are furious at the complete lack of transparency .
As the Commission , you are the guardian of the treaties .
What we do by way of information goes far beyond what is mentioned in Article 218 , far beyond , but I have no problem with that .
In the second case , we have a country that has to combat terrible internal guerrilla warfare and where there have been serious human rights violations , including the frequent killings of trade unionists .
The new list of beneficiary countries must reflect the real economic standing and competitiveness of developing countries .
The European Union must make its presence felt with the international organisations to which it is allied , especially the United Nations , the chief custodian of global security .
If we pull together , we can safeguard our interests .
We should make no mistake : the entire treaty @-@ based non @-@ proliferation system with the NPT as a cornerstone is under growing pressure .
No , neither terrorism nor organised crime should be military targets .
Baroness Ashton , I would like to thank you for travelling to Kiev to talk to President Yanukovich .
In my opinion , the very way in which this was rejected also demonstrates a serious lack of respect .
Parliament would expect the new institution , like others , to be linked with us by an interinstitutional agreement clearly setting out the rules of cooperation .
Here is the very important leadership role - yours , Baroness Ashton .
Dwindling defence budgets and the current economic crisis make it patently clear that if we want Europe to speak with a single voice in the world and send out strong signals commanding respect , we must use the available resources more prudently and efficiently .
That is particularly true , as a number of honourable Members have said , in Kosovo , where I have met the government .
NATO could not have intervened to put a stop to the conflict in Georgia , where there is no UN or OSCE presence .
Mr President , I should like to table an oral amendment to this amendment , deleting two parts of the amendment , namely the words &apos; by the Colombian army &apos; and &apos; on Colombia &apos; .
( EL ) Mr President , I voted against the report , because the EU 2020 strategy treads the same unsuccessful neoliberal path as the Lisbon Strategy , which widened regional and social inequalities , increased poverty and unemployment and was the basic cause of the crisis in the European Union .
It is , at the same time , an initiative to defend the fundamental principles of democracy and tolerance , which are the foundation of Europe .
Negotiations are taking place in secret , behind closed doors , without properly informing the European Parliament and Members , who should , in the end , approve this document .
It is , therefore , with some reservations that I am voting in favour of the present report .
These are , in fact , areas which are fundamental if Europe is to overcome the crisis and reaffirm its role as an important player in the global market , with a high level of development and a competitive economy which is capable of generating wealth , employment and innovation .
It must also take account of the negotiations ahead of it in the areas of energy , climate change , industry and agriculture .
Attention must be paid to the armed conflict that started in Gaza on 27 December 2008 and ended on 18 January 2009 , causing the death of over 1 400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis .
Leaving aside the fact that there was not enough time to debate the report , we were not given a presentation of the report which included comprehensive coverage of the opposing arguments .
It is clear that the time has come for radical action to ensure the financial sector pays its way in the wake of the crisis and an FTT could be an important tool .
The Commission should submit proposals before the next round of negotiations .
Parliament plays a fundamental role here as a guardian of the democratic legitimacy of external action .
On the one hand , the report seeks to strengthen the EU &apos;s autonomy in respect of other global players , in particular , in respect of the United States , through having a strong foreign , security and defence policy , and this is something that I welcome .
The next item is the statement by the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy regarding the EU &apos;s Arctic policy .
I hope that the High Representative will insist on permanent observer status for the EU at the next ministerial meeting in April next year in Greenland .
Neither the US , Canada , Greenland nor Russia have expressed a wish to become a member of the EU .
In this matter , the question posed by Mrs Ashton would appear to be very appropriate - how can the European Union be a responsible player in the area of problems connected with the Arctic ?
I believe , too , that the Arctic Council has much to contribute .
Let it never again be said that European democratic law yields to the orders - in inverted commas - of Yankee imperialism .
The European Union must do everything within its power to help improve the human rights situation in Cuba .
It is an obstacle to the European Union implementing the principles that are behind its external action , which include promoting democracy and human rights in the world .
We had , on the one hand , the bad Cubans who were vassals of the Soviet Union intent on pursuing international revolution and , on the other hand , the good Cubans , who rescued the country from the grip of the sugar barons , the mafia , the CIA and US imperialism .
We need to support these conversations , these negotiations , which are basically conducted by the Commission .
The governments that I mentioned a moment ago are interested in developing this strategy , and we need to wait for the Commission to publish its communication .
Your Spanish is impressive , Mr Hannan .
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
That is the option chosen by Russia , Japan and France .
In fact , we know that any form of addiction is an unwelcome phenomenon that must be eradicated .
One potential and very important source for Central European and Baltic States would be the use of the emission credits accumulated under the Kyoto Protocol &apos;s emissions trading system , thereby profiting from these countries &apos; climate resources .
We must therefore establish the funding requirements in this area , with the aim of increasing the European Union &apos;s competitiveness globally .
The Commission &apos;s condolences go in particular to the families and friends of those that have lost their lives .
They shoulder a great deal of responsibility for virtually nothing , they have a remarkable sense of the general interest , they are coping with ever more complex duties , for which Europe is partly responsible , and they have also been completely abandoned by the public authorities , and I was anxious to point this out here .
I think that measures specifically aimed at this can be included for every macro @-@ region in Europe .
Four are working in the earthquake zone near Concepción , while two are currently based in Santiago to liaise with authorities and coordinate the response of European Union Member States .
The statistics are there .
- Mr President , who would have thought 20 years ago , when the air of Europe was thick with the brick dust of falling walls and with cries of freedom , that the red flag would still today be flying over Havana and that Fidel Castro would be dying peacefully in bed on that sultry Caribbean island .
Irrespective of that , however , it is important for the EU and also the United States to apply the same standards everywhere .
I appeal to the good will of the European Commission as regards negotiating the revision of the regional operational programmes INTERVIR + ( ERDF ) and RUMOS ( ESF ) , as well as the section on Madeira of the Thematic Territorial Enhancement Operational Programme ( Cohesion Fund ) .
In the cut and thrust of political debate we must never lose sight of the suffering of both Israeli and Palestinian families whose loved ones have been taken from them in this conflict .
Shalit &apos;s case should not become a bargaining chip .
The NGOs are producing ever more reports and talking about crimes of state .
The Commission is of course highly concerned at this situation .
This being so , by applying the death penalty we are , in fact , saving the lives of innocent people .
I think that we are dealing with an extremely serious case of someone being excluded on ideological grounds from the position of expert in one of the European Parliament &apos;s committees ...
I hope that the European leaders will be present and say &apos; yes &apos; when it comes to responding to these challenges in a collective spirit .
We are in a position to resolve the problem within the euro area ourselves .
We have a wonderful climate , our land is our asset , our forests burned as have the forests in California , they have held Olympic Games , as have we , and we have ended up with the same problems as California .
The risk of state bankruptcy has not been eliminated , but despite the weekly meetings and summits of leaders and finance ministers , a clear solution has not yet been put in place .
They are decided in advance by the political elite and governments of the Member States of the European Union .
Will the European Council stop it by creating an effective European preventive mechanism which will safeguard the national economies and the stability of the euro area ?
( SK ) I will be very brief , because most of the issues have already been mentioned , of course .
The economic and financial crisis , and Greece , require European action .
There was the debate , a while ago , on whether one cancels out the other and whether it is a zero @-@ sum game .
The low turn @-@ out at the EU elections speaks volumes .
While we need to squeeze every possibility out of this legislation , we must not promise more than we can deliver .
Generally speaking , it is a fact that democracy is today taking a backwards step .
It is an appeal to citizens , because European civic identity develops when it is put into practice ; not simply when a right is obtained , but when that right is put into practice and exercised .
Finally , President Obama recently met with the Dalai Lama in the White House .
It is not enough to formulate criticisms .
We are likewise unable to put pressure on China through millions in development aid .
This is a disturbing phenomenon , because we know that if there is no freedom of speech , and if journalists are not able to work , there is no freedom at all , and there is no democracy .
In the work of this service , consideration must be given to the cultural and national differentiation which exists within the Union .
This will , at the same time , increase the level of social integration and the flow of knowledge , and will make it possible for the citizens of the European Union to be truly mobile .
Especially during a crisis , we should remember this aspect of EU policy , particularly the solidarity aspect , so as not to perpetuate the division of the continent into poor and rich parts .
At this economically difficult time , the Union must first realise that its financial resources come from Member States , who face having to make drastic cutbacks .
The time has come for decisions about spending money from EU coffers to be made jointly .
Investing in young people is an investment not only in what will happen one day , but is about what is happening here and now .
It is my belief that our quality system can be a good ambassador for our agri @-@ food model , and even for our common agricultural policy .
I feel it would be largely meaningless and would not be helpful to consumers .
Today , however , Community legislation restricts compulsory labelling of the place of production to just certain products , thereby vouchsafing them special treatment and leaving out agricultural products of major nutritional value and priority for consumers .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen .
We are balancing the books but our workers are paying the price .
We had believed that our successes in past decades had eliminated the threats related to this serious public health concern .
There is less foreign investment and little access by these countries to international funding , and we are seeing a growing protectionist reaction from the developed countries .
Opening of the sitting
I would like to say that the robustness of euro @-@ denominated CDS markets is of direct relevance for the Eurosystem as regards control over its currency and financial stability in the euro area .
The euro , a stable common currency , has played the part of a real monetary shield .
Hence , it is now in a strong position for recovery .
Spending and arms need to be controlled , as does everything that has increased significantly over the last two years , but especially incomes , which have decreased equally significantly .
It is worth repeating that the euro has been a success during the financial crisis and it has been an anchor in Europe , including for countries outside the euro area .
( SK ) The report on the annual management of the euro area and of public finances in 2009 analyses in detail the management of the EU during the global financial and economic crisis .
In 2009 , monetary instability could have weakened the political solidity of the European Union .
( RO ) We have been able to observe during this crisis that the fluctuations triggered by interest and exchange rates have come up against a single currency which has properly shielded the euro area .
I would like to stress that there is a major problem , and I refer to what I learnt during my visit to Greece last week .
We would like the words &apos; the Council and &apos; to be deleted . The final result of the amendment which is currently under discussion would then be :
If we just lay down new quotas and muzzling laws and if we just turn on the money tap again , everything will be fine .
I , and the vast majority of my constituents in Northern Ireland , remain firm in the belief of the right to life of the unborn child .
There are many motivations to this but , principally , Christian ethics compel me to care about bettering the existence not only of people , but also of animals and our natural environment .
The Irish Labour Party does not support the introduction of CCCTB .
Secondly , productive work when performing her own personal duties , duties at the Group / Chamber level and those as a member of the college of the European Court of Auditors .
I voted for this resolution since Europe &apos;s Roma continue to suffer great discrimination and , in many cases , experience immense poverty and social isolation .
The need of the hour is to renew that proposal .
Although they have been grouped together under the so @-@ called new &apos; 2020 strategy &apos; , these are old guidelines .
I voted in favour of the report entitled &apos; Agricultural product quality policy : what strategy to follow ? &apos; because quality is a decisive factor in the competitiveness of European products in international markets .
Consumers have a right to accurate and clear information on the content and origin of goods and regarding whether or not they have been genetically modified .
Ultimately , we have to tackle the root of the problem and impose strict regulations on the financial markets , prevent speculative practices and quickly introduce a tax on financial transactions .
Adjournment of the session
It will be the result of our efforts , not an instrument .
Now , as the immediate impact of the financial crisis fades , the G20 faces the challenge of keeping up its momentum for a joint approach to the policy issues that need to be addressed if the world wants to come out of the crisis in a better shape .
Greece has to take the measures which are necessary , but not with bilateral loans .
I consider that to be a scandal in this , the European Year for Combating Poverty .
We have decided on social inclusion and , amongst other things , the fight against poverty .
Finally , on the role of Parliament : consulting is not enough .
On the contrary , we are hearing pleas for a rush ahead , including the establishment of a European Monetary Fund and an even more federal Europe .
As regards the substantive parts , it is to be welcomed that the Council seeks to promulgate the directives on employment and the economy in a closer reciprocal relationship , but as I say , if this is to happen , we should be able to start working with the Council .
Because they have paid money into the International Monetary Fund in recent times so that it can actually fulfil its task of providing timely financial assistance .
Not long ago , it came to light that the quotas sold by the Hungarian Government found their way unlawfully back into the EU &apos;s emission trading system .
Written Declaration number 0071 / 2009 , submitted by Members Elizabeth Lynne , Michail Tremopoulos , Lívia Járóka and Lidia Joanna Geringer de Oedenberg , on the fight against breast cancer in the European Union , has been signed by over half of Parliament &apos;s Members .
One @-@ minute speeches on matters of political importance
Last time the leaders of Europe backed away from the social challenges of difficult economic times , this continent sank into the depths of hatred and totalitarianism .
We will not accept it because we wish to exercise our rights fully , and I think that European democracy will increase as a result .
As far as whether our rights have been expanded or reduced , ladies and gentlemen , please read the report and look at the legislation .
When it comes to capacity @-@ building assistance for third countries , and certainly in the poorest countries , the European Union could provide much more help and know @-@ how and ensure that the aviation authorities also have the necessary capacity to resolve the issues they have .
Firstly , international aspects : the Commission works in directions such as making every possible effort to strengthen international cooperation with third countries by encouraging States to join the safety assessment of a foreign aircraft programme which encompasses all the 40 states in Europe , but also through technical assistance projects to achieve the worldwide standards .
We will now go on with the debate and also devote our full attention to it .
Our duty , Commissioner , is therefore to define clear and transparent rules - rules which will eliminate the current anarchy in this sector and prevent operators in future from exploiting mandatory measures for the protection of passengers in order to make unjustified profits .
From the start , we have been very willing to compromise .
We also need to work in a cost @-@ effective , environmentally sound and environmentally friendly way . This will be particularly important in future .
On @-@ shore employment , in banks , shipyards , insurance companies , logistics companies , training and education institutions and in companies actively working on innovations and improvements to the fleets &apos; environmental performance , would be dealt an insurmountable blow if our fleet were to leave us .
Risk @-@ based controls alone are not sufficient .
The first is piracy , on which the recommendations are all good , but inevitably general .
Therefore , what I want to achieve from a political point of view is , on the one hand , quick and effective digitisation while , at the same time , retaining copyright , because that is the only way that we will be able to maintain the cultural diversity of the European Union .
This practice obviously produces numerous mistakes in the content posted there .
Mr President , Commissioner , the report I am presenting to Parliament sets out to explain that the agricultural sector has a place and a role to play in the fight against global warming .
We need , on the one hand , to further help EU agriculture to contribute to mitigating climate change by reducing its own greenhouse gas emissions , enhancing CO2 sequestration in soils and making use of renewable energies from other sources and , on the other , to be more productive , to be more efficient at providing food supplies , in this way demonstrating that one can achieve both goals : food security on the one side , environmental sustainability on the other side .
Compensating farmers in areas where production is not hampered by natural handicaps and where there is no additional cost or income forgone would distort competition with farmers in other areas .
I would like to give just one proof of this : the Stoiber Group , which advises the Commission on the topic of administrative burden , has clearly indicated that the level of red tape for farmers has been reduced considerably as a result of simplification activities carried out by the Commission .
Therefore , Mr President , a decision has been made that means giving a European perspective and a coordinated European approach to what is happening , based on safety and the need to be as effective and precise as possible when making a decision on flights , while protecting citizens &apos; rights .
We are privileged Members of the European Parliament , who can make use of the available infrastructure .
Therefore , for the future , we will need to take account of safety requirements in the first instance , but also of requirements which , while reconciled precisely with safety , involve not just an indiscriminate ban on flights , but measures that reflect the real situation , not the statistical situation , so that , for the sake of a sector that is vital to the whole economy , we may prevent a repeat of the negative economic consequences and repercussions that we saw when the attack of 11 September 2001 took place , not only for the air transport sector and the tourism sector , but for the economy as a whole .
Finally , Mr President , if you will allow me , in order to dispel any suspicion that may exist , I should like to propose that a European Parliament committee of inquiry be set up on this matter .
We must deal with this from the centre .
In Europe , air traffic has been reduced by 70 % , and 80 % of airports have been closed .
If one thing is clear , it is that our society is extremely vulnerable to crises of this kind .
One other matter , which is not such a big issue : many colleagues and the press have said we were too late and were not prepared .
We have had to curtail the subject somewhat , because of the change to the order of business , and after listening to what Mr Barroso has to say , we will hear speeches from the chairs of the political groups , who will give a political opinion on what the Commission is proposing for 2010 .
It is realistic if all institutions are ready to join forces and cooperate with a view to delivering timely results to Europe &apos;s citizens ; it is necessary because business as usual is not an option if we want 2010 to mark a turning point ; and it is ambitious because , more than ever , a strong Europe is required to deliver to citizens the solutions they are looking for .
I also believe that we need far @-@ reaching projects .
However , even if I were in favour of it , I would accuse its masters of betraying the economic interests of its peoples .
Therefore , I would like to ask the Commission how Europe will create new jobs ?
I will also commit to regulatory monitors for the construction process through regular visits and to speed up aid delivery .
Mr President , commissioners , Haiti has demonstrated that poverty severely aggravates the damage done by natural disasters , and also that a lack of governability hinders the possibility of an effective response .
We had to deal with this in the issue of food delivery where the government of Haiti suggested that we shift away from food provision to only cash @-@ for @-@ work and food @-@ for @-@ work , which is highly desirable but cannot be done everywhere at the same time .
It is a coordination of loans .
We do not want to undermine what is a very important sector in our economies - the financial sector - but we believe that some more measures are important to restore confidence in the financial sector .
I believe that the development of this strategy will enable us to achieve significant results in the fight against unemployment .
In my view , this is not specific enough . You should provide examples .
As the report rightly points out , the partnership has been a success .
( FR ) Madam President , Mr Salafranca Sánchez @-@ Neyra &apos;s report contains many interesting things .
These high standards result in higher production costs for European farmers and producers and these can be disadvantageous in the market due to the importation of products of lower quality and at lower cost .
The debate is closed .
I think that was both sensible and useful .
Many weapons are in circulation in Kyrgyzstan , a small country with just 5.3 million inhabitants , and the only country in the world to house both a US and a Russian military base .
It will offer us an excellent opportunity to provide support at the highest political level to reach an ambitious comprehensive economic and trade agreement as soon as possible .
The European public sector workers &apos; trade unions are also concerned , and I call on both Canadian and EU @-@ based unions to forge a real campaign to protect public ownership in public services with democratic control rather than maximisation of private profit , but not just a coming together at leadership level but a real involvement of the rank and file to protect their public services .
It is a lucky coincidence that Joe Biden is speaking in the European Parliament in Brussels on the same day as the EU @-@ Canada Summit is taking place , because effective , professional cooperation with both parts of the North American continent is important to us and because together , we want to take more responsibility in the world .
The vote will take place during the first part @-@ session in May .
Can I thank the Commissioner for the reply .
You can always ask the staff of Joaquín Almunia to give you guidance , so do not hesitate when there is any uncertainty .
Do you consider that measures need to be taken in respect of the budget situation in Cyprus and , if so , what measures and for how long ?
The Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Policy , Mr Olli Rehn , said that the key lesson of the crisis is that we urgently need broader and deeper monitoring of economic policies , including action to promptly identify and address imbalances , with a view to safeguarding macro @-@ economic stability in the eurozone .
However , we must recognise that this matter leaves a slightly bitter taste in the mouth .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , I am grateful for the strong support for creating this agency by a majority of this plenary .
If I had to pick out only certain aspects of this important text , I would say that it gives us greater flexibility and solidarity in Europe .
To conclude , we could also show some solidarity .
It has been drafted on the basis of some excellent , welcome proposals from the Commission intended to simplify the application procedure enabling Member States to access the relevant funds .
As I was saying , all types of production are currently being hit by a price fall and a deep crisis in the markets .
We must not regard export subsidies and interventions as the normal rules for influencing the market in future .
I am firmly convinced and conscious of the fact that market management mechanisms must be able to play a role alongside direct aid , which we must keep , albeit by adapting the criteria for awarding them .
the report by Mrs Mathieu , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European GNSS Supervisory Authority for the financial year 2008 ( SEC ( 2009 ) 1089 - C7 @-@ 0200 / 2009 - ,
I would invite that person to approach the competent committees and join us in discussing ways of reducing the risks of misappropriation in this House .
On this point , I expect the swift conclusions of the interinstitutional working group to ensure that the same problems are not repeated year after year .
On the other hand , we are concerned at the low uptake of payment appropriations for transport safety , the even lower uptake for the Marco Polo programme , which enjoys Parliament &apos;s support , and also the exceptionally low uptake of appropriations for passenger rights .
We are convinced that the independence of the European Parliament &apos;s groups is inseparable from their financial responsibility .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , the discharge is one of the most important acts that we are responsible for .
We share his criticism and that of the other groups .
I therefore propose adding the following phrase to this paragraph : as it is the fact in the S &amp; D Group .
( NL ) Mr President , a great deal has already been said in this debate , and so I should like to confine myself to two points .
In our general audit strategy , we pay great attention to the improvement of auditing in terms of also auditing the efficiency of EU spending .
As for exchanging data with third countries , our understanding is that , when the US authorities have grounds to think that there are data that may help authorities in other countries to prosecute terrorist crimes , such data should be used .
Furthermore , I would like to underline , like my colleagues did , that the principles of proportionalities and necessity are key to the envisaged agreement .
Recent progress is , I think , a tribute to what can be achieved when partners treat each other with respect and listen to each other , treat objections seriously and try hard to bring views together .
We are discussing this problem at a time when the fate of the negotiating mandate in talks with the United States is in the balance .
The exception to this , of course , is situations where other extremely serious activities are associated with terrorism , such as drug trafficking and espionage .
The Americans have shown a very open attitude so far .
I know from conversations I have had that it is of course possible - if you want to - to create personality profiles from these pieces of data .
The problems in European aviation over recent days have demonstrated once more the essential role played by passenger and freight transport in the organisation of today &apos;s society .
I think that is a false dilemma .
For all these reasons , the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament , together with the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , are not only launching the initiative but are also asking the Commission to draw up legislation by 2010 or 2011 definitively banning the use of cyanide in mining within the European Union , because environmental pollution does not stop at national borders .
In fact , the Commission tightened up the regulations as a result of the unfortunate accident which occurred in 2000 .
When using any chemical substance , all the technologies and regulations for protecting the environment which apply in 2010 must be observed .
Firstly , the vote on the report by Vital Moreira on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing macro @-@ economic financial assistance to Ukraine has been postponed to the second part @-@ session in May .
For that reason , we discussed this once again this morning in our group and it was said that , if there is an opportunity for the open questions to be answered to Parliament &apos;s satisfaction , we ought to take that opportunity .
A common system of value added tax ( VAT ) as regards the rules on invoicing is essential to the simplification , modernisation and harmonisation of the rules on VAT invoicing .
The Court of Auditors stated in its report that the annual accounts of the European Aviation Safety Agency for the financial year 2008 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
Lastly , it is important to highlight that the Foundation &apos;s work in supporting the Commission in 2008 obtained a 97 % satisfaction rate from the Commission .
For the above reasons , I voted for this resolution , in which the committee is invited to adopt the report without additional amendments and mandate the rapporteur to enter into negotiations with the Council on this basis .
This decision is important because it gives guidelines on the objectives , the priorities and the major actions to be taken in the area of the trans @-@ European transport network .
Moreover , the instruments need to be made more flexible , because rigid instruments that cannot adapt to unforeseen circumstances , such as a crisis , are damaging to the European Union &apos;s economic development .
Nevertheless , this detailing of the law set out in the Treaty is important to prevent excessively disparate interpretations that would jeopardise the consistency of EU law .
&apos;Europeana &apos; , the European digital library , is a single , direct , multilingual portal designed for Europe &apos;s cultural heritage .
To make this possible , it is necessary to increase funding for the digitisation of cultural products , while ensuring close cooperation between rights @-@ holders , cultural institutions and the public and private sector .
The Member States and the regions must have the opportunity to implement more far @-@ reaching animal welfare legislation .
This follows on from what took place yesterday in the European Parliament , where 1 500 elected officials from major European towns committed themselves to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20 % by 2020 .
I also wish to point out that I feel that it is appropriate to include in the Commission &apos;s future proposal flexible rules which also allow aid to be granted to farmers in zones with natural handicaps with a small area , located from an administrative perspective in units which do not meet the established criteria .
Increased attention needs to be focused on defining a new digital agenda , 2015.eu , which is intended to be more competitive and innovative than the i2010 strategy launched recently , especially with regard to its educational and cultural aspects .
I note that the rapporteur expresses his concern at the continuing cases of petty crime on Parliament &apos;s premises , requesting as a result that the Secretary @-@ General pay special attention to this matter in order to reduce petty crime .
The determination to promote relations with Latin American countries could pave the way to resolving the whole issue of European investors &apos; rights , in an appropriate manner .
This may be the reason why Canada has done this , but , as I see it , there is no reason whatsoever for us as Europeans to support it or even mention it in an EU text .
The renegotiation of this agreement with the United States is a unique opportunity for the EU to make an effective contribution to discovering new terrorists and potential attacks .
Cyanide is an extremely dangerous chemical used by the mining industry , despite the risks that it poses to the environment and human health .
the report by Mr Méndez de Vigo on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the recommendation on the European Council &apos;s proposal not to convene a Convention for the revision of the Treaties with regard to transitional measures concerning the composition of the European Parliament &#91; 17196 / 2009 - C7 @-@ 0002 / 2010 - 2009 / 0814 ( NLE ) &#93; .
A proposal is on the table that could put us in a situation in which , in the next four years , things can be adopted in this Parliament by people who have not been democratically elected , but rather appointed .
Once again , the rapporteur has been able to compile what were at times differing opinions and contributions and to summarise them - I would say - in an extremely balanced text .
Clear steps forward have been taken .
That is why in 2008 the Commission quickly put forward new legislation for these agencies , which will come into force in the next few months .
We needed five months to put a mechanism in place : three months to decide on its principle , then two months to decide on its conditions .
We must also rewrite the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact .
It is about not returning to a crisis that has not yet completely come to an end , and it is above all about doing so by establishing a strategy for growth , a model for growth that is adapted to the new times .
You talk of coordination of economic policy , but a major problem is that all of this has been interpreted too much as a free @-@ for @-@ all and Member States have taken no notice of the agreements .
There is a great deal of work to be done on this programme .
Secondly , we need to develop a crisis resolution mechanism to prevent us being thrown out of kilter again in the future should there be further storms on the markets .
I then asked him the question : how can one possibly come up with a new strategy without analysing the failure of a previous one ?
I have been listening very closely to the debate in this Chamber all afternoon and I have been hearing calls for more Europe , more centralisation , more central control .
These have to be ambitious yet realistic and attainable , paying heed to where each Member State started and its capacities .
They could also , if they wanted to - and in my opinion they should - coordinate their social policies .
Member States must be proactive in keeping to the commitments they have assumed within the European Council .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the Accession agreement of the EU to the European Convention on Human Rights .
I would like to mention that the European Union &apos;s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights obviously will not resolve the problem of the European Court of Human Rights being completely overloaded with work .
This report clarifies institutional and operational aspects arising from the European Union signing up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
The number of cases increases significantly from year to year .
In addition , the result of the whole cycle from production via use through to waste and recycling must be a positive one .
I call for greater investment in research and development into smart grids and battery technology , in order to make more efficient use of the primary materials in the batteries .
Electric vehicles compensate for this irregularity through their own special features .
( RO ) The extremely difficult situation which Greece is in , not to mention the deeply concerning information about other European Union Member States with serious problems , highlights to us that the economic crisis has not run its course and that , in spite of some progress made by the European Union &apos;s older countries , there is still the risk of major imbalances .
This year in Latvia , on 16 March , with the tacit approval of the authorities , Waffen SS veterans staged a march with flags in Riga in commemoration of the day on which the Latvian SS legion was founded .
I think that those elements , which have been reinforced in the new proposal , are extremely welcome as regards sustaining competition between independent repairers and market access for spare parts with equivalent quality markings : the opening up of that market is very welcome .
Authorised service stations , too , must have the right to buy parts from independent producers , as well as the tools and equipment used in their workshops .
That is what we wish to rectify .
on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group . - ( NL ) Thank you , Mr President , Commissioner and rapporteur .
Due to the time constraint , I had no time earlier on to say a few words about a healthy lifestyle .
To conclude , let me emphasise that the Commission is very committed to contributing to achieve the 20 @-@ 20 @-@ 20 targets by 2020 as set by the Heads of State and Government , and ICT has an important role to play in this .
This is the case even though the Commission is aware that Turkey is making nowhere near the required amount of progress in respect of the accession criteria .
On the whole , we can say that the EIB did well , and still leads the way in providing appropriate responses to the crisis , but further joint efforts will be required to be able to move forward with the European Commission and European Investment Bank , particularly in terms of job creation .
However , I would also like to take the opportunity to emphasise the importance of the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) for Europe and for the citizens of Europe and to highlight the fact that we must make greater use of this unique institution , in particular in times of economic crisis .
I think that the EIB has responded very promptly to the challenges presented by the crisis , for instance , by granting funding to Romania , amounting to a total of almost EUR 1.5 billion for 2009 .
( DE ) Mr President , it is sad that I have to bring this up in plenary .
What can the European Union do in such circumstances ?
This is why we are taking an interest in what happened on 7 March near the city of Jos .
- ( SK ) In my opinion , it is right for the European Commission and the European Parliament to be involved in regulating charges for passenger safety and protection in air transport .
This outright vote will do us Romanians , in particular , a big favour .
We welcome that because we , the United States , need strong allies and alliances to help us tackle the problems of the 21st century , many which are the same - but so many are different - than the last century .
President Obama and I also believe that government &apos;s primary , most fundamental and most solemn duty is to protect its citizens - the citizens it serves - as well as the rights they hold .
As it is not possible to curtail an MEP &apos;s mandate during a term , this means that Parliament will temporarily have 754 Members , making it necessary to change the Treaty so as to temporarily lift the limit of 751 Members .
I am satisfied for two reasons : the committee that I chair acted promptly , reaching a provisional agreement , and that agreement paved the way for the one reached today in plenary by a very large majority .
Electric and hybrid drive systems are currently still in their infancy and we need to put in place a standardised framework without giving this technology priority over other alternative drive systems .
In this document , the problem of cancer in the EU has been diagnosed and objectives set in the fight against cancer .
In the same way , the use of natural resources may be less harmful to the environment and produce less carbon with the help of the new technologies .
The EU must retain and reinforce its leadership role in the international fight against climate change .
Therefore , all the attention should be directed at the public use of that money .
The main Charlemagne Prize was presented on 13 May two days after the Youth Prize , also in Aachen , to the Prime Minister of Poland , Donald Tusk .
We have heard an explanation of the request .
What has been the response of Parliament to all of this ?
It was not possible for them to interpret your speech precisely .
Could this sole trader , who in today &apos;s economic climate is struggling , afford to pay this indirect tax , and indeed would he and his wife want this extra burden ?
This is important , therefore , in view of the need to speed up economic development in Europe and reduce unemployment , but it is also important because increasing numbers of women are deciding to start up on their own .
Self @-@ employed people are essential to the functioning of the economy and they have an irreplaceable role in society .
Thirdly , and vitally , Member States need to put in place upfront funding for energy @-@ efficiency improvements and , despite all the work of the rapporteur and the shadows &apos; best efforts , we did not get as far on this in the recast as we would have wished from Parliament &apos;s point of view .
( HU ) I congratulate Mrs Ţicău on her report and on the directive .
Social housing associations must receive encouragement and a substantial boost to ensure that they renovate the older buildings in the short term , so that the most disadvantaged tenants , too , can derive the maximum benefit from them .
However , we also believe that a proposal should not benefit one side only .
( DA ) Mr President , the textile industry is going through a period of dramatic change .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am keen to contribute to this debate because we are preparing to vote for what I believe to be an extremely important measure : it is important to rationalise the work of our enterprises , but especially to protect consumers .
These judgments do not give contracting authorities a blank cheque , but rather provide them with a clear framework .
A communication to clarify the way in which to use public procurement to promote sustainable development , social inclusion and innovation is currently being drafted .
At a time when multiple crises seriously threaten the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals , it is all the more important to ensure that our development policies are not undermined by action in other policy fields .
As rapporteur for the 2011 budget , I will reflect the majority position , although I will also set out my own green position .
Of course , the European Parliament should strive for legislative excellence .
As rapporteur , I would like to point out that the majority of the Committee on Budgets decided to place the additional money in the reserve - it has thus not yet been agreed by the Committee on Budgets - and to demand a precise evaluation .
The Commission believes that the EU can play a bigger part and be more active on resettlement by strengthening the Union &apos;s role globally and showing solidarity with the most affected regions .
This aims to move from only 10 Member States that currently resettle refugees at European level , so that we can try to ensure that the other 27 Member States will start resettling them .
The entire EU asylum concept is a disaster , as far as I am concerned .
I agree with your idea that the Global Programme Management Board must not be an assembly .
Contrary to what is being suggested , it will not be possible to mitigate these consequences using the measures that are being proposed relating to the sugar @-@ processing industry ; all the more so when its gradual abolition is also being suggested .
I can assure you that every effort will be made in the reform of the CAP in 2013 to take better account of current realities .
( CS ) We have passed a directive that will undoubtedly open up further opportunities for research into the energy efficiency of buildings and will contribute to savings in relation to the heating of buildings .
( FI ) Madam President , I voted in favour of the report , but I voted wrongly in the allimportant Article 34 , under Amendment 5 .
I express my support for the proposal to create a European Asylum Support Office .
I express my support for the recommendation to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
It is for that reason that I voted against this report .
A multilateral approach is desirable , involving all the relevant actors at local level and without forgetting the fundamental role played by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees .
in writing . - I and my British Conservative colleagues can agree with much of this report .
I voted for this report , since the preparation and implementation of the EU strategy for youth is very important , particularly at this time when the economic and financial crisis has had a negative impact on youth employment and still threatens their future prosperity .
I have therefore abstained from voting .
It was important to strengthen the protection of self @-@ employed women .
For these reasons , the ECR Group has abstained on amendments 1 @-@ 17 .
Without this assistance , Ukraine would be unable to further integrate fully into many areas of the economy and implement its further objectives .
I therefore voted in favour of this report with the objective of introducing , extending or adapting the existing exemptions for the Azores , the Canary Islands , Réunion and Madeira in the sugar , milk and wine sectors .
The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has meant that the European Parliament &apos;s powers have increased , which naturally means new funds to meet the increased needs .
The CAP should not be reduced just to the distribution of money .
While I support the report &apos;s objective of inviting the Commission to simplify public procurement procedures in order to save local government and enterprises from having to devote substantial amounts of time and money to strictly bureaucratic issues , I regret the wording of the second part of paragraph 9 .
I especially welcome the adoption , by a slim majority , of paragraph 70 , which asks the Commission systematically to include legally binding social and environmental standards in trade agreements negotiated by the European Union .
I would like to end by mentioning criteria such as the organisation and performance of collections , the specification of roles for competent authorities , the involvement of third countries , the swapping of organs with third countries and the safety of the process .
There are completely different systems for organ transplantation in the different countries of Europe and for how people give their consent or non @-@ consent , whether people &apos;s own organs may be used or whether family members can consent to a transplant .
This standard is a logical and very welcome step .
We must therefore encourage those patients who want to freely give their organs to save lives , because the risks of rejection during these transplants are significantly lower than in cases where the organs come from deceased donors .
I would like to again congratulate and thank Dr Mikolášik and Mr Perello Rodriguez for their contribution .
The negotiation directives should therefore mandate the Commission to negotiate a provision ensuring that the Union may accede to any of the additional protocols .
My suspicion is that one of the motives behind this proposal is a desire to enhance the status of the EU to show it is a player on the international stage .
That implies ad hoc legal assistance affording access to specialist external lawyers .
The European Union cannot continue to give contradictory signals .
It is better for citizens to have twice the rights than to have zero rights .
We need accession to the convention for symbolic reasons but , above all , we need the convention because it will complement the system of protection of human rights in the European Union and will give it greater credibility in the eyes of its citizens , for they will gain protection against the European Union and its institutions , and not only against the Member States , as has been the case until now .
All the rest is do @-@ gooding rhetoric that does not help immigrants to integrate , and certainly does not help our people .
I also believe that , in relation to freedoms and rights , we need to talk about the directive on rights to interpretation and translation in criminal proceedings .
As a result , the cost of making cuts will rise again .
While there will be a review this year , is it true that the State aid map review only allows a form of &apos; exchange &apos; as opposed to redesignating regions to reflect new economic realities following the financial crisis ?
Or is it the case that this article of the Treaty on European Union - in addition to dealing with visa policy towards third countries - can also be understood as binding the European Commission and EU Member States to seek to achieve common conditions for all EU Member States in third countries ?
In relation to this , I would like to ask the following question : do you observe that there is a greater tendency on the part of Member States of the Union in terms of cooperation , and is there also a greater tendency in terms of exchanging with each other the different and very important kinds of information necessary to combat terrorism ?
Some banks engage in financial speculation , but fortunately , we still have a banking network where the manager knows the businessman who goes to ask for credit , and so he can trust him , and also knows that the money he invests will be reinvested in the bank , and that what happened in the United States will not happen here .
In addition , during this legislature , we are going to work on services of general interest .
In order to implement the right of access to universal services , I believe it would be reasonable to define general principles and to set the recommended upper income limit at EU level .
It is essential that all developments carried out in the territorial waters of the European Union should be subject to special monitoring , and that they should comply with the highest safety standards and be equipped with the most modern safety systems .
A company entering into a deal with a certain degree of risk which must be tackled with specific safety measures and can generate huge revenue must also be prepared to suffer the consequences if an accident occurs .
First and foremost , we must assert that although deep @-@ sea drilling showcases state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art industrial technologies , it is still not without risk .
That is good news , but what is happening in the other Member States ?
I will now discuss the Commission &apos;s response .
What steps will the Commission take to prevent a repeat , in a similar situation , of the paralysis of almost the whole of Europe and , most of all , to improve the flow of information directed to passengers which , hitherto , has been decidedly lacking ?
This is a very clear message .
In order to be able to respond to the crisis in the financial sector , the European Union has planned a series of measures that are being debated in the next few days in Parliament : a supervision package , which I hope will be adopted as soon as possible .
This proposal sends an important signal to all that the euro area will withstand pressure with self @-@ confidence , and sustainable economic and fiscal policies will bring fruit for Member States .
I therefore think that the first thing that the Council must be asked to do is to be a little bit more discreet and to let the Commission and the European Central Bank come up with solutions .
It is time to safeguard the social state by means of the EU institutions , not to dismantle it .
We had the Stability Pact .
The countries of the euro area must put their budgets in order , publish honest figures , comply with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and purge their debts .
In the same period , the largest Dutch pension fund , ABP , spent EUR 1 billion on Greek government bonds in order to achieve a somewhat higher rate of interest .
Let us analyse all the political and electoral processes in recent months .
The crisis has continued .
Would it be sensible to introduce a monetary union along American lines without the necessary central controls on financial policy ?
We have to work on three strengths .
The Polish Minister for Culture and National Heritage , Bogdan Zdrojewski , has pointed out that one aspect which should be included in the Europe 2020 strategy is culture .
Relations between the European Union and the member countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council , which this year is chaired by Kuwait , are very important for our Parliament .
12 . Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in Kampala , Uganda (
We must defuse the debate about meat glues .
The idea of ultimately pursuing the defeated parties , in spite of the assurances that they are sometimes given , in order to reach a peace agreement would be to risk indefinitely prolonging conflicts ; this is the basis for our reservations about this report .
Energy efficiency ratings will also be displayed on all advertising containing information on energy consumption or which relates to product prices .
However , the principle of not paying for organs will not prevent live donors from being compensated , provided that such compensation is strictly limited to covering the costs and loss of income resulting from the donation .
We therefore deem this resolution worthy of our support .
Removing organs and carrying out the transplant , along with post @-@ transplant care , are expensive medical procedures , but every Member State must make efforts to encourage this type of medical procedure .
To render this accession effective , the unanimous agreement of the Members of the Council and approval by the European Parliament are required .
Consequently , it is important that an ever @-@ increasing number of states acknowledge the authority of the International Criminal Court and that the signatories of the Rome Statute ratify the agreement as a matter of urgency .
Since that vote , the economic health of Europe has deteriorated further .
These imbalances have been very obvious in the current crisis but , at the same time as urgently addressing this crisis , we must work on the economy in the medium and long terms .
Do this , and this will establish the link - Mrs Berès was just saying that this debate is a bit like a melting pot ; fiscal coordination will help establish the link between the EU 2020 strategy , the report on the governance of the euro area , on the single market , and employment and education issues .
With that , it is important that we enhance the synergies of research funding and regional development policy .
However , these arguments cannot hide the fact that this is about one thing : whether we actually want to combat poverty in Europe .
( NL ) The present discussion on this crisis has mainly covered budgetary discipline ; and rightly so , as it is important .
Innovation policy should be aimed at them also .
The fifth and final question is about the trust that needs to be rebuilt in European banks and financial markets and in the European project in general .
We support the need for strict financial discipline and a growth policy , so that Greece can break out of the vicious circle of deep recession and galloping inflation , with disastrous consequences for Greek society and the economy and , ultimately , a negative impact on Europe .
Investing in it bears no risk .
More Europe means something like root canal treatment : Member States will be obliged to accomplish the targets that are set out in this EU 2020 strategy .
( FR ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are all agreed on the major objectives of the EU 2020 strategy and , if we are all agreed on its objectives , we should now provide ourselves with the means to implement them .
I am a Portuguese national and at this very moment , the proposal that is being made is to increase taxes .
It has a dual objective .
These days it is important , as we highlight in this report , to emphasise that mobility between countries and between universities and business is a key to achieving greater cooperation between the two worlds , and we encourage not only the extension and expansion of individual mobility schemes such as Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs and Erasmus for Apprentices , but also the organisation of postgraduate European Masters of Excellence programmes , in cooperation with different universities and with the active participation of businesses .
The resolution which is being put to us today relates to the challenges in the relations between universities and business in connection with the implementation of the notorious Bologna process .
However , economic success must not be confused with social development , in society as in university ; and so this crossroads we have come to in third @-@ level education , with traditional student @-@ based learning in one direction , and the demands of modern business @-@ driven economies in the other , must be navigated with the greatest of care .
Secondly , exchanges of students and researchers between the universities of different countries , and increasing the funds available for their support .
This evening , it concerns extending the financial assistance provided by the EU for decommissioning the reactor units at the Kozloduy power plant in Bulgaria .
This is why I believe that the European Commission should first perform a specific evaluation to assess the strengths and weaknesses of past projects in order to improve funds programming together with the EBRD for the next funding period 2010 @-@ 2013 .
I am sure that the Council will take into account Parliament &apos;s opinions wherever they can help to improve the clarity of the regulation &apos;s objectives .
We all want the Union to work , and we all know it will be judged on its ability to deliver concrete projects for the region .
We had another dream concerning the Mediterranean back in 1995 , which took the form of the Barcelona Declaration , and then we just did it again in 2005 .
The representative of the Council could not be here today because it is Thursday morning and the debate on this report was originally scheduled for Monday .
One of the next occasions will be the discussion on the neighbourhood package where we assess both the bilateral and multilateral framework of our neighbourhood .
This will boost political stability and respect for human rights and will generate sustainable growth and prosperity in the region .
We must also acknowledge that the region is part of our common neighbourhood with Russia , and we have to try to find ways of promoting common policies in that common neighbourhood .
For that we need a strategy .
There is a fear that there may not be such a majority , today .
The most inspiring project is the grassroots Interfaith Harmony committees , if they succeed in alleviating tensions between different groups in the country and thus prevent the recruitment of terrorists .
It must be clear throughout the world that one of the core values of the EU is the high level of protection given to human and minority rights , which the Union considers first of all to be binding on itself , or would say that it ought to regard these as binding on itself .
Media sources such as TV , radio and Internet have been blocked .
If the state authorities use brute force and uncontrolled repression against the citizens of their own country , this deserves condemnation .
It should use all means to strengthen civil society and assist those who resist oppression in Burma .
3 . Burma (
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , let me first , on behalf of Mr Lewandowski , ask you to please accept his apologies for not being present .
We lay emphasis on the environment , but it is obvious that governments only want to hear about these commitments a lot further ahead .
If we want to reduce budgetary deficits , as well as taxes , and increase tax revenues , we need to reduce the burden of bureaucracy on small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and enable innovation , and we must finally reduce the merciless competition exerted by large @-@ scale industry on unpopular small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , and not encourage it .
Once again I would like to thank you for all your comments .
Therefore , it is critically important to come up with a new and fresh perspective , instead of offering that of the 20th century .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) cannot accept the unilateral introduction of a Tobin @-@ type tax , as specified in paragraph 8 , because it is hard to reconcile this with the idea of funding global public goods .
Against the background of worldwide demographic change , rapid population growth and the increasing scarcity of resources , we need to take far @-@ reaching measures on development cooperation .
It is right to establish regulations regarding the characteristics required in order for a section of railway to achieve categorisation as a European corridor , because this will help the state and regional authorities to plan , coordinate , and understand each other .
So do not worry , as there is no risk whatsoever of passengers losing any of the rights that they have acquired from freight .
This is the first to see the light of day .
Nevertheless , I think that we will have to accept this outcome , because in any case it is one which , in terms of its content , allows us to move forward .
That will then be followed by the right to legal advice and the right to communicate with people who are dear to the heart .
I also want to congratulate our Estonian friends on reaching this important milestone .
The Baltic tigers became the sick men of Europe following an economic boom lasting several years .
However , it could be just as active in other European countries as well .
I call on the Commission , as part of the future financial outlook , to increase the budget allocated to the development of the trans @-@ European transport system from 11 % of the cohesion policy budget to at least 20 % and to help narrow the gap in terms of transport infrastructure development between the countries in the centre and southeast of the European Union .
I would like to make two comments .
The next item is the report by Maria Badia i Cutchet , on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , on the Internet of Things - .
The Internet is , above all , an essential tool for exercising fundamental freedoms and for the public to enjoy genuine democracy .
The directive itself and , hence , its amendment , are supplementary in nature and only apply to vehicles over 3.5 tonnes , like other laws applicable to road transport activities .
Thus , we reject the Commission &apos;s proposal to exclude self @-@ employed drivers , for the following three reasons . Firstly , self @-@ employed drivers need to be covered by working time regulations so that we can ensure traffic safety in Europe .
Unfortunately , in reality , drivers no longer have this choice ; instead , they are generally being pushed into being self @-@ employed - or at least , ostensibly self @-@ employed .
She also knows quite well that activities such as customer contact are neither subject to monitoring nor counted as working time in any case .

Nutritional profiles discriminate against basic foods , and the threshold values for salt , sugar and fat are entirely arbitrary - having been thought up by Commission officials on no scientific basis whatsoever .
There is no College decision , however , and consequently , we need this to be clarified once and for all .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this regulation is of crucial importance for consumers and the agri @-@ food industry , because it is not at all easy to achieve balanced labelling that includes all the essential information but not so much as to complicate it .
This directly affects the choices available to consumers and has a disproportionately negative impact on staple foods .
The model I have in my mind is that of the responsible consumer who knows what he is buying .
( SK ) First , I would like to applaud the work of the rapporteur , Renate Sommer , who , in drawing up the report , has focused on improving the directive drafted by the Commission .
Even those people who do not think about what they eat have finally got the message that consuming excessive amounts of convenience foods , biscuits , sweets and alcohol is unhealthy .
Without this effort to ensure rigour in the use and compilation of data , the promises of rigour will not be kept .
In accordance with this Rule , I am obliged to do this .
Mr Swoboda has raised it , Sir Robert Atkins has recorded it as well .
It is more than the qualified majority .
Under these circumstances , I expect from the European Union the same solidarity and wholehearted support for Euskadi to build the peace and reconciliation that we are longing for .
In fact , the EPP has thus forcefully imposed its will on the entire Parliament !
The large number of sectors and businesses affected by the crisis and globalisation make questions as to whether the present European economic model will be viable and sustainable inevitable .
They have greater bureaucratic burdens , too many complex regulations , a lack of transparency in decision @-@ making processes and cofinancing rules , and delayed payments .
As ever , the transparency initiative is largely empty words , which is why I abstained from voting .
I support this regulation concerning the creation of a European rail network for competitive freight , the implementation of which , it is hoped , will have added value for the entire Community , because Europe will be linked by a common rail network .
Unfortunately , the adopted amendments restricted our options - those of Estonia and Latvia - and , as a result , we have moved no closer to linking up all the European Union Member States into a uniform railway system .
However , we would like to emphasise that we do not think it is necessary to increase direct agricultural subsidies .
However , the regulatory mechanisms that will be introduced very shortly thanks to the collaboration between the Commission , the Council and Parliament should not completely rein in the derivatives markets , which fulfil an important role in world finance .
Once a car has been connected to the net , it would be possible to give the driver information on tyre pressure .
These rights cannot be treated as mere intellectual property rights ; authors should be able to choose the way in which they want people to access their works .
According to the Commission , less than 1 % of the EU budget is currently spent directly on innovation @-@ related measures .
I would like to point out that poverty reduction through the achievement of the MDGs must be recognised as the overall goal of EU policy and Europe must lead the world in a concerted effort to keep the EU &apos;s promises to the planet &apos;s poorest .
In fact , extreme poverty has decreased , almost 90 % of poor children attend school and infant mortality is falling dramatically .
The next item is the Question Hour with the President of the Commission .
While oil exploration in Europe is not taking place in the same extreme conditions as those in the Gulf of Mexico , we must also deal with the possibility of an accident near our shores .
Will you and DG AGRI agree to look again at the suggestion of a five per cent flat @-@ rate disallowance , given that the department in Northern Ireland is taking remedial steps to ensure that systems are accurate and that money has already been recovered in relation to the original claims ?
I believe it makes sense to have these incentives for compliance - some people speak of sanctions - because we need the credibility of those instruments to ensure that the Stability and Growth Pact is respected .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , credit rating agencies were a matter of concern to this Parliament at the end of its previous term , and I should like to highlight in this regard the responsiveness of both the Commission and Parliament , which has adopted a regulation on credit rating agencies .
Can the agencies remain indifferent to the commitments of the European authorities and the efforts of the main international public actors ?
Knowing whether it is investors or issuers that have to pay the agencies , and whether the latter have to be private or public , independent or supervised , solves nothing .
( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thank you once again for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate , which comes days after yet another downgrading of the Greek debt by a credit rating agency .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when I had the honour of being heard by the European Parliament on 13 January , before being appointed as European Commissioner , I undertook to improve protection for investors and to reduce administrative costs to enterprises , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises which , as we know , account for 80 @-@ 90 % of the economic fabric within the single market .
Now the prospectus summary must simply correspond to the summary ; there cannot be a contradiction between the two .
We know what is pending given our assumptions .
However , such announcements are causing the greatest anxiety in countries such as Poland , because there is a real danger that the resources available for cohesion policy will be reduced , whereas cohesion policy is , in principle , one of the foundations of the European Union .
Unfortunately , the economic and financial crisis is having an impact on both the EU and national budgets .
In the run up to these elections , the Commission will also pay particular attention to other key aspects of democratisation , notably freedom of assembly , of the media and of NGOs and civil society , more generally , where no progress has been reported in recent times .
The Commission is aware of the concern among NGOs that European Structural Funds are being used to renovate existing , or build new , long @-@ stay residential institutions for people with disabilities , in contravention of the rights of these citizens .
Since the launching of the Community strategy on endocrine disruptors in 1999 , we have invested heavily through the Community research budget to increase our understanding of the mechanisms by which substances affect the functioning of endocrine systems .
But , to be honest , your question is very relevant .
Questions which have not been answered for lack of time will receive written answers ( see Annex ) .
We must take into account the need for a new , socially sustainable model , which must integrate the full range of skills that women have to offer into the economy , restore the balance in terms of women &apos;s and men &apos;s responsibilities in public and private life , and guarantee such a work / life balance .
Our gender equality strategy , which I will present in the autumn of this year , will contain many very concrete elements - not for the next few months but for the next years .
At the same time , however , there have been no improvements with regard to closing the gap between women &apos;s and men &apos;s pay .
That is why it is important for us to set clear short- , medium- and long @-@ term objectives , for us to put specific measures in place which attack urgent problems and for us to provide real resources for our actions and ambitions .
The gender question must find significant reflection in the Union budget .
The BONUS research programme , which is well worth supporting and an excellent initiative , is an outcome of the EU &apos;s Baltic Sea Strategy .
Parliament rejected the proposals that were submitted to it last October .
He has really done an exceptional job for Romania and Bulgaria .
Although the existing public and private regulations may conflict with each other and create legal uncertainty , the findings of the study show that few obstacles exist to the free provision of agents &apos; activities across the EU .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
We have also repeatedly condemned use of the death penalty , particularly for minors .
Concerning bus and coach passengers &apos; rights , since the adoption of the Council common position , informal discussions between Council and the European Parliament attempted to find a compromise agreement on the text .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal on the rights of passengers travelling by bus and coach aims to aid and protect passengers , in particular , persons with disabilities or reduced mobility .
Thus , we should stop talking about integrating disabled people into society .
ITS applications such as dynamic traffic and freight management , lane @-@ keeping support and electronic tolling ( e @-@ Toll ) bring clear benefits to transport users in terms of reducing travel times and increasing safety .
Compliments to Mrs Jensen and also Mr Kallas for outlining the benefits .
The compromise suggests 15 June 2015 .
The vote will take place tomorrow ( Tuesday , 6 July ) .
So , thank you all for your fine work .
The report provides valuable pointers in this respect , which indicate the direction that we must move in .
I listened to colleagues who mentioned bicycles .
The Treaty of Lisbon , which entered into force on 1 December 2009 , as well as confirming the right to petition the European Parliament as one of the pillars of European citizenship , has also established the necessary bases for increasing public participation in the European Union &apos;s decision @-@ making process , offering Europeans the opportunity to suggest improvements or additions to the Union &apos;s legislation .
I believe that this indicates that the public really views Parliament as a very useful tool when it comes to presenting it with all types of petitions : environmental problems , fundamental rights , justice , the internal market , etc .
There is a suggestion that compensation will only amount to about 20 % .
( ES ) Mr President , from this forum of liberty , I salute the memory of José Saramango , who I met because of his great interest in two writers from my city , Oviedo : Leopoldo Alas and Ángel González .
I have talked with very many citizens about the citizens &apos; initiative , and in general , they do not really know there is such a thing .
The people of Cumbria are honest folk .
This situation is unacceptable , so there must be policies in place to prevent such exploitation from continuing , creating jobs for young people , but also protecting the rights they do have .
A number of my colleagues wished to speak on the subject , but were not given the opportunity to do so .
This is a report that is ambitious , but also realistic , because we want , for example , selective waste collection to be compulsory , provided it is possible from a local , economic and environmental point of view .
However , there can be no talk of such changes if people &apos;s general standard of living does not improve .
I firmly believe that it is absolutely essential to set up a Baltic Sea environmental monitoring centre and an alarm system in the event of accidents and incidences of severe cross @-@ border pollution , as well as a joint action force for dealing with these situations .
( The sitting was closed at 23.15 )
As I said previously in my hearings before Parliament , I believe the relationship with the European Parliament is key to ultimately undertaking a reform of the common agricultural policy which is more in tune with the expectations of citizens and even better understood by European citizens .
Regional variation must therefore be taken into consideration and catered for in the post @-@ CAP 2013 .
It is insulting that the economic crisis is being used as a pretext to cut benefits to farmers .
The fact that the report calls for aid per hectare is a positive thing .
The rest are all add @-@ ons to ensure that we have a profitable farming sector to be able to deliver the environmental benefits , to tackle climate change and all the other things we set out in the report .
It is true that we will only begin to taste the fruit of these laws much later , perhaps ten years later .
Other enterprises , such as the Doux Group , had already anticipated this move by buying out the Brazilian Frangosul Group in 1998 .
This will be the fourth EU @-@ Brazil Summit at which we will aim to take stock of progress in our relations and discuss the main global challenges .
On 5 May of this year , this House supported the reopening of negotiations in the Salafranca report .
If there is a rise in imports due to these talks , I believe we will see an exodus of farmers from the industry .
On the one hand , in a multipolar world where the BRIC countries are gaining ever more influence , it is vital that the EU establishes a privileged relationship with Latin American countries , where it holds more investment than Russia , India and China put together .
Given the existing trends and potential increase in dependence , the current reform of the common fisheries policy is a good opportunity for the EU to reinforce the economic performance of the sector and its ability to compete globally .
There are major challenges involved in regulating the import of fishery and aquaculture products into the EU .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my group opposes this .
I think it is very important that we can fight terrorism together , and it is very important that nations that have the same values can work together .
Unfortunately , I did not have any option other than to vote against this text .
We must give more attention to the development of rural areas , expansion of infrastructure , educational affairs and the demographic situation .
I voted for the Alvaro report concerning the new SWIFT agreement , which outlines conditions for the transfer of certain banking data stored by SWIFT at the US Treasury Department as part of the fight against terrorism .
Even though a certain amount of progress has been made in the negotiations , the fundamental problem of the bulk transfer of bank data still remains .
With the new competences that it has acquired since the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon , the European Union needs to rely on strong diplomacy .
It is not about duplicating diplomatic services within the EU , but about strengthening the EU &apos;s diplomatic services .
On one hand , I lend my support to the idea of the long @-@ term inclusion of this country , which is justified in particular by the great effort and progress already made .
An end to the stigmatisation of , and discrimination against , carriers of HIV / AIDS must also be promoted .
Given that the EU must ensure food security for its citizens and the long @-@ term development of the agricultural sectors , agriculture must undergo major changes to maintain productivity , at a time when it needs to adapt to more stringent environmental restrictions than are currently in place .
in writing . - ( DE ) The new common agricultural policy ( CAP ) is intended to enter into force for European agriculture from 2014 .
It penalises developing countries by calling for a delay in phasing out export refunds in the worst kind of blatant protectionism .
The EU must make efforts to sustainably increase fish production from aquaculture so as to reduce imports in the fishery and aquaculture products sector .
I therefore hope that we will denounce this situation with a very broad majority and that both the EU and Southern Africa will finally call for an end to these conditions .
He was arrested for providing information on the Kimberley Process .
A similar clause in the Treaty on the implementation of the Inter @-@ American Convention against Corruption was used by Venezuela to prevent NGOs reporting on corruption in this country .
The criticism made by the authors , who have used it against China , is a classic example of hypocritical buck @-@ passing , and reveals the policy of double standards applied by the authors .
It was the great powers that divided Koreans , and they must therefore work together now to put consistent pressure on the North Korean leadership , including the threat of criminal prosecution for crimes against humanity , in order to free the North Korean people .
13 . Funding and functioning of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (
Documents received : see Minutes
We are almost half of the planet &apos;s inhabitants .
There is still a long way to go .
I urge the EU institutions to redouble efforts and use all tools of diplomacy and cooperation assistance available to them to work towards the abolition of the death penalty
That would at least address the problem adequately .
Our joint task is precisely to anticipate disasters , not to simply wait for them to occur and then muster the resources to deal with them .
Sound regulation would be the big stick par excellence to induce oil companies primarily to take a great many measures themselves to reduce the risks - that is why I consider this important .
I feel that it is very important that third countries are included in this resolution .
Let us not be under any illusions , however . Our European economy and society will continue to require large volumes of oil for transport for the coming 20 to 30 years at least .
the oral question to the Commission by Jo Leinen , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on key objectives for the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in Nagoya , 18 @-@ 29 October 2010 - B7 @-@ 0468 / 2010 ) ;
The Commission is currently updating its own biodiversity @-@ related development cooperation figures , using the same methodology as it has used to account for climate @-@ related funding , and we are , of course , encouraging Member States to do the same so that we can present a consolidated figure in Nagoya .
Over 60 % of all fish and shellfish eaten in the EU are caught outside the EU .
If you are going to preach , which is what you are doing , look in the mirror first , sort your own house out and let us start with the disaster which is the common fisheries policy .
It will be important and essential to observe how the consistency that we are going to see and hope to see - as we are demanding for Nagoya - is maintained in Paris , when we really understand that protecting bluefin tuna means protecting not only an animal , but also a way of life , a culture and , above all , a way of seeing the world that relates to humanity .
We need to define a strong common position and ensure the European Union &apos;s active participation in future international negotiations .
We need a mechanism which will drive the change which everybody recognises .
Most of the instruments are to be found at the Member State level .
The expectations of the Albanian and Bosnian and Herzegovinian public , that tomorrow in this House , we will be giving the green light , are legitimate , and these people deserve that .
Mr President , I have every confidence that , tomorrow , a large majority of this House will vote in favour of visa @-@ free travel for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania .
The European Commission - and we in Parliament - want to lift this isolation .
Let us hope that these two countries will even be able to benefit from this exemption over the Christmas period .
Together with the unfulfilled customs union agreement , this shows just how unready for accession Turkey is and is another slap in the face of the European Union .
Those forms among the diversity of the European banking system that particularly proved themselves during the financial crisis - and that means those banks that looked after the small and medium @-@ sized business sector and those banks that were focusing on private customers and thus did not elicit cross @-@ border risks - must not be penalised for the solidarity of their establishment .
( SV ) Madam President , it is , in many respects , a positive sign that work on the new capital adequacy rules is progressing .
Basel III and deposit protection need to be connected , as there is a connection between the two .
A weak , inadequate response will be an incentive and stimulus for infringements .
I am well aware , in our view , that companies take these compliance programmes seriously and that can help prevention which , in fact , Mr Gauzès , is still cheaper than compensation or punishment .
The working @-@ class struggle , the reconstruction of and counter @-@ attack by the working @-@ class and grassroots movement throughout Europe can consign these resolutions where they belong : to the dustbin of history .
The next item is the report by Mrs De Keyser , on behalf of the Committee on Development , on health care systems in sub @-@ Saharan Africa and global health .
The pharmaceutical multinationals continue to prevent the cheaper production of medicines that would enable the lives of millions of people to be saved .
Sure enough , the &apos; earmarking &apos; that Mrs Hübner introduced for the Lisbon Strategy did work at the time .
( FR ) Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we have reached a pivotal moment in the debate on the future of the European Social Fund ( ESF ) .
We cannot force people to accept it . The acceptance has to develop from the bottom upwards as part of regional policy .
Under a number of new proposals , some of this budget would be redirected after 2013 towards fulfilling the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy .
It is important that you , in the Commission , see cohesion policy as an investment rather than expenditure and as an opportunity to generate trust and sustainable development .
It is also an important tool which will be much needed by the Union in the future as well .
I think that is important .
They therefore deserve to be included in the discussion on cohesion policy after 2013 .
A general review of the application and effectiveness of EU structural funds in Latvia needs to be carried out urgently .
Neither the uprisings in East Berlin in 1953 and in Poland and Hungary in 1956 , nor the Prague Spring of 1968 , succeeded in seriously shaking the foundations of communist rule .
There is always a risk that no attention will be paid to these things and that they will not be valued .
The second was economic and social , and equally difficult to meet .
( ES ) Mr President , I voted in favour of this initiative in order to condemn the mass human rights violations and the use of rape as a weapon of war against women , boys , girls and babies ; in order to ask for those implicated to be held responsible ; in order to demand more commitment from the United Nations following the failure of the actions of the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ; in order to demand a political solution to the armed conflict , which needs to happen by resuming the dialogue on the peace process ; and in order to demand greater commitment from the Great Lakes region to promoting peace and stability in the region .
No nationals of third countries living in EU territory who are legally resident should be subjected to discrimination of any kind .
The EGF must be more flexible if we want to avoid drowning in uncertainty .
It stresses that , in accordance with Article 6 of the EGF Regulation , it should be ensured that the EGF supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment .
Those who today claim to be rewarding the Balkan countries are the same ones who , yesterday , were doing all they could to destroy Yugoslavia and dismantle its peoples &apos; achievements .
Civilians continue to suffer unbearably and live in poverty .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am very concerned about events in the Democratic Republic of Congo , where hundreds if not thousands of women and children have been raped in the last few months .
Irrespective of the seriousness of the specific individual actions which , in theory , might motivate or even justify such a sentence , I believe that the abolition of the death penalty represents an enormous step forward for civilisation and a distinctive feature of penal systems , such as those of the Union &apos;s Member States , that seek to separate justice from revenge .
However , I disagree with the imposition of a moratorium on any new deep sea oil drilling in EU waters , even if these standards are ensured throughout the EU , due to the disproportionate nature of this measure compared with the impact that it could have on the industry .
Biodiversity issues must be taken into account when farming practices are being implemented .
Although studies have estimated the current economic costs of the loss of biodiversity to be around EUR 50 billion per year , this matter is not on the international political agenda .
I voted for this report as it backs the reform process , but I will not support any calls to weaken the proposals adopted by Basel .
However , the European Union has a particular role to play in the implementation of solidarity @-@ based health structures by providing guidance and funding basic health care systems , together with access to drugs .
It is essential to help the least favoured areas to develop ; to enhance the efficient allocation of funds for innovation , technology and education ; and to implement measures to stimulate employment and competitiveness , in particular .
In this context , the Structural Funds &apos; potential needs to be strengthened through simplifying and improving the relevant procedures .
in writing . - We have supported the text which , among other things , notes the key role played by the European Social Fund ( ESF ) in improving employment and job opportunities , promoting the adaptation of workers &apos; skills to the demands of the labour market , and workers &apos; integration into the labour market , and reinforcing social inclusion .
These are balanced and workable proposals , in line with the recommendations of the International Labour Organisation and the World Health Organisation .
The mother must not be in conflict with the woman worker .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the road towards a female @-@ friendly Europe is still long and arduous .
However , I find that some of the amendments from the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender Equality and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs go too far .
Hence , there is no dispute as to the principle .
Personally , I shall not be voting for this report in its present form , and I call on all my fellow Members to reject all those amendments that have nothing to do with maternity protection , such as the provisions concerning self @-@ employed workers .
Women must be protected so that they can choose to have children without having to leave the labour market .
They often work outside legal regulations and do not enjoy any rights ...
I very much hope that Parliament and the Council will be able to reach a compromise .
Cramming them all into the same package would result in poor legislation and breach the principle of subsidiarity .
Like your rapporteur , Mr Rangel , I am also of the opinion that this revision is a significant achievement which will deepen the relations between our institutions and offer practical solutions in line with Parliament &apos;s increased competences following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty .
The Parliament &apos;s team have a mission to increase Parliament &apos;s power and influence , and they have had a measure of success .
In addition , the high @-@ profile role which Parliament will have in drafting the EU &apos;s annual work programme strengthens citizens &apos; involvement in setting the priorities for European policies .
In my opinion , the Member States cannot then be allowed to start their own negotiations with the US in this area , because this quite simply undermines our negotiating position on data protection .
I believe that this twin @-@ track approach should no longer be tolerated .
In 2007 and 2008 , the European Parliament was not represented , for obvious reasons .
The EU needs to go further .
In short , we want a fisheries industry , but not in this form which jeopardises the small @-@ scale structures , the local structures , with its negative actions .
These financial circles pay no attention to employees anymore , and their money @-@ grubbing practices are not even halted by an ecological disaster .
The Commission should make it unmistakably clear that infringing minority rights represents an infringement against the values of the EU .
Without the intensive involvement of all these four groups in the process of establishing standards , Europe will find it difficult to standardise its knowledge in the low carbon economy , electric cars , nanotechnology and ICT .
We have created synergies through the joint use of the accounting system and we are granting the Commission &apos;s internal auditor the power to monitor how the funds that it needs to carry out its work efficiently are managed .
Of course , in keeping with what you have said , we condemn all acts of terror .
It has taken time and we fought hard to achieve it , but I believe that we can also say that , with this , we have laid a good foundation that will enable the new European External Action Service to enhance the EU &apos;s role in the world , under the full and sound scrutiny of Parliament and the citizens , and that is important .
That can be an added value provided by the European Union .
Budget neutrality is vital if the European External Action Service is to gain and retain the confidence and approval of all of Europe &apos;s citizens .
The key elements are , above all , the annual statements of assurance and activity reports that are to be presented to Parliament , as well as the European Parliament &apos;s power of discharge .
However , this support does not equate to giving carte blanche .
The European Commission will present a European Platform against Poverty by the end of this year , setting out concrete measures to support Member States in reaching the target of lifting at least 20 million European citizens out of poverty by 2020 .
( DE ) Madam President , it is disturbing that thousands of people in the EU are living on the poverty line despite having a permanent job .
The figures are alarming and we are behind the indicators , at a time when demand and expectations are very high .
A conference on child poverty was organised in September .
We have , therefore , a unique opportunity to introduce the entire international community to the problems of the poor and socially excluded and to suggest specific solutions .
Now is not the time for simply delivering speeches , but now is the time to implement those speeches and this is the time for delivering action .
I do not doubt that Europe , a symbol of solidarity , will show itself to be equal to it .
As the report clearly states , &apos; the availability of comprehensive and homogeneous statistics by type of goods for all the modes of transport would provide a general framework useful to support and monitor the policy promoting co @-@ modality , i.e. the possibility of optimally combining various modes of transport within the same transport chain , and the modernisation of freight transport logistics . &apos; 
I believe that the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund is justified in this case .
This is the second time that Portugal has submitted an application for the mobilisation of the EGF to the Norte region .
The report adopted today concerned an application for funding submitted by Spain in relation to 1 429 workers in 23 different firms in the motor vehicle industry , totalling EUR 2 752 935 .
I voted with this in mind .
It is very important to grant all employees equal access to social services and benefits , including maternity leave , healthcare and retirement pensions , as well as to education and training , regardless of their employment conditions .
Companies have reacted to the current economic and financial crisis by cutting temporary jobs , such as fixed @-@ term contract workers , and have hired personnel or employees on other kinds of non @-@ permanent contract .
We are going to vote tomorrow , and we are going to give attention to the position drawn up by the Committee on Budgets .
I would now like to draw your attention more specifically to certain points .
I call on my colleagues to approve the draft budget .
Those in the Council who are criticising , for example , the increase in payment appropriations , are being unfair to this budget .
We believe that is too quick , too soon and too much .
However , with regard to mobility , young people are also required to take responsibility , and this programme ought to be utilised a lot more .
Alongside this , we also need to discuss adjustment of the budgetary interinstitutional agreement ( IIA ) .
My concern here is , above all , the administrative budget , simply because the focus is always very heavily on this in the Member States , too .
I am not saying that to put the blame on you alone .
The votes will take place on Wednesday .
I assure you that we shall be talking of this matter for many years to come if we manage to achieve this .
This has also been covered by others before me .
The resources must be used more efficiently in many areas .
However , there must be a certain balance which takes into account the different levels of development of different Member States .
In connection with World Food Day on 16 October 2009 , the FAO has recently indicated that the situation remains unsatisfactory despite a slight improvement regarding the number of those suffering from chronic hunger in the world ( 925 million this year , compared with 1.023 billion in 2009 ) .
( EL ) Thank you , Commissioner , for your reply .
For the post @-@ 2013 period , the Commission will study and assess the various options for reforming the direct payment system .
I have explained to you that this was the government &apos;s decision .
The reform was also requested by the small businesses that expressed their wishes within the framework of the Small Business Act . They wanted payment practices in Europe to be organised in a considerably more efficient manner .
It is devoid of meaning if you let public authorities off the hook .
The justification that public authorities are at an advantage in that they can obtain financing on more attractive terms than businesses , or are less dependent on building stable relationships , may be valid for national authorities or European institutions , but is definitely not valid for most smaller towns and rural municipalities , not only in the Czech Republic , but throughout Europe .
I also see definite success on the horizon .
Concerning this last point , I would like to mention that next week , the Commission will adopt the communication on the reinforcement of EU disaster response capacity which will address the response to various types of disasters , including industrial accidents , and will strengthen our capacity to respond collectively .
What makes the situation even more serious is that the victims cannot even count on the Solidarity Fund , as this is not a natural disaster , and the value of the estimated damage does not exceed the prescribed EUR 591 million , but it is a case of serious human negligence .
Obviously , companies have had way too much leverage in negotiating with national authorities over what constitutes hazardous waste that should fall under the strictest safety standards .
And by the way , our citizens are perplexed as to why we can help Pakistan when we cannot help Ajka .
I should also point out that the CNIL has itself confirmed the existence of four illegal files which contain personal data , in which the subjects are described as Gyppos , Gypsies or Roma .
Are there other Member States where we could verify the possible existence of databases containing data on ethnic or racial origins ?
I have a copy of the consolidated treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights in my hands , and I hope you will forgive me if I do not entirely share your enthusiasm .
However , the only Member State that has been addressing this matter and creating legislation on it is the United Kingdom .
I therefore urge Member States to go all the way towards these important goals and to pursue this agenda as a matter of urgency .
Moreover , we suggest that , in a monetary union , debt should also be managed in common and that we should be able to envisage mutual debt issuance .
The report by Mrs Berès and the report by my colleague , Mrs Podimata , will show us whether this House is prepared to say : &apos; We know that it will not be easy , but we insist that the European Union makes a start at levying taxes transnationally on the financial sector if it cannot be taxed at national level &apos; .
Mr President , Mr Chastel , Mr Barroso , if I have understood you rightly Mr Barroso , we are starting from completely opposite analyses , since you said that the economic crisis is behind us , whilst our group , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , believes that it is getting worse .
Unfortunately , the last few days have been a disappointment .
The initial energy has dissipated and all too often we are back to &apos; business as usual &apos; .
Above all , however , it is also being conducted to the detriment of wages .
This is extremely dangerous .
We should have a high representative for economic affairs in the same way as we have a High Representative for Foreign Affairs .
What stands out is the crucial role that this House and the national parliaments must have in this area .
The top priority is still to create a stable basis which will systematically promote sustained , balanced economic growth .
Voting time
Explanations of vote
I believe that under this new framework agreement , Parliament is a more active partner in building the European project , as it can fulfil its powers more completely , effectively and responsibly .
The EEAS represents yet another example of wasted taxpayer &apos;s money , for a service my constituents do not want but have forced upon them by bureaucrats who seek to squeeze more and more power away from national governments towards the EU .
Those who are absent are always in the wrong .
By helping the banana sector in these countries , we are helping them develop their economy , create jobs and fight poverty .
Even though citizens &apos; disillusionment with the European Union is clear , the latter is still increasing its budget by 6 % to finance policies that it has arrogated to itself .
Some further steps to simplify the bureaucracy are also envisaged .
Today , in order to solve as soon as possible the demographic problems we face due to the low birth rate and ageing society , we must share family commitments .
It will , furthermore , compromise a woman &apos;s return to work in exactly the same position as she held before going on leave .
Third , the negative consequences for the employability of women are real , not least when it comes to returning to the job market .
There are clearly certain points connected with some amendments on which I have voiced a contrary opinion .
If we do not guarantee decent wages during maternity leave , women are punished in their earnings for having children .
I support the need to reinforce Directive 2000 / 35 / EC and identify instruments necessary to eliminate or reduce late payments in commercial transactions .
The principle of paying for work on time is a fundamental principle of correct behaviour but is also of crucial importance in determining the solidity of an enterprise , its available funds and its access to credit and finance .
It calls on the Member States to &apos; take a fresh look &apos; at policies to guarantee an adequate income , knowing that decent and viable jobs need to be created in order to combat poverty .
We must guarantee future generations decent wage levels , career stability , access to public services and social integration throughout their lives - from the earliest age until retirement .
Poverty cannot be effectively tackled merely by means of administrative regulations , even those which set minimum incomes .
We voted in favour of this report , but we voted against , and are strongly opposed to , the recommendation for the introduction of a financial transaction tax and the distribution of the debt amongst the countries of the euro area .
Eurocracy and bureaucracy are no answer to the crisis . Rather , thanks to their enforced conformity and the fact that they ignore cultural differences , they helped to create it .
Instead , it is useful to apply consistency and a systematic approach to economic action in the face of increasingly complex situations , where currency challenges are not the same as in the past and require different instruments and objectives where the responsibilities shouldered by the technicians must be backed by ongoing and consistent monitoring as well as political direction based on a considered view of the future and an eye to resolving contingent problems .
I abstained on the Feio report , because the proposals on European economic governance do not address the structural problems of incomplete economic union and do not alleviate the asymmetry between &apos; truncated &apos; economic union and full monetary union .
In the end , I believe that this is the way that the requests of European citizens are going .
The Commission then created the little instrument that is the ICI Instrument .
This is partly due to the weak institutions in the recipient countries , but it is also due to faulty incentive structures and a lack of documented accountability .
On account of the privileged partnership that it maintains with ACP countries , the European Union nonetheless wanted to help banana @-@ producing ACP countries to cope with this increased competition .
However , every year , EUR 3 billion worth of aid gets lost due to qualitative defects .
Mr President , I make no secret of the fact that the provisions set out in the Banana Accompanying Measures are a gamble on the future , for various reasons .
So we must continue to focus on both institutional and economic reforms to be undertaken by Ukraine in parallel .
A situation in which a media magnate at one and the same time both heads the state security service and is a member of the High Judicial Council , which has the power to appoint and dismiss judges , is not characteristic of a democratic state .
This allows us to evaluate the quality of the democratic process , institutions &apos; stability , the maturity of the political parties and the views of civil society .
The work relating to the code of conduct is now in its final phase and should be finished by the end of the year .
At the same time , efforts will continue or will be stepped up at national level in order to gradually reduce the early school @-@ leaving rate by 2020 , in accordance with the target set by the European Council .
Subject : Bio @-@ waste
I am just wondering what steps the Council has taken with respect to that .
That is what is absolutely intolerable about the proposal that the Commission is making .
In other words , this must not turn into an example of how long the political process can take .
A comment was also raised concerning cotton exports .
I believe that the proposed regulation under discussion is beginning to inject some order into an ever more confused global market .
I firmly believe that introducing an effective system for marking the origin of products from third countries will be extremely beneficial both to our European consumers and to compliant manufacturers .
Above all , I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs , Mr Susta and Mr Rinaldi .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are clearly faced with a text whose complexity troubles many of us and , even more , in my opinion , the citizens of Europe .
Do , please , persuade us that this text from 2 October is a positive and necessary thing .
That is not to say that something as embarrassing as the seizing of anti @-@ HIV drugs in the port of Rotterdam will not happen again .
There is a reference to privacy and I see no reason why privacy would be under attack .
We urge the people of Moldova to show that European spirit in the elections next month .
I was in Chişinău and Tiraspol last week and I noticed that becoming European is also at stake in the election campaign which is due to start for the November elections .
The EUR 90 million granted to this country in macro @-@ financial assistance was and still is the lifeline which Moldova and its citizens needed to make progress and , in particular , to meet the commitments it has made in the area of reforms , the rule of law and the fight against corruption .
Is she willing or ready to do anything about it as regards the introduction of a law ?
The coastline of the EU is 23 000 kilometres in length and one third of the population lives by the sea .
However this requires a global , cross @-@ sectoral policy that takes into account all civil society actors as well as the strategies and responsibilities of local and regional authorities in coastal areas .
We are therefore expecting a great deal of Mrs Damanaki on this point .
( EL ) Commissioner , almost every civilisation in the history of Europe has been based on the sea .
( ES ) Mr President , thank you for your generosity .
I hope to present the award to him in person here in Strasbourg in December , which would be a tremendous moment for the European Parliament and for all Cuban prisoners of conscience .
It provides support , not only for lasting social , economic and political development , but also for gradual integration of these countries with the world economy .
I hope that we are sending out a signal that we have taken action in this area .
The amendment will allow for the financing of these costs in exceptional circumstances , thus creating greater flexibility in the implementation of programmes and projects .
If there is one area in which the EU &apos;s involvement has been useful , it is in protecting consumer rights , by imposing rules that defend their rights and guarantee consumers enough information to consciously exercise their freedom of choice .
Then it will be possible to speak of fair rules of play .
I must also highlight the start of negotiations on the association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova on 12 January 2010 , and I underscore the good results the Commission is having with the Republic of Moldova in this process .
With this report we are expressing our support for the package on integrated maritime policy proposed in 2009 by the European Commission , because we believe it represents an ambitious cross @-@ sectoral strategy for economic development , a high level of employment , and environmental protection in coastal regions and maritime sectors .
From now on it is up to the Commission to take account of this policy requirement of Parliament in future negotiations .
Maybe we should have closer cooperation with all African countries and with the African Union and try and get them to understand the situation so that the European Union does not continue to give money if human rights violations continue .
( FI ) Mr President , it is no wonder that our fellow Members here are so infuriated by Mugabe .
Anyone who locks up the leader of the opposition party also locks up a large proportion of the people of the country who are represented by this person .
We look forward and will see to it that the representatives of Memorial have the freedom to come to this Parliament , thereby symbolising the freedoms and rights that all citizens in the Northern Caucasus enjoy .
Oleg Orlov , a member of the Memorial group , is a sorry example of the persecution of those who defend human rights .
I should also like to note that Italy also has another reason to weep today , although for a completely different reason : the collapse of Pompeii .
Therefore , the economy and jobs will be at the heart of the summit &apos;s discussions .
However , it needs to be done in a coordinated way .
As rapporteur for the European Parliament , it is a pleasure for me to take this opportunity to assure the Commission that the present draft has the broad support of all the groups in Parliament .
If we want real balance , development and security issues need to be divided between the United States and Europe within the framework of international action in general .
By insisting on frequent bilateral summits , we risk devaluing them to the extent that they will become irrelevant .
The last question was on the 100 % scanning of inbound container freight .
We need constructive , strengthened cooperation in areas such as overcoming the economic and financial crisis , the fight against terrorism , global stability , peace in the Middle East , the non @-@ proliferation of nuclear weapons , development aid and climate change .
I am therefore asking the representatives of the Council and the Commission for five things .
For this reason , we must welcome the communication from the Commission on the global approach to transfers of PNR data to third countries and its recommendations that the Council authorises the opening of negotiations in this area with Australia , Canada and the United States , as both instruments take up Parliament &apos;s concerns regarding security , defending fundamental rights and protecting personal data .
However , I am pleased that the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission are on the same wavelength and have the same balance at the back of their minds : a balance between data protection and security for which we all bear responsibility .
The present proposal fully meets the wish of Commissioner Barnier - which is also my wish - to extend effective , appropriate regulation and supervision to all actors and financial activities which present significant risks .
The gold plated remuneration and bonuses of managers will be limited and will not be able to be cashed in full immediately .
Of course not , but the EU does not care .
( PT ) I would like to begin by congratulating the Commissioner , the representatives of the Council , the shadow rapporteurs and , in particular , Parliament &apos;s rapporteur .
Let me congratulate Mr Gauzès once again .
This is what Mario Monti concluded in the report commissioned by President Barroso , a report which you have debated on many occasions and which contains many useful findings .
You got a flavour of some of the debates to come .
This is where the real added value of the EU lies .
One thousand five hundred texts !
Indeed , many achievements can be listed which have simplified our life within the EU .
How are we going to support it ?
( ES ) Mr President , I would like to celebrate the fact that there is innovation , attention to innovation , and also partnership , but I would also like to say that we do not know what this thing is that we are talking about .
As this motion for a resolution highlights , in order to safeguard the global , cooperative concept of security that characterises the OSCE and also makes it unique , the Action Plan must strike a balance between the three dimensions .
Finally , the Charter for European Security recognises the important role of the economic and environmental dimensions .
All this has meant that Taiwan &apos;s net migration rate stands at just 0.15 % .
The West must not forget who defended the principles of liberty when they were under threat elsewhere .
Things have been building up which provide food for thought , both regarding totalitarianism , which I hope has left our country for good , and about another modern scourge - terrorism , which we are seeing ever more frequently .
Elderly people who can and wish to remain active on the labour market can still make a contribution to the development of society without , however , feeling obliged to do so .
( SK ) Demographic changes gradually and fundamentally alter the structure of the population and the age pyramid .
The call for a European Youth Guarantee , whereby young people , after a maximum period of four months &apos; unemployment , are to be offered a job , an apprenticeship or other training opportunity , is an interesting proposal that we need to look at in more detail .
If science , innovation and education are to be pillars of economic growth and job creation , it is vital to bear in mind the proposals contained in this report and to focus more on science and research .
The estimate for the most likely error in cohesion spending was significantly lower than in previous years , and for the budget as a whole , the Court &apos;s estimate of errors has fallen over recent years .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are still faced with the fundamental problem that Member States are not doing what they ought to be doing , which is properly monitoring the money they pay out to beneficiaries .
Of course , the situation is particularly bad when it comes to the regional subsidies .
The clear opinion of the Court on the accounts and the lowest error rate ever for the whole budget , as disclosed by our external auditor , confirm that the Commission took the right decisions and proposed adequate measures to improve the performance of the programmes under the current financial period .
With the exception of technical assistance , which is still funded through upfront funding , this means that you will have major leveraging .
We are in a period when we are debating , and will debate a great deal more , a series of legislative proposals in the field of energy , and we often tend to concentrate too much on the large @-@ scale projects and networks , forgetting other causes in which intervention is absolutely essential .
( LT ) Assistance for energy infrastructure projects from money earmarked to stimulate the European Union economy was debated and allocated a year ago .
The sector is particularly vulnerable to the crises affecting EU agriculture as a whole , due to multiple factors : the high costs of inputs , the fall in market prices , imbalances of power in the food chain and the current increase in cereal prices .
It is crucial for the long term viability of the livestock sector overall that the Commission ensure that their actions on trade and agriculture do not compromise European farmers , but support the sustainability and viability of the European livestock sector into the future .
Incidentally , the same thing is happening in many of the EU Member States .
It is true that we no longer have the intervention stocks we had in the past , but this is because prices are higher now .
Furthermore , from today , all citizens of EU Member States , including Cyprus , Bulgaria and Romania , will also be able to travel to Taiwan without a visa .
However , due to ageing Europe , it seems that it will be quite difficult to achieve this .
The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) receives annual funding of EUR 500 million with the aim of providing financial support to workers affected by major structural changes in world trade patterns .
Had it not been for the reservations of the conservatives , the Union could have adopted more rigorous and more effective legislation .
In order to obtain this &apos; European passport &apos; from the competent EU supervisory authorities , alternative fund managers will therefore have to accept clear rules , limits to speculation and greater transparency
We owe this to the citizens of Taiwan , partly in the name of regional consistency , because we have already granted exemption from visa obligations to other countries and entities in the same geographical area with a similar level of economic development .
Improving the energy efficiency and security are major priorities for the EU .
Overall , I have a positive opinion of the joint motion for a resolution and therefore I shall vote in its favour , in the hope that it provides an impulse for increasing cooperation between these two important players in world politics and economics .
It is very important for PNR data not to be used for data mining or profiling and for data review not to simply be entrusted to an electronic system , but for decisions to be taken by people .
It is true that evaluating and processing Passenger Name Record ( PNR ) data at an international level can help in combating terrorism and organised crime . However , agreements of this kind often cause problems with regard to data protection .
It is also desirable for work to be better carried out in partnerships , as we have unique potential in terms of values , creativity and diversity .
According to the Commission &apos;s estimates , demographic changes are in danger of profoundly altering population structure and age groups .
The average birth rate in the EU is 1.5 children , one of the lowest in the world ; this can only be reversed with robust policies in support of families , which do not penalise men and women who decide to have children , in economic , tax and professional terms .
The demographic problem is making the importance of lifelong learning as a product of solidarity between the generations even more topical than ever .
I therefore supported the European Parliament &apos;s initiative aimed at simplifying the implementation of the European Union &apos;s framework programmes for research .
I welcome the draft report which intends to promote a balance between trust and control , between risk taking and risk prevention , while ensuring sound financial management .
Extremely low interest rates and too much money in search of good deals are leading to an increase in dealing and financial speculation on futures contracts , without any contact with the real economy .
I am voting for this resolution because the increasing costs of the factors of production and the costs inherent in compliance with EU regulations are currently making the profitability of European livestock farming unviable : the prices obtained by some farmers for basic meat @-@ based products are below production cost .
It is estimated that 8 000 girls fall victim to this every day .
First of all , allow me to say how pleased I am about the support once again expressed by the European Parliament &apos;s motion for a resolution in favour of regular hearings before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and , more generally , in favour of maintaining close relations with the European Central Bank .
All in all , yesterday &apos;s decisions are a critical step forward in the joint efforts to stabilise the Irish economy and thus safeguard financial stability in Europe .
Government debt is a serious problem .
Now you have sent in the IMF as the shock troops for neoliberal capitalism to make the Irish people pay .
In 2005 , on behalf of the Governing Council , I said that we were not satisfied at all by what was , at the time , the position of the Council , and what was finally accepted .
Mr President , as indicated in the Council &apos;s proposal for a directive , the minimum VAT rate has helped keep the system operating at an acceptable level .
The continued solidarity of the international community with the Haitian people remains absolutely essential .
Visiting the country with the European Parliament delegation in June , the concentration of abandoned fields , rubble which had not been removed and rubbish already gave a clear indication of how bad the situation could become .
the report by João Ferreira , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation ( EC ) No 708 / 2007 concerning the use of alien and locally absent species in aquaculture - .
These were the main concerns in drawing up the report and the proposed amendments to the Commission &apos;s original proposal .
Finally , I would just like to say that I totally agree with the rapporteur , Mr Gallagher , that splitting up a quota for a single stock of horse mackerel goes completely against scientific advice .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one minute is not long enough to cover four reports .
I would , however , like a clearer answer , Commissioner .
I also share the view that the proposals should concern the information made available by industry and not by third parties such as journalists and scientists .
When we began negotiating this proposal , we faced two problems following the election of the new Commission .
The rationale is therefore completely different , and that is why patients are the priority .
It is always the doctors &apos; responsibility and we should not regulate it here .
Without her commitment and determination , achieving a compromise between the political groups and the institutions at first reading would have been impossible .
Indeed , the ability to supply less polluting products is a very important distinguishing factor for our businesses , so much so that it can be classed as a real competitive advantage .
( EL ) Madam President , I should like to complain about the miserable behaviour on the part of the secretariat of the Committee of the Regions in connection with a photography exhibition being organised by the exiled Municipality of Kyrenia , which is presently occupied by Turkish urban troops in Cyprus .
I therefore take this opportunity to call on the British authorities to convene a coroner &apos;s court as soon as possible to establish and publicly state the circumstances and cause of death and formally identify those wanted in connection with the police investigations for murder .
The first point I would like to make , and I am not sure whether this forum is aware of it , is that , at one time , all Member States of the European Union formally committed themselves to guaranteeing freedom of the press under the framework of the Council of Europe .
The establishment of the European External Action Service is the exact expression of this priority .
Secondly , we must review our agricultural practices .
The victims of these practices , generally women , are stigmatised , rejected or even murdered by their own community in an effort to restore honour .
I firmly believe there is a real chance that we can change things .
Domestic coal will be replaced by imported coal .
Thirdly , opinions have been divided regarding the environmental and sustainability elements in Parliament &apos;s position .
Compared with the Commission &apos;s proposal , we are in favour of moving the mine closure deadline .
This position is clear , and it is not the first time that it has been expressed .
With regard to regional sustainability , in many cases , the mines are in sparsely populated areas that are entirely dependent on the industry to maintain the region , and we risk turning our lands into deserts .
This very place would not exist if , in the middle of ruins , surrounded by death and legitimate claims for revenge , brave leaders did not choose to end centuries of wars by launching the most ambitious and fascinating political experiment of our time : European unification .
I have come here to announce a new step in our policy of constructive unilateralism .
We must therefore learn a lesson from the situation .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to say that coal is a raw material which is very important for the welfare of society and energy security .
Ireland applied for assistance from the fund following heavy rain leading to severe flooding in November 2009 .
In this context , I want to point out that my country , Romania , exemplifies the spirit of solidarity in the European Union in crisis situations , whether we are talking about Greece , the Netherlands etc . , as confirmation of the fact that we are , together , one big family : the Family of a United Europe .
The EU is an area of solidarity , and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) is a part of that .
Currently , as an exception to State aid rules , the German authorities may grant State aid under the German Alcohol Monopoly for products marketed as alcohol of agricultural origin .
In this context , the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Ukraine is advantageous to both parties .
I voted in favour of this agreement as I believe that its renewal contributes to strengthening the creation of the common European Research Area , in that it serves as a catalyst for the strategic partnership between the EU and Jordan , which , by virtue of its strategic location in the Middle East , may have an impact on promoting scientific cooperation with countries in that region .
I believe that in the future Green Paper on the review of the VAT system , the Commission should not only examine the specific issue of the standard VAT rate and other rates , but also the broader issue of a new VAT strategy , including the scope of VAT and the derogations .
I would like to encourage the competent Commissioner to tackle this difficult dossier .
It is merely an attempt to clothe the bank &apos;s operations in vague and cautious phrases .
in writing . - With civil and ethnic wars gradually replacing interstate wars to dominate the scene of 21st century conflicts , the line drawn between peacekeeping and peacebuilding is increasingly blurred .
I succeeded in modifying those amendments in the final vote .
However , we voted in favour of the Gróbarczyk report , despite having misgivings about some of its content ( e.g. its suggestion that the discard system might have worked well for certain species of fish - we are opposed to the discard system completely ) .
I decided to vote for Bernhard Rapkay &apos;s report on &apos; State aid to facilitate the closure of uncompetitive coal mines &apos; .
In the long term , the funding of measures aimed at protecting the environment and the costs arising from the mine closures should be continued after 2014 .
In order to help address the Parliamentary Assembly &apos;s concerns regarding the repercussions of the current crisis on the developing world , we need to work on additional sources of financing , especially an international financial transactions tax .
In Europe , 20 % of divorces concern international couples .
A sentence corresponding with Amendment 3 would have been sufficient to defuse this conflict .
Article 67 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes the importance of respecting the different legal systems and traditions within the EU and Mr Berlinguer &apos;s report highlights this as one of the strengths of the EU .
They are all men and women who have grown up in the parliamentary tradition .
Nor does Parliament have to enforce these commitments over a longer period of time .
I would remind you , however , that we will need to be unanimous if we are to take the flexibility issue further , that this must be understood in a number of areas , and , in particular , that it must preserve the neutrality of the budget during the period in which the multiannual financial framework is in force .
As far as responsibility is concerned , we wish to give Europe a dignified budget .
We continue to be open to discussion , and the responsibility lies with those that are reluctant to engage .
I therefore call on the Parliament , Council and Commission to agree on the 2011 EU budget as soon as possible .
The current economic and financial crisis is structural and not a passing phenomenon .
We must ask ourselves what is more important : an easy short @-@ term solution , which means giving in to a number of countries and the Presidency , or a more ambitious plan , which may be more difficult but which , in the long term , will make the EU stronger and from which we really will all gain ?
You have proposed several reports based on Professor Monti &apos;s work .
Universities and schools must make a contribution to creating a smart Europe .
One final remark : the administrative burdens that weigh heavily on economic actors and , in particular , on small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , must be eliminated , and this must apply to European programmes and European funding initiatives as well .
Without doubt , work related to exiting the crisis , improving economic growth and creating jobs should be continued .
I really had to work to find at least once the word &apos; women &apos; ... in the Annex .
With that aim in mind , we will present an EU skills panorama which will not only tell us what skills employers are looking for now but will also forecast what skills will be needed in the future .
What use is it to society if people produce high levels of performance in the short term , but in the long term , turn into burnt @-@ out wrecks ?
Secondly , employees &apos; skills and qualifications must be improved continually and must satisfy the needs of the labour market .
By the end of 2012 , we want qualification and certification schemes to be in place for the installation of renewable energy facilities .
I hope this will take place as soon as possible after the adoption of the programme .
Moreover , within the framework of the planned fiscal adjustment , the choice of the mix between expenditure and revenue measures made by the Greek Government takes into account important social and economic aspects , in particular , in terms of potential complementarities with a package of structural reforms and measures to improve the micro @-@ economic environment and the functioning of the public sector .
Both President Barroso and the Vice @-@ President of the Commission and EU High Representative , Cathy Ashton , have welcomed the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo on 8 October .
I want to express my disappointment at the omission of this fundamental matter .
The outcome of these assessments shows that the administrative burden in the farming sector has been cut by 36 % , which is much more than the programme &apos;s general target of 25 % .
We object to a simplification that kills off production and producers , and we will continue to fight it in this House .
( RO ) Madam President , the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation published a report last week highlighting that mankind is perilously close to a new global food crisis .
The Commission communication - published last week - referred to the importance of simplification and of reducing red tape .
A lot of scientists in a lot of places are working on this , and the Commission could play a very powerful role in pooling that information and working out how much we know about this connected and very serious problem .
( EL ) Madam President , Commissioner , the current situation in the beekeeping sector , with mortality among bees putting the pollination of fruit , vegetables and so on - and hence our food itself - at risk , illustrates the dead @-@ end nature of actions by modern man which ignore the interactions between economic sectors and nature or are indifferent to them .
The constant decline in the bee population over a number of years sends out a clear alarm signal .
Some people claim to be disappointed that there is not more automaticity in the decision making .
This populist approach , which is corrupting our policy , is serious , and I should like to mention here that this is not the way to resolve the real and serious problems facing our countries and Europe in the world .
We in Parliament therefore have a special responsibility because we are joint decision makers in all these areas .
You know , they are beginning to understand that the game is up and yet , in their desperation to preserve their dream , they want to remove any remaining traces of democracy from the system .
It does not have to be like this , however .
That is why I trust that the Commission and the Council will do their utmost to avoid additional stages in the treatment that would unnecessarily delay the procedure .
I wonder if the time has not come , given the significant challenges that lie ahead of us , to have a major debate with our national colleagues and the European Parliament on the communitisation and pooling of our public spending .
Unanimously - and I repeat unanimously - the Heads of State or Government decided to ask for a permanent crisis mechanism with the intervention of the private sector .
We re @-@ established positive growth eleven months after the financial crisis erupted .
It will be set up by mid @-@ 2011 , with the first assessment before the next Summit in November 2011 .
( EL ) Mr President , the G20 summit in November did not , in my opinion , have substantial results .
Mr President , the reason for the anger and the noise is because we are not actually applying the rules of this place evenly .
( SK ) Mr President , I naturally voted in favour of Mr Fjellner &apos;s report , which , in addition to talking about information for patients on product leaflets and the individual packaging of medicines , mainly focuses on the behaviour of pharmaceutical companies .
Twenty years ago we could still laugh if someone bought a &apos; Rolex watch &apos; for USD 10 .
The current constitutional stalemate in the Republic of Moldova is therefore a concern that must be addressed promptly and efficiently .
in writing . - This report refers to the draft Council decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States , of the one part , and the Republic of Moldova , of the other part , on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Moldova on the general principles for the participation of the Republic of Moldova in Union programmes .
Approval of the new legislation on information on medicinal products represents a further step toward guaranteeing patients clearer and more effective information on the drugs they take and are prescribed .
Following consultation with patient organisations and healthcare professionals , among others , the Commission will adopt quality criteria for information .
This is especially a problem for those who need information in their own language .
On this point , I strongly disagree with the position and decision of the EP &apos;s and Council &apos;s majority .
I really hope this report will help to solve those problems .
I would stress the importance for European companies and jobs within the EU of protecting geographical indications , and I welcome the efforts made by the Commission to include the protection of geographical indications within the scope of ACTA .
Instead , an alternative resolution by the Christian Democrat group EPP and the Conservative group was carried .
I congratulate you , Commissioner , on the energy strategy for the next 10 years .
This is what happened in the case of the Polish contract with which the Commissioner is familiar .
Implementing this strategy is crucial , but the Treaty of Lisbon allows us to go further , opening the way to create a true energy community within Europe .
( LV ) Mr President , Commissioner , today I should like to talk briefly about the welfare of our citizens and about islands .
Where our advice is sought we provide it , but the involvement of the Member States is also required .
The rapporteur &apos;s recognition of this idea as a strategic objective is no surprise and has my full support .
I share your opinion that the ambitious two @-@ degree targets should not now be seriously questioned and a significantly lower degree figure considered , because that will make the ability to meet these targets very much more difficult and people will shy away from us .
We should be spared a repeat of last year &apos;s embarrassment , when global warmists shivered in the coldest Copenhagen December for decades .
With regard to long @-@ term financing , the EU must lay its cards on the table in the negotiations .
Expectations are therefore low , but in spite of this the Cancún Summit should be seen as an opportunity to restore confidence in the multilateral process and climate change and consolidate the Copenhagen Accord .
It could decimate our economy ; make us uncompetitive while the developing world gallops ahead .
The rich countries would have to deal with it - the developed countries .
It provides the political framework enabling its member states and regional economic communities to encourage intra @-@ African exchange and transnational infrastructure .
I am delighted that the African Union is now following a policy of zero tolerance for coups d &apos;état .
In this respect , I believe that we must keep a special place for education , training and youth mobility , in order to relaunch a new global dynamic .
It is a two @-@ way street .
The European Union cannot continue to turn a blind eye to this as if nothing were happening .
Above all - and this is essential - all parties share responsibility now for finding a just , realistic and sustainable solution , and when I say all parties , I mean Morocco , I mean the Polisario Front and also Algeria , a key symbolic player that is only mentioned in the final words of our resolution .
I very much hope that a diplomatic solution can be found here .
&apos;Fact @-@ based &apos; means deciding to trust in evidence and not mere allegations , rumours and prejudices .
Do not attempt to interrupt the work of Parliament and we will definitely exert pressure to ensure that European legal standards are met .
In order to ensure long @-@ term political stability both within the country and with neighbouring countries , it is doubtless very important for Ukraine to implement constitutional reforms , but we - the European Union and its institutions - must understand that this requires time and we must not always criticise , but help Ukraine integrate into our family .
Our responsibility today is therefore to integrate these environmental and social issues into trade .
But the question is : do we do it in a way that allows us to ensure proper application and compliance with these standards ?
The times of tough , one @-@ sided external economic aid should now be over .
I have a strong obligation to the citizens of the EU and , therefore , I cannot support this passage in the report .
Thank you very much , Mr Désir .
It should be pointed out that the Commission has accepted such withdrawals in the past and has consequently terminated investigations without taking measures .
European Ombudsman &apos;s activity report for 2009 - Special Report from the European Ombudsman to the European Parliament following the draft recommendation to the European Commission in Complaint 676 / 2008 / RT ( According to Rule 205 ( 2 ) , 1st part ) - 26th Annual Report on Monitoring the Application of European Union Law ( 2008 ) ( debate )
This guide aims to direct complainants to the body best placed to help them , whether it be my own services , the services of national or regional ombudsmen in the Member States , or problem @-@ solving mechanisms such as the cross @-@ border online network Solvit .
I am speaking on behalf of the Chair of the Committee on Petitions , who unfortunately is ill , and I would like to limit my remarks to Mrs Paliadeli &apos;s report .
More than half of the complaints relate to the European Commission .
His work is difficult enough without the added problem of a Commission that set out , as the facts here show , to impede at every turn the proper conduct of his office .
Next , I would like to thank our European Ombudsman for all the work that has been accomplished , together with his whole team , and for his accessibility and his excellent collaboration with the Committee on Petitions .
Therefore , I wish to draw a distinction between the person of the Commissioner and the Commission &apos;s institutional response to this issue , which resulted in my needing - for the first time in 15 years - to feel constrained to submit a report to this body concerning that behaviour .
In a recent discussion with Mr Diamandouros , we debated the delicate balance between institutional transparency and data protection .
A few months ago , the European Union adopted the Europe 2020 strategy , under the Spanish Presidency , which is a firm commitment to an integrative society based on knowledge and innovation .
This part remains unchanged .
In this way , we will protect jobs , the economy and the environment at the same time and find simultaneous answers to the major challenges we are facing in Europe .
In view of the current budgetary constraints , Parliament ultimately decided to agree to scale back this increase to 2.91 % , provided that certain political conditions were met ( debate on the granting of own resources to the European Union with a view to ending the horse trading between Member States , budget flexibility and funding for key strategic priorities ) .
Given that the Council &apos;s position on the draft budget has limited payment appropriations to an amount that represents an increase of 2.91 % over the 2010 budget , and that on 15 November 2010 , the Parliament @-@ Council Conciliation Committee failed to agree on a joint text for the 2011 budget , I am voting in favour of the resolution as I agree with the conditions that Parliament is imposing on the Council and the Commission in order to facilitate an agreement on the 2011 budget .
EU trade agreements must include strong human rights , social and environmental standards .
My vote supports the work done by the Ombudsman , who resolves numerous complaints through mutually agreed solutions , in cooperation with Parliament .
I voted for this resolution because in their present form , the Commission &apos;s annual reports &apos; on monitoring the application of European Union law &apos; do not give citizens or the other institutions sufficient information about the true state of application of EU law .
I would like to highlight the need for the Member States to address the digital divide between urban and rural zones and to ensure that , with digitisation , all individuals in all regions have equal access to public service broadcasting , along with offering attractive , quality content to appeal to young people who access the media .
In particular , the time has come to go a step further and recognise that women suffer different traumas and also experience certain situations and suffer certain constraints rather more intensely than men do on average .
The sector cannot , however , continue to produce such results if the European Union does not help to fund it , in conjunction with national , regional and local authorities .
Within the next decade , major investments will be needed in the internal energy sector , notably in new power plants , interconnections and grids , given that these investments will shape the energy mix for an even longer period , contributing to the creation of a sustainable and clean energy market .
This will not only allow a reduction in emissions of harmful substances , but may also effectively limit the dependence of the EU market on foreign supplies of energy .
For example , on the 2020 objectives concerning energy efficiency and the 20 % renewable energy rate , the numbers do not add up .
That is why I voted against the resolution .
There must therefore be an independent international investigation under the auspices of the UN to explain the deaths and disappearances of civilians .
Parliament calls on the Commission and the Council to draft an action plan on establishing visa @-@ free travel for Ukraine .
I voted for this report because it identifies strategic objectives and stages the European Union could continue to follow as it seeks a better agreement on climate change .
The European Union should invest more in new technologies , and not in activities which only serve financial speculation .
In view of this , I would also like to stress my support for a Trade and Decent Work Committee within the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) , which would provide a forum for the discussion of issues including labour standards , especially as they relate to the employment of children , and CSR , as it relates to international trade .
In Iraq , a religious community that has lived there much longer than the extremists have is being driven away in a very brutal fashion .
Most Iraqi Assyrians are now internally displaced people .
The Chinese authorities should also allow access to Tibet by foreign media without the need for special permits and allow uncensored communications and access to information - also on the Internet - throughout the entire country .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the abrogation of the bilingual system in Tibet is an illiberal act that runs counter to respect for the cultural identity of a minority and respect for human rights .
on behalf of the S &amp; D Group . - Madam President , I am delighted at the level of European Union unity that has been shown on the matter of Burma .
Adjournment of the session
I would like to thank Mrs Rosa Brignone , Head of Unit for Equal Opportunities and Diversity , for providing employment for 61 people with disabilities at the European Parliament .
( GA ) Mr President , the European Union has had an important role in the promotion of the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland and in the country &apos;s border regions .
There is a basis for continued work , but we must also recognise that this basis , while positive , remains founded on promises .
Particularly important elements are that it applies on a reciprocal basis to EU citizens also , as they are currently under a visa obligation for travelling to Russia .
We should unambiguously and gladly welcome any way of showing Georgian society that the strength of these changes is being reflected in our reactions as European Union institutions .
It is nothing short of a humiliation for millions of people - the people who stand in those queues .
As I said earlier in this debate , there will be an evaluation at the beginning of next year and I will be happy to come to Parliament and to discuss its conclusions and how we can move further in facilitating these kinds of agreements with third countries .
As Frontex does not have permanent representatives outside Union territory , there is no longer any doubt about how important such cooperation has become .
We need a meaningful exchange of information and best practice , and we also need to avoid having duplicate structures .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mrs Mathieu , ladies and gentlemen , immigration in Europe is undoubtedly a highly important and hugely significant political , economic and social issue .
Nevertheless , at the same time , we also recognise that one of the tools that can be used to combat illegal immigration is to provide good and clear opportunities for regularised immigration , just as we are doing in this case .
Allow me to make a comment on the legal nature of the supplementary document .
I would like to say that tomorrow , we are actually voting at first reading .
He entered the European Union via Greece and travelled on to the Netherlands , where he would have preferred to stay , because he had some contacts there , but he was sent back to Greece .
Here it is a matter of using other funding to continue to improve the interfaces and to prevent unnecessary overlaps .
What I should like to stress is that , if we take account of the future direction of cohesion policy , at least as it would appear up to a degree in the fifth cohesion report , multi @-@ level governance in both its horizontal and vertical dimension will be instrumental to the viability of any development initiative and to the success of the policy .
For this reason , I believe that we as Parliament have to make it quite clear from the start that the regions must not be allowed to be weakened relative to the Member States .
This is why I want to tell you that the report enjoys majority support at the moment .
It can be the best of things because advertising is also an amazing tool for economic development .
Many of the targeting techniques - display , contextual and certain search @-@ related adverts , etc . - do not involve any tracking and are not a subject of major concern .
Furthermore , we aim to introduce targeted improvements to the existing rules regarding investor protection .
In conclusion , I would like to thank the rapporteur for being responsive to our comments , and for the fact that the report also contains the explicit reference we requested to the fight against poverty and social exclusion in the section mentioning the activities necessary for the protection of fundamental rights .
We currently have a community of values and principles , reflected in a complex system of human rights protection , which includes the Charter of Fundamental Rights , the most progressive regional code of human rights .
In absolute terms , that is to say , for all other cases , jurisdiction lies with the national courts .
We would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for the work that it has done , along with all the shadow rapporteurs and our team .
The text being presented to us today is an extremely important text , and I once again extend my congratulations .
You said during your previous appearance that we had not realised the significance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
This is , indeed , a good Christmas present .
The report , as tabled , provides for the careful protection of victims , with the aim of eradicating the phenomenon .
Organised crime networks take advantage of social vulnerability , family difficulties , domestic violence and disabilities to favour immigration , exploiting the people involved through the use of force , abuse and threats .
Unfortunately , often human trafficking is linked to sexualised practices : women and girls end up as prostitutes or they are forced into it .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Mr President , you will not blame me , following this discussion which was not completely clear , for taking the outcome of this discussion home to Brussels .
Since 2008 , 35 people have been rescued from exploitation in my own constituency of Northern Ireland ; 25 of these were rescued in 2009 .
I voted for the mobilisation of the European Solidarity Fund .
in writing . - I voted for this report which approves the transfer of 66 million euro from the European offshore wind grid system to the EU Solidarity Fund in order to help the victims of flooding in Portugal and storms in France .
I therefore voted in favour of this resolution , in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will help these workers successfully rejoin the labour market .
I am voting in favour of the report , as assistance amounting to EUR 633 077 for 1 104 redundant Polish workers from enterprises operating in NACE Revision 2 Division 29 is fully justified .
I therefore voted in favour of this resolution , in the hope that the mobilisation of the EGF will help these workers successfully rejoin the labour market .
Given that Poland has requested assistance in respect of 189 redundancies at H. Cegielski @-@ Poznań and at four of its suppliers , all operating in the marine diesel engine sector , I voted in favour of the resolution , as I agree with the Commission &apos;s proposal combined with the respective amendments introduced by Parliament .
Extension of the area of application to include refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection can only serve to burden the public purse even more .
Quite apart from the opportunities for abuse of the system that visa liberalisation would open up , this logic needs to be turned on its head : no visa negotiations until all of the necessary reforms have been implemented .
In addition , I agree with Mrs Zanicchi that it is high time we recognised the political importance of reinforcing the EU disaster response capability and that all means should be mobilised to achieve this objective .
In my opinion , regulators need to ensure that they can , at any time , recreate every detail of the trade in order to understand the market dynamics and the participants &apos; involvement .
Finally , European quality and security standards should also be adopted .
For this same reason , I consider it crucial to strengthen the Commission &apos;s control procedures relating to the application and usage of the Cohesion Fund , reinforcing the mechanisms of good governance .
The creation of networks would not only help to regulate legal , irregular and illegal immigration , but would also facilitate operational cooperation between the Member States and expedite the system for the presentation of the half @-@ yearly reports .
in writing . - I have voted in favour of Amendments 30 , 34 , 65 , 103 , 109 and 114 because although I fully support the UN International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families , I believe that regulation of access to labour markets , social security schemes and public housing are matters to be regulated by the Member States which should not be regulated at Community level .
As we were dissatisfied with the text and would have preferred the proposal to go to a second reading before it was adopted , we voted for the inclusion of correlation tables , against the wishes of the Council .
The ECR Group is sympathetic to the distress that physical , psychological and or sexual abuse can cause and the state of vulnerability in which it leaves its victims .
This proposal was for the EU to decide minimum sentences in Member States for a crime , and that is simply not a matter for the EU .
There was an urgent need , therefore , to plug the legal gap that exists in some European countries , such as Spain , where , incidentally , the largest brothel has just opened a few kilometres from the French border .
I voted in favour of the resolution as I believe that it is essential for there to be a coordinated and consolidated European Union strategy against human trafficking .
This sums up in a nutshell the major plan for investing EUR 1 000 billion that I have been calling for since the beginning of the current term of office and which is an essential condition for our continent &apos;s development through competitiveness and for equal opportunities for European citizens wherever they are in the Union .
The rapporteur calls on the European Commission to submit concrete proposals for defining and implementing consistently the objective of territorial cohesion , emphasising the importance of the principle of decentralisation down to local authority level ( the &apos; bottom @-@ up &apos; approach ) , with a view to improving the level of absorption of funds ( it is counterproductive that regions administer , on average , only 30.5 % of the overall budget allocated to the cohesion policy , with the remainder being administered by central governments ) .
You can come forward with a proposal on Eurobonds , and that was what Mr Schulz was asking .
I am sure you would not be in favour of a European unified state .
( EL ) Mr President , a real war is being waged in cyberspace at the moment .
Frankly , there has been no result .
It has also accepted the restrictions that the Council imposed quite strictly , particularly with regard to payment appropriations .
I have to say to you , however , that I considered this provocation necessary .
The Treaty of Lisbon does not preclude a new agreement with the same content as the current one ; rather , it is a question of the political will of the Member States .
Voting in favour of a 2.9 % increase in the current climate would be totally inappropriate .
Mr President , from what the previous speakers have said , it is clear that we are all pleased that it will be possible to implement the 2011 EU budget efficiently and without unnecessary delays as of 1 January next year .
The legislation will grant it all the supervisory powers deemed necessary to force rating agencies to comply with the terms of the regulation .
I am therefore convinced that it is incorrect to accept that credit rating agencies are not responsible for the ratings they give .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
I would particularly like to thank the Chair of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , Jo Leinen .
Among other things , I think that the creation of a committee and a technology network to promote technological cooperation is extremely important .
( HU ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although Cancún in itself does not yet represent a turning point , without it , we would not have the chance to reach a turning point one year from now in Durban .
Mr President , I would congratulate the President of the Cancún conference on the transparent negotiations during such a complex process .
On 23 June 2010 , the European Parliament adopted a resolution &apos; setting up a European early warning system ( EWS ) for paedophiles and sex offenders &apos; .
However , in order to combat this glass ceiling , targeted action is required now .
I think that is a basic human right and we should consider the cost to society of not putting this basic human right into practice .
The Commission has repeatedly stressed the need for a strict enforcement of the rule of law and for full respect of human rights , notably the protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .
We want to produce these by February or March .
There are currently no common definitions of energy poverty , nor are there any proper political initiatives in place to reduce it .
The conclusion is very clear in the report . We need binding energy efficiency targets as soon as possible , and this is important for a whole host of reasons : economic reasons and reasons relating to competition , jobs , the environment and the climate .
In addition , the capital that is freed up as a result of the lower power bills releases a major potential for consumption which , furthermore , can contribute to our economic growth in the long term .
Binding targets mean only unnecessary and very often ineffective expenditure ; it is better to convince citizens , institutions and bodies that savings in this area have a bearing on people &apos;s security and quality of life , too .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
As I am sure you can imagine , I am very satisfied with this result .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on achieving full support in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , and I would like to thank her for negotiating a consistent position with the Council .
It is about the right regulatory framework , which means getting everybody in the supply chain to understand their responsibilities .
It is eighteen months today since we had a new directive ; and yet , here we are again today , like last year , as the Chair quite rightly pointed out , talking about the same subject , the safety of toys , and this year , things are even more serious , because we have a recession and , in a recession , parents who want to buy toys and are short of money will go to the section of the market that sells sub @-@ standard toys .
The country has made progress in meeting the political criteria set by the Copenhagen European Council and the requirements of the stabilisation and association process .
I believe that we must continue , together , in this direction and that the Heads of State or Government must follow us .
( Applause )
Having said that , it should still be possible to have some non @-@ euro @-@ area Member States associated in a support operation via bilateral contributions , as already applies today , in the case of Ireland , to the United Kingdom , Sweden and Denmark .
This is an oversimplification that must be avoided .
It is time for you to act in the interest of the citizens of Europe and in the interest of the Member States , so that we can find our way back to a sensible path of growth .
The euro &apos;s value against the US dollar has , throughout , to all practical purposes , remained higher than it was when the European currency was established .
( DE ) Madam President , I wanted to ask Mr Hökmark , as he has been here for some time , whether he remembers that Belgium , Greece and Italy had debts amounting to more than 130 % of their national product at the start of the monetary union and that the figure in Greece has risen , while in Belgium and Italy it has fallen by more than 30 % and more than 25 % respectively .
( The President cut off the speaker )
These are indeed necessary for increasing our potential growth and for creating sustainable employment .
These goals are not achieved by sanctions and imposed austerity measures .
I would like to thank everyone involved , including the employees , the secretariats , the co @-@ rapporteurs , the Commission and the Council , for working together so effectively . I believe that this type of cooperation across committee and group boundaries could be a model for the future .
I therefore believe that we have completed the circle , Madam President .
Indeed , this instrument is designed to promote in @-@ depth debate throughout civil society .
I believe that two things will be very important over the next few months . One is creating access , including digital access , to the citizens &apos; initiative over the Internet in a way which makes it easy to use but is also secure .
The citizens &apos; initiative that we , in the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , are on the point of enthusiastically adopting is a major step forward from the Treaty of Lisbon .
Such bodies could get involved in the process in the capacity of organisers or supporters ; after all they are closest to the citizens of the EU .
This is something which is very important .
We should not have been asking for an increase , we should not even have been asking for a freeze , we should have been asking for a cut in the EU budget so that taxpayers across the European Union can take their politicians seriously and know that we understand the pain that they are feeling at this time and that we share the pain with them , rather than looking like an elected elite who pay no attention to the people who put us there .
Instead of granting ever more aid , we need to put our energy into combating illicit capital flight , amongst other things , which is something that this resolution has highlighted anyway .
Stop using Batman , Spiderman and Bamse against our children .
Adapting the financial framework to the proposals in the report would not increase the flexibility of the Union , but would restrict it .
Despite the concessions made by Parliament , some Member States who , unlike me , do not believe in the added value of the European budget , have remained inflexible .
in writing . - ( DE ) I have voted in favour of the report .
Indeed , as well as the legal uncertainty over the identification of the laws applicable in each individual case , there may also be a &apos; rush to court &apos; to ensure that the proceeding is governed by a given law which better protects one of the two spouses .
After numerous initiatives in this area have been vetoed by individual Member States , the enhanced cooperation procedure has now given at least 14 countries the opportunity to put in place the necessary criteria .
As they form part of a highly complex system of financial markets , the decision was made to introduce a double system for this purpose .
This is the right approach to achieving a simpler and leaner Europe .
The joint work by the two co @-@ rapporteurs showed that even ideological divisions can be overcome when work is carried out effectively and in the interests of citizens .
In Portugal &apos;s case , at least 16 500 signatories will be required to support an initiative .
There is now nothing to stop citizens from participating directly in the functioning of the EU .
We voted against the European Parliament &apos;s draft resolution on the European Commission &apos;s working programme for 2011 because , on the basic issues , it supports its own positions and ignores the real need for a break with the neoliberal , militarist and antisocial policies that the European Commission favours .
I voted in favour of the resolution on the future of the Africa @-@ EU Strategic Partnership during the period preceding the 3rd Africa @-@ EU Summit because I believe that the partnership established between the two continents three years ago , during the Portuguese Presidency of the EU , should continue to be strengthened , so that together , we can face common challenges and promote sustainable development , peace and human rights .
It needs to be ensured that all new legislative proposals conform to the Charter and , by the same logic , that all instruments already in place are checked .
With the rapid evolution of advertising technologies and the spread of advertising via the internet , mobile telephones and social networks , it is necessary to take effective measures to protect the consumer from the impact of unwanted and misleading advertising .
Through the appropriate means we must ensure that media and advertising professionals respect human dignity and oppose direct or indirect discrimination or stereotypical depictions .
Within this framework of possible action , it is suggested that major incentives are created for regions , which , up to now , have had an above @-@ average role with regard to energy efficiency , promoting their energy independence and , on the other hand , encouraging the sharing of good practice between these regions and those having had little development in this area .
The jobs created will be in both rural and urban areas .
in writing . - This report is a powerful and timely reminder to the Commission and the Council of the importance of a binding energy @-@ saving target ahead of the crucial Energy Summit on 4 February 2011 and as the Commission prepares its energy efficiency action plan .
The Council also recalled that it intended to contribute both to thematic monitoring , based on the five key objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy , and to macroeconomic monitoring , since both these frameworks are closely linked .
It is obliged to do so under the Treaty of Lisbon .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy . - Madam President , honourable Members , on Friday we celebrated International Human Rights Day .
I think we should give them not only a feeling of solidarity , but a guarantee of security for the future , so that they have the feeling they have someone to whom they can appeal for help .
In this context , the increasing persecution of Christian minorities in the Middle East and the cases of discrimination and intolerance of Christians in Europe are highly disturbing .
( PL ) Madam President , I am pleased by two things .
I am pleased , too , that the report also reflects the restricted freedom of access to the Internet , and the fact that Belarus is a kind of shameful leader in this field in Europe .
Zero , nil , nothing !
Aid distribution and the use of private contractors need to be rethought so that they benefit the local population - and certainly without paying protection money to local insurgents for the supply routes .
There are no easy solutions or prescriptions , but we urge everyone to be aware that the only solution is a political solution , one which emphasises a strong engagement with Afghan institutions and citizens in their country &apos;s development which will have an effect over the long term by creating stable prerequisites for halting opium production and eliminating poverty .
This is similar to all that has happened in these ill @-@ fated ten years of war in Afghanistan .
I very much look forward to continuing the discussion on the key points at issue in that report and beyond .
It is also essential to be able to continue to work effectively to support the Member States and the allies to develop critical military capabilities , building on the successful work we have launched already .
It seems that there are opposing views on this among the Member States .
The cost of eradicating poverty in Afghanistan is equal to the cost of five days &apos; war .
Only under conditions of much closer and more determined transatlantic cooperation will the EU and NATO be able to set a democratic international agenda over the next decade against the challenges of a multilateral world .
The results were proclaimed by the Independent Electoral Commission and certified by the special representative of the UN Secretary @-@ General .
My question to Baroness Ashton is &apos; What steps do you intend to take if the situation were to degenerate and the use of force were to threaten both the Ivorian citizens and the expatriates living in Côte d &apos;Ivoire ?
However this committee will be a normal comitology committee chaired by the Commission and subject to the same rules ; only qualified majority against the Commission &apos;s draft can then prevent the Commission from adopting it .
Allow me to react to some of the comments .
It should not be seen as a simple transformation of the intergovernmental initiative , but rather as a real tool which , based on experience , will bring real added value , both through the impetus it may give to the promotion of European values by Member States or local authorities and in terms of our citizens &apos; knowledge of these values .
( RO ) Mr President , today , 16 December , we celebrate the 240th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven &apos;s birth , the composer of the united Europe &apos;s anthem .
The foundations of a strong Union and a successful future are built on trust and mutual accommodation , just like in a family .
The agreement will remain in place until one of the parties pulls out .
I believe that it will be very interesting for the young people of the European Union and Switzerland to get to know each other better , and I am sure that this will lay foundations that will also have an influence on the future of the European Union .
Today , the import of shell eggs is very limited due to the short shelf life of the product as well as EU food safety requirements .
Do any of these countries have a reputation for high welfare standards ?
I therefore call on the Commission to assess the feasibility of maintaining the ban on the use of conventional cages from 1 January 2012 while also finding solutions and clearly defined criteria for those producers who will not complete the modernisation process by 1 January 2012 , as referred to in two amendments supported by my group .
Mr President , I know it is quite unorthodox to take the floor after the Commissioner has spoken .
Moreover , this will not cost us taxpayers in the European Union anything , as Switzerland is itself paying for its involvement .
This demonstrates once again that the EU is rooted in strong values such as freedom , democracy , respect for human rights , cultural diversity , tolerance and solidarity .
The agreement between the Commission and Switzerland is adequate , given that Swiss participants in these programmes apply on an equal footing with all other young Europeans , and that Switzerland is committed to adapting to European rules and their supervision , as well as to contributing to both programmes financially .
This annual report aims to emphasise the European Parliament &apos;s strong determination and long @-@ term efforts to defend human rights and democracy in the world through the development of an increasingly integrated and effective European policy capable of guaranteeing greater coherence and consistency across all policy areas , whether through bilateral relations with third countries or through supporting international and local civil @-@ society organisations .
Nine years after the start of the military intervention in Afghanistan , it is possibly the greatest challenge faced by Europe and its allies in terms of foreign intervention and global security .
I feel that in light of the specificity and political sensitivity of implementing acts to be adopted under the external financial assistance instruments , and in line with the practice established with the democratic scrutiny dialogue , Parliament should have the opportunity to contribute to the process leading to the definition of the content of the draft implementing acts to be adopted under the external financial assistance instruments .
This decision must be overturned because otherwise , this country will be unable to break free from the political deadlock that followed the elections and the instances of violence already being reported will increase .
According to recent surveys , it is thought that 30 % of European farms still use unenriched cages .
What is , however , problematic in the case of Malaysia is the fact that a more significant number of crimes and offences attract a caning sentence : to be more precise , 66 in Malaysia , compared with 30 in Singapore .
No , they are human rights , they are universal values , and we really do want these universal values to be strongly defended by the Commission and by the entire European Union .
What is truly horrific , and some of my fellow Members have already expanded on this , is the anti @-@ gay campaign that is taking place in this country .
We were not permitted to include that proposal in this resolution .
Vice @-@ versa , by coordinating this amendment with the intervention of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , it will be the latter that will assess this .
He is awaiting the decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court and the Supreme Court is currently not in session during the southern hemisphere &apos;s summer holiday .
All of this is not solely in the interest of these countries but is , above all , in the interest of Europe .
This item is closed .
I would like to mention one further point that was important in the debate regarding whether or not we should vote in favour .
But let me start with the facts of the incident first : the incident came to light when a compound feed manufacturer notified the German competent authorities on 22 December 2010 after having received the analytical result from a laboratory that a sample was found to be non @-@ compliant with EU legislation after self @-@ controlled tests .
I think the word &apos; criminal &apos; has been mentioned here and there are those with criminal intent who have been involved in this .
( PL ) Madam President , we are dealing with a scandal , but calling it a scandal is putting it too mildly .
No farmer who is inspected several times a year can understand the current practice with regard to checks on large animal feed producers .
We also need to strengthen our rules and regulations .
First and foremost , the danger - it is not the intention , but there is a danger - of agreeing such a framework is that it is seen as providing a framework for large @-@ scale exploitation of our forests , leading to the opposite of the purpose of the agreement , namely , further degradation and further deforestation , thus contributing to the very destruction of the global environment we are trying to avoid .
In this context , I think that it is important to set up a structure promoting the active involvement of local communities , with a view both to monitoring the agreement &apos;s implementation and improving the forest governance framework and , last but not least , in order to prevent corruption as much as possible .
Commitment is the starting point and I look on this process as a very positive one .
The Commission will , in any event , closely monitor the implementation of the derogation and will report to Parliament on the basis of a study which will be prepared before the end of 2011 .
If not , the situation is hopeless .
International adoption in the European Union ( debate )
Therefore , the first step is to provide appropriate care for these children .
However , we must also add the possibility for greater cooperation between the Member States for collaboration in international adoptions , as well as supervision in relation to the protection of adopted children , obviously .
I have five points to make in summing up the debate .
Let us establish a broad inter @-@ faith dialogue under the auspices of the EU .
( HU ) ( the speaker &apos;s microphone was switched off and the beginning of the sentence is inaudible ) ... extraordinary meeting of the Commission .
On 8 December , the Commission adopted a Communication on this .
For instance , let me ask one question with regard to Hungary : how is it possible that we are talking about childhood starvation in a country with exceptional agricultural resources ?
The greatly fluctuating market prices in the agricultural sector are the result of crop failures , speculation and a concentration in trade , and these are significant uncertainty factors .
The agreement strengthens the already close ties between the European Union and Serbia , and creates a contractual relationship between the two parties .
Madam President , as a liberal , I must stress that the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is a group which has always supported the enlargement process because we believe in a Europe comprising all its members , namely , a powerful , united Europe .
Serbia , therefore , must be part of the political map of Europe , so let us not search for pretexts to prolong Serbia &apos;s path to the European Union .
It should not matter on which side of a border citizens live , regardless of their ethnicity : whether they are in Niš or in Kalotina , in Caribrod or in Sofia , in Priština or in Leskovac , European integration is the only way to stability , security and prosperity , for Serbian citizens as well as their neighbours .
To Mr Belder firstly , on the Sandžak , I would rather talk about a politicisation of the issue of Muslim representation than a surge of radical Islamism .
However , countering the symptoms that have been in evidence so far is not enough .
I see in it the strength of our Union and the proper functioning of our institutions .
And the third issue , which has already been mentioned , is the Citizens &apos; Initiative .
You have taken the lead in making clear that this Parliament supports the Commission in wanting to see correlation tables included in all future legislation .
I would like to mention a few matters that have not been resolved during your Presidency , on which I hope that you will pass on your pro @-@ European , humanist spirit to the Hungarian Presidency , because a lot is at stake for the future of Europe .
Mr Leterme reminded us of the dream that guided the founders of the European project in addition to the single market , and Mr Barroso highlighted the importance of European spirit .
The country was mainly preoccupied - and what is more , unsuccessfully so - with forming a new government , while the quarrelling between the Flemings and the Walloons has rendered the country unable to make political decisions .
The external action of the European Union is provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon ; it should reflect the Union &apos;s political weight and influence as the main international donor .
A modern , liberal and efficient economy - as I believe ours must be - needs a specific law on mergers but only if , like the directive proposed today , it is streamlined and non @-@ interfering , and protects the freedoms and rights of the people who could be hurt by these operations .
It will re @-@ establish legal certainty for bilateral air services agreements concluded between Member States of the WAEMU and EU Member States and it will also make it possible for EU Member States that have not signed a bilateral agreement with a Member State of the WAEMU not to be adversely affected .
The sector employs directly 12 million EU citizens with 26 million workers dependent on the sector .
This proposal for a regulation lays down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products , through the introduction of common rules on marking , aimed at strengthening the guarantees relating to product safety and reliability and , at the same time , at reducing costs for producers , with particular reference to SMEs .
I voted in favour of this report because the European Union is the world &apos;s largest donor of humanitarian aid , contributing more than 40 % of all official international humanitarian assistance .
For my part , I shall continue to support this modus vivendi , including within the Committee on Budgets , of which I am a member , and to support any measures designed to increase the financial assistance given to those activities that are more specifically aimed at safeguarding these important rights , so that the European Union continues its efforts to assist and support the sections of the population that need it most .
Europe can contribute to global food security by becoming more competitive .
The FAO Food Price Index of 55 basic foodstuffs has increased for the sixth consecutive month to 214.7 points , higher than the previous historic high of 213.5 points in June 2008 .
Worse still , authorisations of genetically modified varieties are emerging .
On the whole , this report is a fairly worthwhile contribution to the debate on the role of agriculture in food supply .
As you know , some of them are already undertaking important labour market reforms .
The Commission has absolutely no influence over its methods or audit priorities , nor would we seek to have that kind of influence .
If not , we will at least propose binding legislation .
Two infringement procedures have been launched with regard to these incentives and , despite formal legislative intervention , in Italy , waste incineration is still being encouraged as a source of renewable energy , with the Acerra case being just one example of this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Hungarian Presidency is committed to the Council adopting this law as soon as possible .
As people have said , for many patients , this will work well , but we also need to take care of our patients in our own Member States .
The ability for Member States and regional pairs to have the capacity to decide on eligible treatments with prior authorisation and a setting of a cap on reimbursements will go some way in alleviating concerns about the already overstretched and burdened healthcare systems .
This is not an issue that we need to concern ourselves with .
( The President cut off the speaker )
We want our citizens to get the best treatment they can get at home .
the report by Mrs Matias , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , on a European initiative on Alzheimer &apos;s disease and other dementias , and
Inequalities exist between Member States with regard to prevention , access to treatment and care .
I am pleased that we have the opportunity to talk about it , because the Committee on Petitions has been dealing with this petition for some considerable time .
Many of you have already mentioned that 85 % of public investment in research is nowadays made without any European coordination and this inevitably leads to fragmentation and duplication .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by expressing my gratitude for all the words that have been said about the report that Parliament is tabling on Alzheimer &apos;s and other dementias .
Any support for productive investment has to be seen in that context .
Subject : Additional support measures for SMEs under tourism policy
( LT ) Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your really comprehensive response .
Will people be informed if this service is not available in their country or in the country they are visiting ?
Member of the Commission . - Madam President , may I also join you in expressing sympathy to those affected and their families .
on behalf of the ECR Group . - Madam President , it is good to have this debate again ; we had one recently .
We must not , however , subcontract all public services to NGOs .
Madam President , they say that God helps those who help themselves , but the European Union actually goes further , because the European Union helps those who do not help themselves , particularly in relation to Haiti where the government - as Mr Deva and others have pointed out - is corrupt and does not seem to be concerned about its own people .
It was a very helpful and encouraging debate and I believe that we will try to deliver on the issues that you have mentioned today .
Secondly , after the official notification to Italy of the opening of the infringement procedure for waste management on 29 June 2007 , the Commission informed the Italian authorities that no further cofinancing would be acceptable for waste management .
The people who are really to blame for what happened in the past should be punished .
However , for this purpose , the waste has to be selected at the very beginning .
To conclude , I would like to reiterate the Commission &apos;s strong commitment to combating homophobia and discrimination based on sexual orientation , to the full extent of the powers conferred by the treaties .
We should certainly show more confidence in the legislative process in Lithuania and more understanding for those members of the Lithuanian Parliament who are actually pointing out that children and young people in particular should be better protected against frequently aggressive exposure to material with a sexual content .
The President of the Central Bank was also present and a statement by the Heads of State or Government of the eurozone and the EU institutions present was welcomed by the European Council .
Thank you for your attention .
Mr Barroso and Mr Van Rompuy , tell me this morning - because you have not done so yet - about the morality of transferring tens of billions of euro of private bad debts by speculators and bankers gambled wildly on the Irish property market and placing those debts on the shoulders of the Irish people who carry no responsibility whatsoever for them .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , a law has been passed in the United States requiring the Federal Reserve to detail how much of the USD 3 300 billion rescue package has gone to which banks .
The task we have in front of us is extremely difficult .
The first stemmed from the fact that we had to make everything up on the spot and the second relates to the need - because we live in a democracy - for consensus among our 27 Member States , our 27 democracies .
However , I am convinced that this is exactly what the citizens of Europe expect us to do .
The Commission welcomes the Presidency &apos;s commitment to this strategy .
( Heckling )
I am not merely referring to the media law here ; there are nine other elephants in the room .
Unfortunately , as the current debate has also shown , the beginnings of the Hungarian Presidency are turbulent .
I think that this is an approach which is correct , honest , open and fair to everyone involved .
The issues we face so far are a consolidation or monopoly of supply and transit , lack of an interconnected single market and particular vulnerability on the Union &apos;s eastern flank .
( SL ) Mr President , I would like to address a few words of encouragement to , and support for , the Hungarian Presidency and Hungary , a country which is a good neighbour of Slovenia &apos;s and one with which we have many things in common .
This is not a matter of media laws !
Furthermore , even more efforts will need to be made for the crisis to be overcome fully , and therefore I agree with the priorities set by Hungary on European economic stabilisation and the issues of EU enlargement , energy and Roma integration .
Amateur sport is passed over in public debate and social research , and the role it plays in preventing disease and improving Europeans &apos; living conditions and quality of life is underestimated .
Oral explanations of vote
I hope that the same thing will not happen in future in the field of healthcare services .
I firmly believe , however , that Serbia must continue to strengthen democracy and the legal state , put greater effort into reforming the judiciary and public administration , applying the principles of justice , while strengthening administrative and judicial structures overall .
As far as the protection of minors from the harmful effects of public information is concerned , the European Parliament , too , decided recently that the various types of advertising that have been spreading via the new communications media in recent years have become a social phenomenon .
This will enable those who suffer from them to benefit from the advantages of closer cooperation in healthcare between Member States .
Above all , it clarifies the rules that will apply ; patients will be able to access more information ( in particular , via contact points ) about their rights or about reimbursement .
Patients will then be able to apply to be reimbursed for the cost of their treatment , which will be based on the level of costs that would have been assumed for the same treatment in their Member State of affiliation .
I cannot support such a concept of healthcare .
The rapporteur himself realises the weaknesses of the agreement , setting out a long list of concerns that it does not explicitly address .
This Voluntary Partnership Agreement should help tackle corruption and significantly reduce the trade in illegal timber .
While the interim agreement includes specific provisions on the rules of origin for fishery products , it was important to manage this derogation .
The agreement covers rules of origin in relation to fisheries , textiles and agriculture , leading to investment and employment opportunities .
In the absence of European legislation in this area , the European Union should do everything in its power to facilitate these adoptions , in particular , by allowing , in the months to come , mutual recognition of civil status documents and adoption decisions .
I hope that Serbia persists with opting for the EU , and I must congratulate its people and their leaders for the progress that they have made in this regard .
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement , signed in 2008 , provides for the establishment of a free trade area between the EU and Serbia and offers a prospect of this country &apos;s accession to the EU .
Once these fundamental steps have been taken , integrated action is required , ranging from research to healthcare provision .
I must also emphasise that it is important to take into account the specific needs of women , who account for twice the number of sufferers and a disproportionate number of carers in the areas of medical and social research , health and social policies .
In view of the above , it is a matter of fundamental importance that prevention be placed at the centre of all strategies , and that efforts be made to ensure that diagnoses are made as early as possible .
As far as I am concerned , it does it well : all that is missing is a greater tendency towards involving local communities and associations in distribution , and in seeking solutions for the future .
A recent EU Fundamental Rights Agency report concludes that &apos; The amendments could potentially criminalise almost any public expression or portrayal of , or information about , homosexuality &apos; .
Honourable Members , I am fully committed to keeping freedom of religion or belief at the top of our agenda .
( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to offer the Commissioner my heartfelt thanks for the content of her speech , because the purpose of our resolution here is to ensure greater protection for religious minorities in everyone &apos;s interest .
There is , therefore , no alternative to dialogue and mutual respect .
We cannot let terrorists use religion as a tool of barbarity .
Mr President , the plight of Christians in the Middle East , Asia and Africa is no accident .
As I have already indicated , part of the reason I was very pleased to be able to participate in this debate is that this has been raised once before with the Foreign Affairs Council - but we will come back to it at the end of January - and the concerns that honourable Members have made have resonated and echoed with the concerns which have been raised with me from a variety of different sources , not least from some of the Member States and some of the ministers who have been most concerned about these issues .
There are initiatives already in place of course , via the tenth European Development Fund ( EDF ) in particular , and almost EUR 2 billion have been set aside for these countries for combating poverty , developing the economy and establishing more effective governance .
I would first of all like to express my regret at the recent murder of two young French people in Niger at the hands of terrorists , not forgetting the Nigerien soldiers who died during the rescue operation .
I know that the European Parliament has scope to provide scholarships for students expelled from university and I hope , Mr President , that this facility can be exploited .
It is precisely this dependent relationship that demands a greater European involvement in Belarus &apos;s civil society .
But I do say that this is not simply a watershed moment for democracy and human rights in Belarus : it is a test of Europe &apos;s own Neighbourhood Policy .
They all turned on their radios and listened to Radio Free Europe or Voice of America or the BBC , to find out the truth about what was happening in Poland .
Experts from both sides meet very regularly to ensure that we can reach agreement on these two issues as soon as possible but , of course , there are difficult political issues .
Libya puts pressure on London and Edinburgh .
A way has to be found to live with one &apos;s neighbour , though it does not necessarily mean agreeing with their way of doing things .
We only need to look at the Commission &apos;s attempt to salvage the situation with its forthcoming proposal for recasting two directives .
It is the aim of the Commission to establish a system that is balanced , fair , efficient and cost @-@ effective .
Some Member States require proof of merit in order to decide whether or not free legal assistance is granted at the appeal stage .
I therefore trust that , on the basis of what has been said , you will recognise that the Hungarian Presidency is indeed treating this as a priority issue , and we will be counting on your cooperation .
Yet this is something we have to achieve .
There is an urgent need for much stronger consumer protection and for services of general public interest to be shielded from the rules of competition and removed from the control of cartels .
In this , however , I request the Commission &apos;s cooperation .
They are especially important to the whole European economy , not to mention the huge innovation potential they offer .
I am confident that this draft policy document will provide better guidelines for a comprehensive and successful Arctic policy in the EU that will also benefit our northern neighbours .
We , the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , demand that the Arctic should not be allowed to become the next geopolitical hotspot .
In my view , we are in the position to encourage a responsible pre @-@ accession process and a mainly balanced debate in this country about the European Union .
( DE ) Madam President , the plundering of commodities , strategic interests , climate change and , not least , increasing tourism are driving this sensitive ecosystem to the brink of destruction .
A key task is to incorporate a project approach into the new strategy .
I absolutely endorse the view that a special line should be set up in the budget for the Black Sea Synergy .
However , the Black Sea Synergy has produced limited results .
The bloody events of the night of 13 January stunned Europe and the whole world .
Just take the supposed unavailability of resources for renovating Christian churches in Turkey , or the difficulties surrounding the succession of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople .
So we have to be constantly vigilant and be prepared to take firm and immediate action whenever there is unfair competition .
I fully support the key points made by Mrs Gomes in the report , i.e. the need for Libya to introduce a moratorium on the use of the death penalty , to ratify the Geneva Convention on Refugees , to actively fight trafficking of human beings , to guarantee fair agreements for illegal migrants and to adopt modern asylum laws .
These are important in order to promote both inter @-@ religious and inter @-@ cultural dialogue internally and between our societies , which , despite living on different continents , share quite a number of common values and visions .
The artworks in these churches have been burnt , desecrated or plundered ; the cemeteries have been destroyed and Christian bishops are prohibited from holding Mass .
Communications between the EU and Belarus should continue intensively , making use of all the possibilities of diplomacy , and reviewed regularly .
Therefore , I consider it essential to carry out an in @-@ depth analysis on the impact that these measures have had on the economy and finances of the various states and to examine their effectiveness so that the necessary conclusions can be drawn .
That is why I voted in favour of this resolution , which endorses a strategy for the High North .
Emerging economies will increasingly need the resources which are to be found in plentiful supply in the Arctic .
I voted for this report because I consider it to be extremely important for the Black Sea region and the EU .
Corrections to votes and voting intentions : see Minutes
He was also very capable and effective .
( DE ) Mr President , in many ways , Pakistan is a fragile country .
It is not a matter of revenge , but justice must be done .
The matter is now before the Brazilian courts , the Supreme Court has yet to issue its ruling , this issue does not come under ...
The Islamic Republic of Iran is characterised not only by the threat it poses to world peace with a nuclear project capable of evoking the terror of nuclear war , but also by the illegitimacy of its elections ; mass arrests of people requesting free elections ; the killing of objectors ; the rape and physical abuse of those who do not support the regime ; the iniquity of judicial processes , where decisions can be predicted as soon as the accusations have been made ; serious discrimination against women and homosexuals ; and the absence of freedom of expression and of association .
I urge the Commission and the Council to intervene for the immediate release of the lawyer , Nasrin Sotoudeh .
The following amendments have been proposed :
Just as we share a common history , so will we share a common future , as we all know ; and I should like to hope that together we can achieve everything , as I am also certain that we can only achieve everything together .
I welcome the initiative from the President of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek , requesting the European Union for official recognition of the genocide committed by the Nazis and their allies against the Roma population during the Second World War because it marks a step forward in the battle to defend the rights of the most widespread ethnic minority in Europe .
Moving now to innovation , I think there is already broad agreement about what should come out of the European Council .
The competition and innovation programme , the CIP , is struggling for support and the financing for SET , the strategic energy technology programme , is at less than half .
Ensure that we have binding energy efficiency targets that are actually complied with .
Instead of pouring buckets of euros into grand projects , we should focus on identifying and financing smaller , cost @-@ efficient and pragmatic projects that can make a significant difference , such as better interconnections .
( RO ) Mr President , at the European summit on energy taking place on 4 February , the European Union needs to reach agreement at the highest political level on priority measures aimed at establishing the internal energy market and developing the energy infrastructure , as well as on measures for reducing energy consumption , boosting energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy sources .
If there was something with which I did not completely agree , it was the statement on Barack Obama &apos;s State of the Union address .
They treat the will of Parliament with contempt .
In the short term - I think that Baroness Ashton has drawn up a road map - the European Union needs to offer resolute support to these transition processes so as not to frustrate these friendly countries &apos; hopes for freedom .
The radicalisation of Egyptian politics would be a disaster for that country and for neighbouring Israel .
Let us speak together .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Baroness Ashton , I get the impression that you are not yet sufficiently aware of what is going on in the Mediterranean region .
Therefore , the economic situation of Tunisia is an opportunity - aside from the aid that Mrs Ashton has mentioned - for the Central European Bank to take a position so as not to miss an experience that could be vital for the future of the Mediterranean .
It is in our particular interest to have a stable , prosperous and democratic Tunisia with which we can develop beneficial mutual cooperation based on common interests and values .
Change is already happening in these countries .
Ambulances have to be allowed in and out of the square , because we are hearing that they are not being allowed in .
There is hope and there is danger in the ongoing events in Egypt .
The status of Abyei remains uncertain .
The outlook in some quarters is positive , on the other hand , for example in the African Union , which is known to be ready to recognise the independence of the new African state .
There are many Slovak NGOs working in the region , and it is important for them to have the right conditions for their work .
It is our common responsibility to ensure that ESAs get down to business as soon as possible .
There is no guarantee that these authorities will do anything better .
In conclusion , I therefore ask the honourable Members to give their consent to the conclusion of the banana agreement , and also to vote tomorrow for the proposal to repeal the regulation establishing banana duties .
However , when it comes to the European Union , we prefer to turn a blind eye .
I believe that there is a need for us to continuously keep all those concerns and questions you have voiced here in relation to solidarity - concerns which pertain exactly to the poorest countries - on the agenda , and to look for joint solutions , but to give a green light to this banana trade agreement and the law repealing the previous agreement .
I know you share our concerns .
Tuberculosis is a serious economic problem .
We have already alerted you regarding the President of the Chamber of Deputies , who falsified the vote for the all @-@ important pensions law .
Financing instrument for development cooperation - Financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide ( amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 1889 / 2006 ) - A financing instrument for development cooperation ( amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 1905 / 2006 ) - Establishment of a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised countries ( amendment of Regulation ( EC ) No 1934 / 2006 ) ( debate )
Otherwise the Commission is unable to implement the relevant budget .
We must also have subsequent control because billions and billions of euros are being poured into some programmes , which usually end up in the pockets of various dictators , financing their fine lifestyle , while , at the same time , millions and millions of people are living in our own countries , who are also leading very miserable lives .
I would also like to say a word about those who were more critical in their remarks , specifically those who spoke rather sceptically about development cooperation policy , and those who always refer to the taxpayer in order to reject any support for development cooperation policy .
The vote will take place today at 11.30 .
Each of these electronic products contains several materials which we urgently need to recycle and reuse .
Tomorrow it has got to be the rule .
However , it is unfortunate that solar cells are exempt , for if we do not include them it will create an advantage for those solar cells containing cadmium and will distort competition within the industry .
Increasing the rate of separately collected waste is indispensable but it is important that the entire recycling process be monitored through appropriate documentation .
16 . Waste crisis in Campania
This very week I have prepared several questions , to both the Council and the Commission , so that they will investigate whether some companies really make a considered decision about this and whether , therefore , the volume of electronic waste produced at European and at global level could be prevented by combating this type of practice .
There is a wider issue of why we need a European police agency at all .
By supporting this legislative recommendation for second reading , I want to guarantee that the legislative role that the Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Parliament is not devalued through the intransigence of the Council .
These people are promoters of the development of democratic structures , of freedom of the press and speech , and of the fight against corruption and other problems that undermine full respect for human rights , and which are at the root of crises such as those currently occurring in the countries of North Africa .
To be more specific , this subject requires us to reflect on a fundamental question : the direction impressed on the EU &apos;s cooperation policy .
I would like to highlight the allocation of powers to the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union .
On 15 December 2009 , the EU , a group of Latin American countries and the United States reached an agreement on the EU &apos;s tariffs on banana imports , bringing to a close one of the most protracted and bitter disputes in the multilateral trading system &apos;s recent history .
We cannot ignore the possibility , however , that the tariff changes resulting from implementation of the agreement will have a negative impact on the livelihoods of the Union &apos;s own banana producers .
According to the available data , 85 % of electronic waste is currently recycled , although only 33 % of this waste is officially recorded and handled in compliance with the provisions of the EU directive , of course .
As we all know , the efficient and innovative use of energy , materials and resources is a key issue in a globalised economy .
Eight years after the adoption of the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment , the European Parliament is once again giving its opinion on the important issue of recycling high @-@ tech equipment waste .
The present situation in the Middle East has shown how little we know about ordinary Arabs : about what those demonstrating in Tunis and Cairo are thinking , and what they really feel and want .
In that connection , I applaud the courage and determination shown by the Tunisians during the demonstrations , and I join in condemning the repressive measures and the disproportionate force used by the security forces .
in writing . - ( LT ) I agreed with this document , since we must combat tuberculosis , because this disease kills nearly two million people worldwide each year , and almost a third of the world &apos;s population is infected by it .
It is in the interests of preserving our humanity that I am unable to support the approved text of the motion for a resolution .
There will be confusion about who is responsible for what .
There is an urgent need to make an effort to reduce the volume of waste and tip the balance towards the prevention , reduction , re @-@ use and recycling of waste by providing adequate infrastructures .
Time is pressing , we must act fast .
In the second week of March , we are planning to have a comprehensive text , including a recommendation , which will be open to discussion and amendments and which will wind up with a debate in plenary with the participation of the High Representative , who , to our knowledge , is not available this week .
Discussions took place before that ; they took place outside Parliament , too .
We therefore need to have a higher degree of transparency in relation to the process , and I hope that the report can contribute to this .
Furthermore , services of general interest are being destroyed or privatised everywhere .
In my opinion , the directive is appropriate , but in order to achieve its objective , it is important that all Member States follow and comply with all elements of the directive in time and observe the deadlines .
I would like to stress that once again and we have also made that change quite clear .
That is why and how this idea of enhanced cooperation , within the context of the new Treaty of Lisbon , was born .
However , let us stop stalling and let us instead move forward by giving our support to Mr Lehne &apos;s recommendation on this long , long road towards the European patent .
It is therefore impossible to achieve the positive unanimous decision of the Council necessary for further joint progress .
Thus , there was nothing more to be done here , and the Presidency was unable to do anything other than to appeal for closer cooperation , and to this end it has asked , and now I ask personally as well , for your support in the voting .
It is on their behalf that I should like to thank Mr Belet , your rapporteur , for having highlighted important aspects resulting from the need to strengthen health protection measures in the event of the radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and feedingstuffs .
With a view to the future , however , I believe that the acceptable solution would be to place the emphasis on renewable energy sources , and not to increase , by any means , but rather reduce the role of nuclear energy in energy supply to the fullest extent possible .
The Commission &apos;s proposal will include a thorough appraisal of the micro @-@ economic and macro @-@ economic effects of such measures , which will ensure that our proposals are well thought out , in terms of their timescale and impact , and also take into account what is happening in other parts of the world .
In the first part of 2010 , 18 % of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises had bank loans refused .
The European Commission is absolutely committed to trying to convert a policy choice into concrete action , and it is not pure chance that , thanks to the support of Parliament and the Council , we have adopted the text of the Late Payment Directive , which is of fundamental importance for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
We have an enormous opportunity here because we have the technical expertise at our disposal and the potential within the region is huge .
In my opinion , it is therefore necessary , in the interests of reviving and boosting the economic growth of the region , to examine again the planned projects for environmental water infrastructure , which will make it possible not only to reduce the risks and consequences of flooding , but also to improve the navigability of the river , while producing inexpensive , clean electrical power from renewable sources .
First of all , we need to energetically engage in work such as developing ships &apos; hulls in order to lower energy consumption and lessen the negative impact on river beds .
I think that this aspect is less important .
Now , almost a year later , we must move up a gear and do everything we can to ensure that Europe becomes a source of inspiration and a force for proposals .
( SK ) Mr President , in November 2008 , four @-@ year @-@ old Adam Azab , a citizen of the Slovak Republic and the European Union , was forcibly separated from his mother in Egypt .
That concludes the item .
We are taking an important step forward today .
No , it is not , particularly as it is diverting attention from the real crisis - not that we are releasing carbon dioxide from fossil fuels , but that we are beginning to run low on the oil which powers our civilisation .
However , I would stress that we are not doing manufacturers any favours by defending the status quo and that , as far as the public authorities are concerned , by failing to encourage innovation , they are not fulfilling their role .
Member of the Commission . - Mr President , first , a brief remark to Mr Pargneaux who asked what the plan was for the next few years .
Let me convey my heartfelt thanks to you for making this happen .
( DE ) Madam President , improving the rights of passengers on regular bus and coach services is a desirable goal .
I am pleased that common sense has prevailed in this case , and that urban and suburban transport will be protected from excessive regulation .
in writing . - I support this compromise on the rights of bus passengers , guaranteeing a right to transport , a right to accessible travel information , the obligation for bus operators to organise mandatory disability awareness training for drivers , a right to compensation for damaged wheelchairs , a complaint @-@ handling mechanism for all passengers , with independent national bodies to enforce the regulation and issue penalties .
Years ago , when the European Parliament had little more power than a militant NGO , its only tools were the rhetoric of naming and shaming .
Issuing a visa ban for the officials responsible for Magnitsky and other cases is one concrete measure to show that the EU is serious about the improvement of the rule of law and transparency in Russia .
Thank you for the suggestion , Mr Bradbourn .
Where is the protection for the rights of citizens of Europe if - as Mrs Meissner has already stressed - entire States such as Cyprus , Luxembourg and Malta are excluded from this protection ?
In the 2020 strategy , we have put much emphasis particularly on renewable energies , and that is only right .
( IT ) Madam President , I mostly support the amendments proposed through this text , which in any case essentially does nothing more than codify previous legislation regarding the maximum permitted levels of radioactive contamination of foodstuffs and animal feedingstuffs .
Since this is , above all , an economic and commercial agreement , the amended text supports the economic and social transition process in the Republic of South Africa , promoting regional cooperation and providing fresh impetus to the country &apos;s economic integration into the global economy .
I think that the agreement on aviation relations between the European Union and Brazil provides a sound legal basis and marks an important first step in strengthening EU @-@ Brazil aviation relations .
Supplementary regulations are needed in this respect to protect the financial interests of the EU and to give auditing powers to the Court of Auditors .
In view of the new rules of the Treaty of Lisbon , which allow Parliament to be associated with the conclusion of international agreements in a much closer way , as well as the fact that Liechtenstein has concluded the agreement in question , which has been in force since 1 July 2005 , I support Parliament &apos;s decision to give its consent to the conclusion of this protocol .
A country with a rapidly developing tourism sector , this number can only rise .
However , four EU countries - Estonia , Latvia , Malta and Cyprus - have not signed agreements of this type .
Although I regret that this is not in the final text , I congratulate Mrs Gebhardt , who has managed to mention these issues in her report on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection , which focused mainly on mutual evaluation and the points of single contact .
The Services Directive adopted in 2006 aimed to harmonise certain aspects of the single market related to the provision of services .
Allowing service providers to operate outside their own country is integral to the EU &apos;s single market and reducing the bureaucracy at national level can allow the directive to make a contribution to EU economic growth and its jobs objectives .
Moreover , passengers will also be entitled to compensation if their luggage is lost or damaged .
The force majeure clause ( adverse weather conditions or natural disasters ) can be invoked all too easily by coach companies to avoid paying compensation to passengers in the event of a delay or cancellation .
Specific measures are thus going to be introduced to enhance the legal certainty , rights and information of bus and coach passengers .
That is why it seems appropriate to me that the compromise will be adopted only following the revision of the regulation by January 2013 and only following the feasibility study and reassessment of the objectives .
I believe that the report is necessary in view of European Union objectives relating to global warming and emission reduction .
Therefore , I am against the Lehne report .
The Czech Republic wishes to participate in this enhanced cooperation and also wishes to take part in further negotiations over concrete proposals for a regulation on the unitary patent and its language regime .
This is why enhanced cooperation is fully justified on this subject , which is fundamental for the future of the EU .
I support Mr Belet &apos;s report , because we must guarantee protection for farmers from damages caused by external third parties .
Here , we are talking about a fundamental value of the European Union , and I want to be very precise on this point .
I would like to make a third and final comment .
That is why we are now looking to find a solution for competitiveness and for convergence - and I stress convergence - in the Union .
Secondly , would this mean substantial reductions in the brutal levels of interest charged ?
Mr President , the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights makes it clear that Belgium and Greece have contravened Articles 3 and 13 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
As one of my fellow Members has mentioned , we must ask ourselves whether we want to build walls around Europe or whether we want to maintain and develop the right to asylum , something which I , as a Liberal , strongly support .
We are also working with EASO , the new asylum support office in Valletta .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we need to provide an immediate political response to these emergencies .
I ask myself , Commissioner , how on earth Europe has kept quiet about this democratic awakening , while only the United States has offered strong guidance in this respect .
We must act quickly to ensure that we do not miss this historic moment and that it is not only the pictures of refugees which remain in our memories . We must remember what these countries have really achieved .
rapporteur . - ( NL ) Madam President , allow me to start this debate by thanking my colleagues for their extremely pleasant and fruitful cooperation .
It is obvious that , if this will be the case , we will be able to continue this debate more fruitfully .
However , Mrs Oomen @-@ Ruijten &apos;s report contains , in the view of the French Socialists , an indication which poses us a problem , and with which we will not be able to agree .
Individual countries should be responsible for their own policies and reforms .
We should also recognise that ongoing reforms carry new risks as they make future pensions far more dependent on long @-@ term developments in the labour market and financial markets .
This is why , by adopting Act no 263 / 2010 , Romania has introduced a series of major reforms which will ensure the sustainability of the public pension system in the medium and long term .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we can all imagine the nightmare .
I suppose that is up to each individual Member State .
Therefore , we have to be pragmatic .
Commission intervention in these cases is exceptional and limited to concrete situations foreseen in the legislation .
For our part , the Commission has commissioned an independent five @-@ pillar audit of the Global Fund , as required under European Union financial regulations for all organisations benefiting from EU financial support .
We have already introduced a test for SMEs which is designed to take into greater account the procedure used in assessing the impact of the various policies and obligations that constrain SMEs .
This would be a very good example to the Member States , both to people working in the public and in the private sectors .
I hope that his assurance does not involve any conditions or loopholes .
We must point out that the impasse will only be resolved by a responsible stand on the part of the political leaders , with a readiness for political dialogue and not , as we have heard , with a &apos; winner takes all &apos; attitude and similar practices and conduct .
The 2009 elections were the best that have so far taken place in Albania and they were based on election legislation which , amazingly , was adopted following a consensus between the socialists and democrats . Reaching a consensus is something entirely new in Albania .
But there was another question : whether we are considering sanctions .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Mr President , thank you , Commissioner , for your very careful statement .
I do not know how that can be , as all the Bulgarian Members seem to be here .
( BG ) Mr President , after everything I have heard so far , all I can say is that we have , unfortunately , yet again been witness to a pitiful performance put on by the Bulgarian opposition to bring a domestic political debate to the European Parliament .
The same goes for nuclear energy .
We have a series of documents which holds a set of assumptions , all of them rarely discussed .
I would say it is still access to energy that we should be looking at , because access to energy also means sustainable and efficient energy .
Yesterday , we discussed Albania .
We should support this for political reasons .
We must appreciate that the Croatian head of state has made several gestures toward the historic reconciliation of Serbia , Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina and Croatia .
This process requires profound reforms which are often highly unpopular with the public .
The Annual Growth Survey provides the basis for discussion at the Spring European Council in March and for the economic policy guidance to be addressed to the Member States .
What do you have to say about the measures on pay and public expenditure ?
We have increasing numbers of poor workers .
( FI ) Madam President , our fellow Member on the right insisted that policy only interferes with the economy and that people in this House only do things that interfere with policy .
This is the reason for the indignation among millions of workers , unemployed , women and young people who continue to fight against such policies throughout Europe .
The governments have been alerted and a complex set of policies , from education to employment services and other types of measures , is required .
Industrial growth and job creation across the EU will ensure that the European Union is globally competitive .
( IT ) Mr President , the Commission proposal on preventing the entry of falsified medicines into the supply chain highlights a concern that is becoming a priority for all Europeans : the quality and safety of the medicines we use every day .
I believe that access to funding for business development , particularly in the field of innovation , is especially important .
We are in fact facing serious demographic challenges .
Over the past year , Croatia has shown the will to continue with the necessary reforms , particularly with the adoption of substantial amendments and supplements to the constitution , but also with the harmonisation of legislation with the Community acquis , and I would like the Hungarian Presidency now to complete the accession talks with Croatia .
In such cases patients are mainly reliant on themselves , and their medical knowledge does not necessarily enable them to identify a fake product .
I am therefore pleased that this text has been approved by Parliament , since we MEPs have fought to improve the European Commission &apos;s initial proposal in which the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industries took precedence over the health and safety of the European people .
However , I have voted against the report because the proposed measures , particularly the import controls , do not , in my opinion , go far enough .
in writing . - ( LT ) I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution .
Instead of placing banks under an obligation to support the real economy by providing appropriate credit , Parliament is calling for it to be easier for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises to get contributions from investment funds and private equity firms on the capital markets .
The importance of social security and pension funds is therefore undoubtedly increasing , particularly given the current economic crisis .
The report clearly promotes the harmonised , anti @-@ social policies of the European Union and the reduction of social rights to the lowest common liberal denominator .
We voted to remove from paragraph 8 the inclusion of private debt in the sustainability assessment of public finances , as we feel that current market conditions would not be supported by this kind of assessment .
In the report , the European Parliament confirmed that in matters concerning pensions systems , the Member State is responsible for the organisation of its national pension system .
In some European countries , such as Lithuania , the government maintains that the crisis is over and that the economy is gradually beginning to recover .
Croatia is in a privileged location : it is a transport corridor of great importance for the import and export markets of the East and Far East .
I welcome the Croatian Government &apos;s efforts to combat various forms of corruption and the reforms of the public administration , and the judiciary being implemented .
Rising food prices ( debate )
I am delighted that when agriculture suddenly becomes food , we debate this very important issue in the middle of the day when people can hear .
Madam President , the main reasons for food inflation have been rising global commodity prices , soaring energy prices and volatility within the marketplace , and there is no doubt that the consumer is suffering .
We have to look at the agricultural and trade policies that are destroying small and medium @-@ sized agriculture , that promote models of intensive production for export and that , in this way , threaten food security and sovereignty ; as is the case with the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) .
Commissioner , the idea of proposing further set @-@ aside areas within the framework of the common agricultural policy by means of screening is the wrong approach .
This is already taking place through a number of international organisations and programmes such as FAO and the World Food Programme , as well as through more general forums such as the G20 .
Poverty is an issue within European borders , too .
However , the EU &apos;s appeal remains intact .
Do you think it is better , together with the dictator , to now force the refugees to return ?
It is about time that Europe said that we refuse to be used as a vehicle for such people to park their funds any more .
In my opinion , we now have sufficient experience of revolutions against dictatorial regimes to be concerned that we would be interfering in the internal affairs of other countries through our advice .
Moreover , any restrictions on broadcasters would need to respect the principle of proportionality .
I would be interested to know to which countries you are referring and what you personally intend to do about it .
What does Commissioner Neelie Kroes think about this ?
However , replacing one kind of propaganda with another kind of propaganda does not make it right .
I have to apologise that you did not receive the text , but I myself did not receive it or , at least , I had only the text that we were negotiating and I could not distribute that to you .
That is why I took the initiative of bringing together in Davos the trade ministers of the world &apos;s seven most important trading countries to discuss , in concrete terms , how we can now proceed and enter the end @-@ game , following the impetus given by the G20 in Seoul .
That is what we as the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe have concentrated on .
All this , Mr Sturdy , Commissioner , has nothing whatsoever to do with neo @-@ protectionism .
( DE ) Since I submitted the question , a group of Serbian citizens of Albanian nationality have been given the maximum sentences in a show trial by a special court where they stood accused of crimes in Kosovo .
Mrs Ticau and Mr Rubiks both asked their questions about the Danube strategy .
3 . Uganda : murder of David Kato (
The efficiency of the utilisation of structural funds and European Investment Bank funds must be improved , and so must the coordination of EU funds , national funds and other forms of support that can act as a leverage to stimulate investment in energy efficiency .
I am sorry , but we are living in a global economy .
First of all , does this House know of any crisis that has been resolved through the existence of a new tax ?
The current volume of financial transactions is excessive compared to the needs of the real economy .
In Poland , we did not supplement the financial system .
This should involve , first of all , better and more comprehensive regulations , which are accepted globally , and which would exclude speculation and gambling from the financial sector , without unnecessary damage to savers or clients .
Furthermore , Member States may not allow a third @-@ country vessel to use their ports if the vessel is not flying the flag of a GFCM contracting party , if it has been engaged in illegal , unregulated and unreported ( IUU ) fishing , or if it does not have a valid authorisation to engage in fishing ( Article 23 ) .
The hallmarks of the package are two things : clarity and simplification , so that everybody understands exactly what is involved .
We need to be able to quantify these fishing activities and ensure they are controlled , in order to contribute to the development of local fisheries and to make European vessel owners &apos; work easier .
We have to respect this agreement .
The Italian majority , in fact , called on the Constitutional Court to decide which court should try Mr Berlusconi .
This will involve stepping up the battle against public debt , stabilising our currency and aligning our economic , social and taxation systems more closely .
The Commission is determined to make sure that both consumers and businesses benefit from the EU internal market in safe goods .
All that was missing for me in the report was a proposal on how to introduce personal responsibility into the healthcare system .
In other words , health inequalities are not just related to access to healthcare , but also to factors as different as living conditions , housing , education , profession , income and lifestyle .
You also highlight gender inequality as an important element contributing to social health inequalities .
Concerning the second matter , the Commission considers tax evasion and harmful tax competition as major obstacles to domestic resource mobilisation .
Thanks to its unique and diverse know @-@ how , the EU agri @-@ food sector has a strong card to play on the global marketplace .
This policy demonstrated that production could be adapted to policies .
Opening of the sitting
However , looking at the technological points that the rapporteur makes , it is not just in the longer term that we should be looking for savings , but also in the short term , when we should be able to come up with cost @-@ cutting measures .
This is a waste of money : we should be making savings and introduce a better , credible system of security .
Well then , unfortunately , we will have to raise the spectre of quotas and binding targets .
It pays special attention to women and young people .
All that is happening with draconian maternity leave , let me tell you , Madam , is that fewer and fewer young women in my country are getting jobs because you would have to be stark staring mad to employ a young woman if you have a small business .
Is it your wish that we should have these commitments by next year , or that women should have been appointed by next year ?
( PL ) Madam President , the reports on inequalities affecting women and men in the European Union contain many suggestions for what should be done and what steps should be taken to reduce these inequalities .
Quotas are indeed something that women need if they are to get anywhere .
We have to tackle and we have to prevent and reduce poverty and we need concrete measures .
Nevertheless , inequalities still prevail and there are many battles yet to be fought , not least of which is a persistent wage gap and the place of women on the boards of large companies .
We expect that in the Council , too , we will declare that we intend to emphasise the role of Roma women in holding their families together , which would be a good basis to build upon when seeking answers to the issues of the Roma population .
Finally , on International Women &apos;s Day , I must pay tribute to motherhood .
I believe that new technologies can help combat counterfeiting , especially in the textile sector .
We have to understand the consequences of printing money too cheaply and of holding interest rates down so that people make investments based on bad decisions , and of not recognising that money itself has a value .
On top of that , we use something called sanitary and phytosanitary standards .
Premiums will rise and fewer people will take up insurance .
This is why the motion for revising this directive is more than timely .
I would point , in particular , to amendments to safety rules for products aimed at the most vulnerable consumers within the single market , namely children , the elderly and people with disabilities .
The case of H1N1 influenza highlighted flawed risk management at a global level , mainly due to the inadequate correlation between the levels of alert and the actual dangers , the consequences of which entailed a large wastage of funds .
There is also need for better cooperation , to request a review of prevention plans and the roles of key actors , and also to enable Member States to make group purchases on a voluntary basis .
This simplification is required in order to avoid the drawing @-@ up of annual regulations to update legislation , as has occurred in the past .
I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM Agreement Area .
According to this approach , individual interest does not set any limitation on the collective interest , let alone the general interest .
Although the text has no direct legislative effect , it does mark a decisive political step forward : from now on , the European right within the European Parliament will be unable to prevent the introduction of such a tax .
This report reveals tendencies in this direction , which is why I have voted against it .
For these reasons , I voted in favour of the document during the plenary session .
A special focus is also needed on health prevention and information , in coordination with organisations from civil society .
in writing . - I voted for this report and welcome its focus on inequality in health among lower socio @-@ economic groups .
The report will also allow for the creation of a transparent , cooperative and fair international tax environment .
Cooperation must be based on mutual assistance , without creating additional obstacles or burdens for either party .
The report on relations between EU agriculture and international trade shows us the disastrous loss of power that European agriculture has suffered , and attempts to alert the European institutions , which are responsible for this failure .
in writing . - I voted against this report which sends out a highly protectionist message as regards Parliament &apos;s attitude to trade .
We have voted in favour .
Recent climate change has brought this subject onto the agenda and I consider it an important element of the CAP reform that is expected soon .
In order to combat this phenomenon , we are proposing that the common agricultural policy reform should include the introduction of new provisions to assist farmers in improving crop rotation systems , investment in research on protein crop seeds , and improved training of farmers in crop rotation and mixed farming .
Such a policy would be good for farmers &apos; incomes and make a substantial contribution to combating climate change , to the preservation of biodiversity , and to soil fertility .
Although the principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights , we cannot help but notice that this remains an unrealised objective .
All forms of physical , sexual or psychological violence , however serious , must be combated and condemned .
In the European Parliament , only 35 % of MEPs are women , just 15 % of MPs in national parliaments are women , and only 3 % of boards of directors in the main European companies are chaired by women .
In 2008 , the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union , aware of the need to raise awareness amongst the public and the Member States of the problem of combating poverty , adopted a decision considering 2010 the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion .
I would like to highlight the priceless contribution of women to the healthy development of the family and the raising of children , which must not be unfavourably influenced by discrimination against women , because such undesirable phenomena also have a heavy impact on society itself .
Analyses show that we are not just talking about the need for equal treatment for men and women , but that these policies would have a major impact on economies , with a 30 % rise in GDP .
However , that will probably not always be the case .
We need genuine , understandable decision @-@ making processes in Brussels , so that citizens from Greece to Denmark , in Germany and in Spain , trust in us .
How are we going to link the competitiveness pact with the EU 2020 strategy ?
Madam President , my country , Ireland , is a small open economy with a heavy concentration on foreign direct investment .
Despite the negotiations , which are at an advanced stage and are also becoming increasingly complex , the Hungarian Presidency is committed to making progress with regard to all chapters where progress is possible .
Fourthly , women &apos;s rights .
Ladies and gentlemen , when are we going to stop this sham ?
Madam President , I greatly regret that the Turkish accession process is stalled .
No , not yet .
The author , Orhan Pamuk , escaped prosecution for a heretical view of Turkish history only because of his international fame .
The treaty of 1924 clearly declares that citizens professing the Islamic faith are Turks , while citizens professing another faith are regarded as Greek Catholics .
The credibility of our enlargement policy is based on the enlargement countries respecting the conditionality towards the European Union and the European Union respecting its commitment towards the enlargement countries .
Finally , I am glad to see that Montenegro is continuously proceeding further in the integration process .
A significant proportion of European Roma face such substandard conditions - almost totally disconnected from the economy resulting in their exclusion from basic human rights - that fostering social inclusion cannot be viewed within the framework of general policy ratification but must be handled as bridging one of the most enormous gaps in the fulfilment of constitutional and human rights in Europe .
Europe can assist in this by setting goals based on real data , providing the necessary tools , calling the Member States to account for the accomplishment of the goals set , and monitoring the changes in the situation of the Roma .
It is not the syrup of do @-@ goodism but serious , surgical measures that will enable us to lance the boil of rackets , child exploitation and organ trafficking .
This means that all children should be given the chance of physical and mental development , which involves daily warm meals just as much as the right to education .
This process for us Roma , and I believe for the whole European Union , is about much more than mutual trust .
The background to the situation is as follows . As a result of a decision by the European Council in 2007 and subsequent resolutions by the European Parliament and the Energy Council - in other words , after wide @-@ ranging consultation with Parliament and the Member States - the Commission submitted its proposal for an ecodesign regulation in 2009 .
Has the Commission approved the exemption from VAT of the sale of agricultural products to intermediaries ?
I am really sorry and , as I said , I am angry but this is the situation we have been put in .
Commissioner , thank you for that small insight into women in business .
I would like to focus on a very topical problem faced by Greek industry this week .
We have a strong foundation : young Europeans have never been so well prepared , and yet we lack engineers , we lack young entrepreneurs , and we lack innovative policies for managing human resources .
Then I am also thinking of the automotive industry &apos;s supply chain , which is essential for Europe .
I therefore very much welcome both the attitude of Commissioner Tajani and the report of our colleague , Mr Bernd Lange , on this subject .
The vote will take place at 11 : 30 on Wednesday , 9 March 2011 .
However , this is not just about rare earth elements ( REEs ) , but also about magnesite , for example , which is the most important raw material for fireproof products and which is essential for the production of steel , glass , cement and other materials .
Our watchwords must be effective recycling of materials already used and the promotion of research and development programmes into alternative products .
Furthermore , while global demand for rare earth elements is still growing , China has announced drastic cuts to its exports , as vividly described by a group of Japanese experts during a very interesting presentation they made when visiting the European Parliament in February 2011 .
It is therefore clear from what has been said that these new non @-@ traditional gas sources are also becoming an interesting alternative for the exploitation of new horizontal extraction technologies .
We look to ourselves , and if we have alternatives - which we have here through shale gas - we must exploit those to the full .
We also want to see , through the paper , support with the training and exchange of students .
That must be the goal of all the efforts that we undertake over the forthcoming days , weeks and months , including here in the European Parliament .
The resolution does not say so , but the weapons with which the Libyan people are being repressed are largely European weapons and bombs .
( FR ) Mr President , Baroness Ashton , this time , Europe must be present at the meeting .
We also need a European immigration and asylum policy , a deterrent policy including the closure of airspace , and full support for the opponents of Mr Gaddafi &apos;s regime .
( DE ) Mr President , I would just like to deal briefly once again with the issue of the Southern Neighbourhood Policy
My personal opinions do not count in this .
Here , too , we need to have the ability to present ourselves more strongly as unified .
It is important that the Commission is to be on the board of mechanism and , above all , that the rules for the operation of the mechanism , including the terms of the strict conditionality , are prescribed by a regulation proposed by the Commission and codecided by Parliament and the Council .
I urge the Heads of State to reflect very deeply on the consequences for Europe if they reject the broad consensus of this directly elected Parliament .
Secondly , the permanent stability mechanism can only be created with security and legal certainty if it is included in the Treaties in a clear way .
I have to inform you that the Commission is closely associated with the preparatory work and that we consider it essential that we are also involved in setting up and operating this mechanism .
( Objections )
We must accept responsibility on our borders .
Voting time now continues .
They deserve better than this .
It is not enough to have a good report : we also need action .
in writing . - According to European law , 12 plenary sessions must take place every year at the Strasbourg seat of the European Parliament .
It is worth highlighting the fact that certain investments , particularly in technology , could result in future savings in the long term , and therefore , these should not be prevented .
I therefore voted against this report .
Over the years , there has been an improvement in cooperation between Member States on issues of safety , security and maritime surveillance .
These commitments and efforts by Turkey should be viewed as an opportunity for Turkey itself to modernise , given the support from Turkish citizens and civil society for Turkey &apos;s further democratisation and their commitment to an open and pluralistic society .
We must face up to the truth and admit that Europe cannot currently compete in terms of economic development with such countries as China , India and Brazil .
First of all , the ongoing issue with Cyprus needs to be concluded between the Greek @-@ Cypriot and Turkish @-@ Cypriot communities , during which the withdrawal of Turkish troops will also be negotiated .
The decision to grant candidate status to Montenegro was primarily political .
Moreover , efforts should be made to increase political and civic participation by the Roma , starting with the youngest .
Furthermore , we must monitor the use of EU funds to ensure that the money actually reaches the intended recipients .
I am pleased that this text denounces racial hate speech , ethnic profiling , unlawful fingerprinting and unlawful eviction and expulsion .
The global economic crisis has affected European industry and therefore , to be able to overcome the effect of the crisis and face those challenges , the EU needs an industrial policy approach that combines competitiveness , sustainability and decent work that can , at the same time , stimulate the economy , boost employment , reduce environmental degradation and improve quality of life .
Rather , it has been promoting the dismantling of important productive centres , deindustrialisation , the elimination of jobs , and growing dependence in innumerable countries and regions .
The recent economic and financial crisis has highlighted the importance of industry to the EU economy , which means that it is important to recognise the need for an integrated approach to industrial policy , combining competitiveness , innovation and sustainability , whilst , at the same time , showing itself capable of stimulating growth , creating jobs and ensuring environmental preservation .
On the contrary , in that respect , Iran must be called to account for its own behaviour .
Parliament has , with this report , made it unmistakeably clear that democratic change cannot be brought about by external military means .
It is said that hanging using these European cranes is particularly cruel and the agony lasts for a long period .
I have especially in mind blacklisting top Iranian officials ( Ms Schaake mentioned eighty names ) , supporting the start of Farsi @-@ language Euronews broadcasts and insisting that parliamentary relations - if any - should be conducted under strict conditionality .
The debate is closed .
This being so , I welcome the 16th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council and I trust that , with current developments and with the lessons we have learned from experience , it will adopt fundamental resolutions .
At the same time , however , all the international players need to work to eliminate the practice of double standards when it comes to citing human rights .
That is partly a resources question but , of course , I will keep honourable Members informed about that .
Do we have the right to provide economic and trade incentives when so many human rights and so many aspects of international law are constantly being violated ?
Democratisation must succeed here too .
Any further delay in resolving the conflict risks compromising Israeli and Palestinian hopes of reaching a fair solution and compromises the future of such a fragile area of the Mediterranean and the Middle East .
You know that Mr Erkat , who was the chief negotiator , is moving to a new position as a senior advisor for President Abbas on the grounds that it was from his office and he must take responsibility for it .
Permission was given for it to go through on that basis .
Citizens see what is happening .
What is already happening in this field in certain countries , such as Portugal , Greece or Ireland , and which is of the utmost seriousness , are salary cuts and pension freezes , even on the lowest pensions and those below the poverty line .
I sincerely hope ...
To conclude , Mr President , once again I urge the Commission to take the broad consensus that this report attracted , when it was voted upon and discussed , as a clear sign that these recommendations , the recommendations contained in this report , are to be put into practice .
The report makes particular mention of the fact that agricultural production is vulnerable to climate phenomena such as drought , frost , hail , forest fires , floods , landslides and others .
I believe that these are the key points which need to be resolved so that we can ensure that we are prepared to manage such a situation successfully in the future .
In this regard , we must also send a very clear outward signal that a reduction in the number of airspace blocks is absolutely necessary .
We therefore have to get European airports to work properly too .
What does the Commission intend to do in this regard ?
To begin with , I am going to read you two written declarations .
( Loud applause )
The perpetrators , who belong mainly to state institutions , are acting with impunity .
The Communists have been , and are now , in the front line of this fight .
It is our duty to support this alternative and to protect the Libyan people against the forces of the regime .
It remains to be seen whether the Heads of State or Government will comply with this call .
It is time that Iran fulfilled its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , which it ratified of its own free will .
Our resolution is particularly significant because we have today remembered the suppression of peaceful protests against the violent occupation of Tibet 52 years ago .
That is not only in the interests of the West .
However , in the climate prevailing after the Taseer murder , the amendments were withdrawn from parliament .
I would like to ask the Commission to report on further measures that can be taken against Lukashenko &apos;s regime .
Mr President , today &apos;s debate on the rights of ethnic minorities in China comes a day after the Dalai Lama officially announced that he is resigning from his political role in Tibet .
The policy being pursued of so @-@ called urban reconstruction is resulting in the gradual disappearance of this group &apos;s identity , which developed its culture around the fortress situated on the Silk Road .
It is the opinion of the entire European Parliament .
( For results and other details of the vote : see Minutes )
I voted in favour of a stability mechanism ( ESM ) for the Member States of the euro area in order to help those of our neighbours that are in difficulty .
The collection of money at European level allows Member States to cut spending to avoid overlap and to achieve a better return on their investment .
On 28 February 2011 , in record time , the Council adopted decisions concerning restrictive measures against the regime .
On the financial stabilisation front , Member States have eventually acknowledged the degree of interdependence of their economies .
However , I have my doubts and I fear that we will continue to experience what has been going on for the past year . I am sorry , but I have to say that the leadership of the European Union is blundering its way along .
What should be emphasised more clearly in the overall package of measures is the additional need for investment in crisis @-@ hit countries in particular , and this must go beyond small extensions of credit and slight reductions in interest rates .
That is the only adjustment we need to make to the Stability and Growth Pact .
The mechanism should be brought as close as possible to EU institutions , so that they might monitor how it is used .
The whole euro area and the European Union may suffer a crisis if decisions are delayed .
Mr President , so the European Council will adopt the decision to amend the Treaty with regard to the European Stability Mechanism , but will allegedly help countries stay inside the eurozone .
It is not an exclusive club .
I also pay tribute to the courage and fortitude of those who are now struggling to tackle the consequences of the terrible earthquake and tsunami , as well as those endeavouring to deal with the consequences of the nuclear incident .
It is , first and foremost , a tragedy for all those people who have been affected .
While Japan will undoubtedly learn swiftly from these events , Europe too must take these lessons on board and our reaction might be broken up into two areas .
We should also support new technologies .
We must also be aware that , after a terrible tragedy of this nature , people will become more afraid , and this is precisely why we must make sure that objective and genuine information is given and safety measures are tightened .
Thank you very much , Mr President .
Work has already started , although the international environmental impact assessments of both plants are far from complete .
The programming cycle for the operation of the General Programme on Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows sets tight deadlines , and effective planning can be provided through implementing acts .
I was also pleased to hear you saying that this process would not be paralysed because of legal issues .
I would like to state that this is a very important question .
I know that you are working on that aim .
Thank you for your cooperation .
It means that the consumer &apos;s cooling off period will be extended to 14 days throughout the Union .
I think that it is right , as Viviane Reding says , that the co @-@ legislators now have to move forward and make some decisions .
( ES ) Mr President , achieving a Consumer Rights Direcive , so establishing a horizontal instrument that will simplify , summarise and complement the four already @-@ existing directives , is positive .
A compromise is always an opportunity to achieve a balance between different interests .
I welcome the efforts that have been undertaken with the aim of EU @-@ wide harmonisation of distance selling regulations , which are aimed at protecting consumers and making it easier for traders to operate .
The environmental impact of tar sands is clear .
Finally , I would like to emphasise once again that Parliament has made a concession on the transitional regulation .
This is all about a general improvement of the preference system as a whole .
One right which EU consumers are entitled to is that of food security and safety .
All of this has been done using a mix of public statements , which you have seen , and direct contacts with the authorities concerned .
The agreement removes all restrictions on routes , prices or the number of weekly flights between Canada and the European Union .
In that respect we have long since passed the first stage of 25 % and already reached the second stage of 49 % ownership of each other &apos;s air services market .
Even in this strategic sector , the aim is to cripple state intervention and regulation , opening the doors to the monopolistic concentration that always results from free competition , which is considered sacrosanct .
With that in mind , I would point out two differences between national budgeting and Europe &apos;s budget .
The first is that the report on the 2012 budget is based on the assumption of enhanced economic governance involving the EU , the European Semester mechanism and the Europe 2020 objectives to boost growth and employment .
( FR ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank our rapporteur , Mrs Balzani , for the consistency of her draft resolution on the general guidelines for the 2012 budget .
Secondly , my reaction to Mr Elles - but not only to him : the same remark about negative priorities was also made by Mr Geier and Ms Hohlmeier .
( FR ) Mr President , unless I have misunderstood , I believe that you should have put the original text of Article 12 ( 2 ) ( e ) to the vote , but we have not voted on this item .
There is certainly a recurring problem here , though , and that is the lack of a firm legal status for immigrants and , as a result , the possibility of discrimination against them .
I call on the Council urgently to table proposals in this regard .
Given the fact that the economy of Moldova is being heavily hit by the negative effects of the global financial and economic crisis , and that its wine sector employs about 300 000 workers , this report , which I voted for , proposes the increase of the current tariff quota for wine in order to support Moldova &apos;s efforts and to provide an attractive and viable market for its wine exports , which , moreover , do not compete with Portuguese products .
Furthermore , the GSP was intended to ensure that the products supported originated in developing countries .
The promises of benefits for workers and passengers that always accompany these liberalisation processes are as old and trite as they are false , as demonstrated by the reality in cases where liberalisation has gone ahead , whether in this sector or in other sectors .
I am in favour of adopting the motion for a resolution on the above matter .
, in writing - ( CS ) In my opinion , the aviation agreement with Canada is a fundamental commercial instrument which will deliver benefits to both sides , but in view of the discrimination against Czech citizens and the position of MPs from the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic , I am abstaining from the vote .
There are also further issues , such as competition , where compliance with EU law should be ensured through amending or complementing existing provisions in bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries .
The Persian Gulf countries are extremely important players in the peace process .
The ECB is and remains a bulwark in defence of the monetary union and the euro .
The priority objectives set in the Europe 2020 Strategy ( promoting employment , improving public spending on innovation , research and development , meeting our climate change and energy objectives , improving education levels and promoting social inclusion ) should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger , through smart , sustainable and inclusive growth .
It is essential to guarantee a certain level of coherence between the attainment of the results in question and the resources assigned to them at EU and national level , thereby improving synergies between European and domestic public investments .
In actual fact , issuing a single document will also make it easier to check on people admitted to a Member State and authorised to work there .
It has been some 20 years since the European Union established the internal market envisaged by the founding fathers .
in writing . - I voted against as I feel that it opens the door to unfair competition to EU workers and low @-@ cost migrant workers coming to the EU .
The proposal would have led to a reduction in consumer rights in various European countries and there was no evidence it would have benefitted the market .
It is true enough that the adoption of the Schwab report does not fully satisfy either consumer groups opposed to the principle of full harmonisation or the representatives of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and chambers of commerce who wanted the legislation to be restricted to boosting e @-@ commerce .
The Internet is recognised as being one of the most important public spaces in the 21st century .
Japan is overwhelmed today .
in writing . - ( LT ) We have watched Japan suffer a series of horrific disasters , the likes of which no other country has ever experienced together .
( Applause )
Wednesday
As we know , those asylum numbers have been plummeting for many years .
Asylum seekers must not become victims of our systems .
In this way , participation in international exhibitions and fairs will become easier .
Our problem concerns the fact that not all of the EU &apos;s Member States apply the same criteria with regard to the export of dual @-@ use items .
I worked on the file as a shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group and , as I said earlier , we are going to vote in favour of it .
If a hotel has two , three or four stars , this must be very clearly formulated .
As long as women are affected by gender @-@ based violence - just because we are women - we will not be able to call our society an equal society .
This gender @-@ specific violence , which also has a strong negative impact on children , and tends to worsen during periods of economic and social crisis , can no longer be accepted .
( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , violence against women is a serious violation of human rights , as we have all already asserted .
The strategy should also consider a free legal service and social assistance for victims of violence .
I also welcome the report because of the need to send a clear and strong message to society that violence will not be tolerated .
The aim is to define the objectives of the approach more clearly and in more strategic terms .
However , there is growing concern about what is happening to minors - unaccompanied or separated at arrival .
The failure to recognise this means that tensions will simply increase and will plunge a number of those countries a little further into poverty .
These immigrants had been transferred there because Lampedusa is overfull .
I went to Lampedusa on Monday and saw 4 000 - 5 000 people on the ground , huddling together to sleep under the sun and the rain , doing their business where they ate and not being able to change the wet clothes - which some have said were designer labels , but are , in fact , fake designer labels - they had on during the crossing , in lamentable conditions .
( IT ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for your words .
It is very difficult for me to explain to these Somalis that you cannot come to Europe because we have not agreed on delegated or implemented acts .
The motion for a resolution highlights a very significant and important matter .
( EL ) Madam President , the conclusions of the last summit provided anything but reassurance .
Greater account must be taken of the wide range of vocational skills , interests and achievements of women .
Shutting down nuclear power plant units early and decommissioning them is a major financial and economic burden .
The right of states and of the EU to take the measures necessary to achieve legitimate public policy objectives is a standing rule of the common commercial policy .
Gaddafi must go .
My group strongly supports it , but demands - and I shall continue to demand - that it is implemented in the context of the Community method , under the auspices of the Commission , Mr President .
The only way to find the money is to create a real European bond market , and we know it .
But he has got oil and he has got money so you all turned a blind eye , didn &apos;t you ?
The opportunity is being seized on by many to launch plans for permanent economic governance , with intervention and control as its guiding principles .
What is striking is that it seems to me that in some situations the team representing ideals refuses to play the game .
Schools are being closed , teachers are losing their jobs , researchers are finding themselves out on the street and public investments are being cut or left to stagnate .
The problem is not simply one of assessing the actual economic and technical contents of the European Council .
During the financial crisis I often heard both the Commission President and the President of the European Council talk in praising terms of automatic stabilisers .
I was interested in the comments made by Catherine Day , a senior Commission official , in Ireland last week when she said that the shine had gone off Ireland .
For example , the NorGer undersea electricity cable project could replace 60 nuclear power plants .
( Applause )
That is the only way to convince the citizens that Europe , more than ever , is their guarantee of a prosperous future .
( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I also supported and voted in favour of Mr Provera &apos;s report because I think it offers a practical , assertive step forward towards the goal of solidarity , which is moreover provided for by Article 80 on solidarity amongst European Union Member States .
This visibility should lead not only to social recognition but also to provision .
Let me tell you a few things about the West Midlands : we have the largest youth unemployment and our motor industry was decimated , partly due to the European Union funding jobs in Slovakia that took away essential jobs from the Ryton plant .
It should be remembered that Poland requested assistance for 594 workers made redundant in three companies in the manufacture of machinery and equipment division in the NUTS II region of Podkarpackie .
Indeed , the events that our southern neighbours are currently going through are resulting in high levels of migration to European shores .
Contrary to what the rapporteur says , there is no such thing as the &apos; right &apos; to emigrate .
Given my strong conviction that it is important for the EU to act directly on the causes of instability , partly by improving the use of the available instruments , I have no option but to vote in favour of the proposal .
Women must be given the opportunity to achieve a work @-@ life balance and village communities need to be preserved .
For this reason , the European institutions should take steps aimed at avoiding an exodus of women from the countryside , or in any case at encouraging the return of women to rural life .
Forty @-@ two per cent of these are women , and at least one agricultural business in five is managed by a woman .
Assistance in shutting down the plants in Lithuania , Slovakia and Bulgaria that were using obsolete technology contributes to minimising the consequences of the exceptional expenditure that their closure by 2013 entails .
Given the substantial cost of decommissioning these structures , it is only natural for the EU to support these countries in their efforts toward this decommissioning , so that no nuclear accident will occur in European territory , with consequences that are , unfortunately , well known to all of us .
I voted in favour of this report and of the amendment calling for a review of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ( EGF ) .
I therefore voted against this report , which raises a more general issue than that of the Unilever case .
In order to prevent abuses in the export sector , there are four types of export authorisations : the Community General Export Authorisations , National General Export Authorisations , Global Export Authorisations and Individual Export Authorisations .
When has it ever objected to the European Investment Bank financing projects outside of Europe which create unfair competition for European businesses , or which are socially and environmentally questionable ?
Domestic violence must not be treated as a private matter .
Today &apos;s report will make it possible to implement a criminal @-@ law instrument in the form of a European Union directive to combat gender @-@ based violence .
However men &apos;s violence against women knows no geographical boundaries , no age limit , no class or race or cultural distinctions , it is still invisible and the victims are silenced .
I agree with my friend and colleague Mrs Svensson when she states that women are victims of gender @-@ based violence ; however we must not view women , including those who are victims of this kind of violence , simply as victims .
President of the Commission . - Mr President , I will , of course , happily respond to Mrs Harms &apos; question even if I thought there was an agreement to have two halves to the debate today - a general part and then one on Japan .
She is a very committed European .
( FR ) Mr President , first of all something positive , Mr Barroso .
We all agree that there is a need for effective policy planning and implementation as well as for a strategic common approach .
However , the key competences continue to be at the Member State level .
in writing . - ( RO ) The new European Roma inclusion strategy only serves to rehash old objectives which have proved impossible to achieve over the years .
More bicycles could be provided for the employees and Members of Parliament here in Strasbourg instead .
It is not difficult to see what is essential : EUR 43 million on furniture , EUR 33 million on parliamentary assistants , EUR 18 million on temporary employment contracts , and EUR 7 million on information campaigns .
One point I would make before I conclude is that all this brings to mind the point which President Barroso has been making quite frequently : we do need to have a full and frank discussion on own resources and , perhaps , particularly project bonds , because the more finance the European Union can get independently , the less controversial budgets are going to be and the less we will be asking from the Member States .
Protection of Communities &apos; financial interests - fight against fraud ( debate )
To add insult to injury , the recent revelations about members of this House who agreed to amend or write legislation in exchange for payment further erode the credibility of this Parliament , particularly in its efforts to fight fraud and corruption .
A huge amount of patience and attention is being paid to this issue , and rightly so .
On the other hand , I would like to applaud the report for stating that the Czech Republic , along with Estonia , Latvia and Slovenia , had a zero level of fraud in drawdowns from the pre @-@ accession SAPARD fund .
Subject : Enabling technologies
We presented a plan of action in February 2009 and have since taken a number of measures .
I would also like to inform her that Mediterranean countries could also better prevent and detect pollution from ships by participating in EMSA &apos;s satellite @-@ based monitoring system , such as safe sea nets or clean sea nets .
For the future , important elements to consider in this context are a single entry point with common IT platforms , more standardised rules , a streamlined set of funding instruments that cover the full innovation chain , and simpler and more consistent procedures for receiving funding .
We want to act in such a way that we have broad protection , but the fact is that a lot of species in EU areas which have been identified as being endangered are in a pretty bad condition , so we would certainly have to do more .
We need to see parties that think and act in a European context instead .
Secondly , it brings organisational convergence between European political parties and European foundations , which is quite laudable , and thirdly it tightens and clarifies the funding of European political parties , which I think should be the goal for us all .
Small organisations should also be able to take part in the debate .
Furthermore , I welcome the move to facilitate the involvement of European political parties in campaigns for referendums relating to European issues at Member State level .
It would be unreasonable to allow a further extension after this new 18 @-@ month extension period for the current regulation .
I am gradually losing patience with the fact that the level of cooperation between the institutions is still so poor .
The tendency not to put a ceiling on how much EU vessels may catch in the waters of third countries is damaging and wrong .
For the Commission , it is very important to work on the substance because a good relationship with Greenland is an absolute political priority for us .
As time has gone by , the internal market has demonstrated its benefits to the consumer as well as to European businesses , and it has contributed to our economic growth .
For our part , we do not have any real levers for negotiation , insofar as our own markets are already considered , virtually as a matter of course , as being open .
I was surprised to hear the President speak about economic governance , which is still translated in German as Wirtschaftslenkung . This term is also used to mean central state control of the economy .
We all have a lot to do .
The fundamental factor is involvement , because Italy is different from Finland , and is different from Portugal .
To encourage the creation of a market for Europeans , greater coordination of trading activity should be a priority in order to control goods from third countries .
The free movement of goods , services , labour and capital drives innovation and increases the prosperity of the 500 million people who live in Europe .
It is enough to mention here the recognition of professional qualifications , e @-@ commerce and better conditions for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , although the list is , of course , much longer .
I believe that there is a triangle formed by citizens , undertakings and governance .
Several Members mentioned infrastructure bonds as well in the debate .
I am pleased that on the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Single Market , we have before us a resolution which will help Europeans make full use of the Single Market &apos;s potential .
15 . European international investment policy (
That new framework is planned for 2013 , and it is therefore necessary to extend the validity of the transitional technical measures until 31 December 2012 , bearing in mind that the current regulation will cease to be in force in 2011 .
We need to make sure that EU legislation is implemented across the board to reduce the barriers to trade , but also that we do not make EU legislation that increases the burden on our businesses .
I am in favour of this report , which aims to provide EU aid from the European Union Solidarity Fund for Poland , Slovakia , Hungary , the Czech Republic , Croatia and Romania , following the flooding in May and June 2010 that affected these areas and their populations .
Important areas such as tourism and industry were severely damaged .
The great advantage of this kind of protocol is that the European Union can help with these countries &apos; development .
The dispute settlement mechanism is modelled on standard international procedures .
The &apos; alternative &apos; model being proposed to us fits into the logic promoted within the World Trade Organisation which , in search of supposed efficiency , seeks to bypass national sovereignty , seeks to bypass the resolution of disputes through respect for each country &apos;s particularities , and seeks to bypass their right to defend their interests and those of their peoples .
This protocol will contribute to the creation of a clear framework for Ukraine &apos;s participation in the various European programmes so that in the future , EU @-@ Ukraine relations do not have the highs and lows they have had to endure hitherto .
On the one hand , their aim is to achieve greater harmonisation , improve international protection standards and enhance the quality and efficiency of asylum procedures .
Unfortunately , the report by Mrs Guillaume does not reflect those considerations , which led me , along with the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , to oppose it .
With the tabling of Communication COM ( 2010 ) 352 , the Commission aims to define a new policy framework for tourism in Europe , seeking to reinforce the sector through coordinated action at EU level that complements the Member States &apos; initiatives .
If we improve the quality of statistical reporting , based on reliable , comparative data , we will benefit from a solid foundation when it comes to making decisions on devising EU financial policies and instruments .
To respond better to real needs , we think it appropriate to clarify certain articles of the regulation and clarify the scope of certain financed measures .
This is precisely the reason why I think that a balance needs to be struck between catch limits , technical measures and the fishers &apos; needs .
The adopted budget has remained below 20 % of heading 5 , which has not happened for several years .
Considering the well @-@ known financial difficulties Member States are having , it is necessary to reduce costs and keep their growth below the current inflation rate .
I voted in favour of this document on the authorisation and refusal of authorisation of certain health claims made on foods and referring to children &apos;s development and health , because goods in the common market must be safe to consume , comply with standards , and be legal .
This report addresses the problems of future European international investment policy .
As the EU is the most &apos; open &apos; market in the world , we need to adopt a framework to protect our businesses and the relevant conditions that will bring about a balance with our basic trading partners , so that European undertakings enjoy similar competitive conditions .
In agriculture and cohesion policy in particular , the rate of recovery of outstanding amounts is &apos; catastrophic &apos; .
The only authentic way of representing the opinion and views of the electors of the Member States is a national political party .
I agree with the criteria for accessing funding , in particular , the percentage of revenue and the representativeness of the respective political party .
As I would argue that the funding of national parties by businesses and their lobbies should be completely banned , with public funding guaranteed by the state , I also believe that European parties should be funded from the EU budget and barred from receiving &apos; donations &apos; from legal persons .
The measures for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , which are to be provided with clear information about the internal market , are also extremely important .
National institutions also differ a lot in the ways that they are configured and in their organisational cultures .
The report contains many important proposals for the development of the Single Market .
I believe that of all the measures discussed and mentioned in the document we have adopted , two aspects are particularly important : lifelong learning and reducing unemployment for young people and the establishment and functioning of a single energy market .
I am certain that a well @-@ functioning Single Market will contribute to sustainable economic growth , so I endorse the resolution .
In this respect , I would like to highlight the particularly important role played by regional policy in the integration of the Single Market .
The European Council stated this clearly on 25 March .
There is a responsibility for the Commission , but there is also a responsibility for the Council to step forward and take its responsibility .
Secondly , we should support the environment in all ways possible and say &apos; no &apos; to the green scaremongers who have long been blackmailing Europe .
If you divide ten thousand years by the 400 nuclear power plants in the world , the result is 25 years .
Naturally , the second thing that Europe must do , also in the short term , what we can do , is constantly to reinforce our measures in the area of energy saving , and to place ever greater stress on renewable energy resources , making more use of wind , solar , water and biomass sources .
It is imperative , however , that these should exist .
It is a small but decisive common denominator which will ensure the highest possible levels of safety for countries with and without nuclear power .
Yes , we must phase out nuclear power - that is clear .
Journalists , whether national or foreign , are facing considerable difficulties in documenting the situation .
What is the EU doing specifically to foster this dialogue ?
Concerning the Saudi invasion in Bahrain , I would like to underline the fact that the six Gulf Cooperation Council states have a collective security agreement amongst themselves .
Sustainable development and long @-@ term equitable and inclusive growth are essential for each of these countries .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
Screening is an important technical process and the meetings have already identified sensitive issues and challenges in key chapters , such as agriculture , environment and fisheries .
We have to be careful when we talk about a small nation that we do not fall into a kind of big brother role .
Membership of the European Economic Area and the Schengen Area has contributed substantially to this progress .
Therefore , I fully agree with you that this instrument must be used as efficiently and effectively as possible .
Nevertheless , I must comment , in any event , that I do not agree with the position taken by Mrs Győri , but I do consider the views of Mr Füle and the deputy rapporteur to be realistic .
( DE ) Mr President , like Mr Swoboda , I would like to compare Croatia and Macedonia .
A return to the rule of law is now the first thing that needs to happen .
The combination of the International Criminal Court and the recent stance taken by the United Nations Security Council means that barbarous acts committed with impunity will soon no longer be the rule , but should hopefully become the exception .
They should find their expression in stronger joint commitments to the elements indispensable to democratisation .
Before the election , the political dialogue in our society had only just begun , but you blatantly nipped it in the bud straightaway .
( CS ) Madam President , I hope there is no one here from the countries of the Eastern Partnership , as they might think , on the basis of our numbers here , that we are not interested in the Eastern Partnership .
That has cost us in trust for Europe .
We left the more difficult questions for the strategic ENP review .
Granting a visa @-@ free regime to Russia would transform the Russian passport into a golden document sought after in Georgia , Moldova and Ukraine .
This holds true not only in Europe , but also in Egypt , Libya , the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries in Africa and the Middle East referred to in this resolution .
I would also like to welcome Mr Maystadt to this plenary because it is very important that the Commission also congratulate him and the EIB for his continued forceful response to the effect of the global financial crisis .
I think that you could make still more progress in reporting , in measuring these non @-@ financial benefits , which are at the very heart of your action and of your legitimacy .
First of all , I support , from an internal perspective , the European Investment Bank &apos;s policy for the development of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
I can assure you that cooperation between the Commission and the EIB is exemplary and excellent .
It will be easier for citizens to check whether a directive has been transposed into national legislation , and in what way .
I think that cofinancing of the vaccination programmes should also continue in the coming years , given their effectiveness and the new , much simpler legislative framework which we are debating today .
Concerning the Commission &apos;s readiness to implement this measure , I would like to assure Mr Schnellhardt and Mr Uggias that the Commission has done its part .
We will leave you with these questions .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to speak briefly just to underline the importance of the Wojciechowski report on bluetongue for an institutional issue which concerns us all .
I hope that we will soon succeed in organising a uniform energy policy that provides us with safe and sensible energy in the future , which means movement towards energy efficiency and renewable energies .
The protesters are demanding democracy in public life , the resignation of dictators and also , especially in Syria , the lifting of the state of emergency .
However , scientific advances have allowed the creation of new inactivated vaccines .
I therefore voted against it , otherwise I would have been voting against my own country Lithuania &apos;s energy strategy , the main objective of which is energy independence .
In an attempt to avert similar threats in the future , it would be right to consider implementing so @-@ called stress tests of nuclear plants in EU Member States .
I voted against the resolution on nuclear safety in Europe following the nuclear accident in Japan .
in writing . - I voted against the resolution in the final vote as I believe we need to debate this issue in the context of the overall EU energy strategy , not in the context of the Japanese nuclear tragedy .
in writing . - The situation in Syria , Bahrain and Yemen is an unpredictable ongoing process and not a bloody but unstoppable march toward democracy .
The European Parliament aims to make its contribution to the Fourth United Nations conference on the least developed countries through this resolution .
Iceland &apos;s accession to the EU would enhance the Union &apos;s prospects of playing a more active and constructive role in Northern Europe and in the Arctic , contributing to multilateral governance and sustainable policy solutions in the region .
The motion for a resolution on the 2010 progress report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , on which Parliament has voted , has been approved by a large majority and with the agreement of several political groups .
Those who are responsible must not go unpunished , and we must do everything in our power to identify and prosecute them , at an international level if need be , for crimes against the civilian population , whereby the EU will be able to provide the necessary support for the investigations .
Under Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union , the Union shall develop a special relationship with neighbouring countries , aiming to establish an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness .
In economic , trade and political terms , respect for rights and freedoms should be , at the same time , conditions and objectives of our cooperation .
Torture and rape often go unpunished because the authorities quietly drop the cases or , worse still , accusations of &apos; defamation &apos; are made against the women themselves .
I should like to record my satisfaction that the Cutaş report on the 2009 annual report of the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) has been approved .
Resolute action is needed .
I also wish to take this opportunity to salute the courage , fortitude and peaceful resistance of the Tibetan people whose example is an inspiration to us all .
Nepal needs to be reminded of its international human rights obligations to safeguard the democratic rights of the Tibetans , and it should not prevent free elections from going ahead .
That is why we defend those who struggle for human rights .
In recent months , many opponents of the Mugabe regime as well as NGO representatives have been arbitrarily arrested by the Zimbabwean authorities .
You have Syria , Ashraf , you have the Gualtieri report , the Albertini report , you have the problem of Europe as a global actor in the United Nations .
With reference to fuel prices , in order to address this situation , the Commission encourages the Member States to use fully the possibilities offered by the European Fisheries Fund .
Let us hope that the Commission is able to explore new avenues , concrete proposals , so as to be able to use the EFF to help the hardest @-@ hit sections of the fleet , which are small @-@ scale and artisanal coastal fishers , and those operating from remote ports .
We need to invest in research into cheaper engines that consume less oil .
Number two : keeping under review the possibilities for additional spectrum to meet the growing consumer demand for wireless broadband .
If we take a purely market @-@ based approach , then we are clearly in danger of giving priority - or excessive rights in any case - to market players which we know are able to distort the market on account of their size ; in other words , we know that small operators cannot always compete with them .
That is why it is important to make the point that , in discussing the 700 MHz band , we are not saying anything more than that we shall have the opportunity to take decisions later on the best way of using it .
We know with just as much certainty that it will be the European textile sector that mainly , if not exclusively , pays the price for this humanitarian aid .
We therefore consider it unacceptable to keep this proposal and we think that we will have to vote against it .
We have been asked : why textiles from Pakistan ?
We are not pursuing sanctions but cooperation in this area .
In the Committee on International Trade , they have consistently asked the Commission not to pursue the investment chapter until Parliament has given its opinion on what investment policy should look like , but now , in this resolution , they are calling on the Commission to go ahead without waiting for Parliament &apos;s opinion .
( PL ) Madam President , it seems to me that , as opposed to my fellow Members , I believe that the agreement will be very beneficial for India as well as the European Union at this juncture .
A path towards zero in the very long term , or a rather drastic reduction in the first few years ?
However , from the EU side , an agreement focusing on tariffs would clearly not be enough .
I do not intend to repeat what has been said about the need to predict the consequences in the bilateral area , or about the fact that we should avoid the mistake of first defining free trade priorities and then moulding European industrial policy to these as a dependent variable , or that the question of making a contribution to sustainability must be taken into consideration .
I understand that , in relation to the Commission proposal , the scope for such action is the most difficult issue - for Parliament and even more so for the Council .
The UK has a trade deficit with the EU and relies on negotiations with third countries , many of which have been in place for years and relate to our Commonwealth of Nations .
But we have over 2 000 parents , brothers , mothers and sisters in Cyprus who are suffering every day as they wonder about the fate of their loved one .
It therefore overturned the decision of the Supreme Court , which had again banned the Basque nationalist left from standing in elections .
I would like to highlight Article 23 in the report about stamping out illegal logging .
by Crescenzio Rivellini , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2009 , Section IX - European Data Protection Supervisor ( SEC ( 2010 ) 0963 - C7 @-@ 0219 / 2010 - ;
It cannot be justified , and that is why we should have the courage to discuss here openly whether this is a reasonable way to spend taxpayers &apos; money .
At the same time , our role as a Parliament is accountability towards citizens , so we have to make sure that taxpayers &apos; money is used properly , transparently and effectively .
It is therefore a policy coherence matter that we are talking about here .
It is of paramount importance that a minister assumes this responsibility and that these national management declarations have the signature of a political decision @-@ maker on them .
Instead , we would call on the Council to desist from boycotting Parliament and to answer the questions that we are asking about its accounts .
Our budget was not whiter than white , but greyer than grey and darker than dark and I am very unhappy about that .
Yet I see that Mr Becsey is with us , who has served his time in this Chamber , and who I think will be able to convince the Council that Parliament is the only democratically and directly elected body in respect of which the Council has a reporting obligation .
I believe it will provide us with a basis to at last have a more objective debate .
I consider the steps relating to the work of the Hungarian Presidency to be important .
I want to inform the Commission and the Council that this is the start of Parliament &apos;s campaign to win new rights for our citizens who are the victims of fraud .
Today we are allowing duties on textile products from Pakistan to be eliminated : it could then be the turn of India and then who knows which other State .
I agree with the rapporteur that the agencies concerned should step up their efforts to improve financial and budgetary planning and programming .
in writing . - ( PT ) I welcome and agree with the rapporteur &apos;s observations , and I congratulate the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union on the work it does .
Moreover , I agree on the need for the agency to put in place more precise mechanisms for setting its objectives and for evaluating the results .
These are serious failings which urgently need to be corrected .
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Maritime Safety Authority because , despite the previous absence of a multiannual programme and significant concern over the high number of budget transfers in 2008 , the Agency has shown improvements in its management and , taken as a whole , the Court of Auditors had a positive view of the annual accounts and the underlying transactions .
Parliament is concerned that the Court of Auditors has again highlighted cancellations and delays in procurement procedures , recurrent delays in the execution of payments and significant changes made to the work programme during the year .
The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Foundation &apos;s annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular .
We also need a mechanism for allocating the overall number of immigrants between all Member States .
Through today &apos;s resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009 .
The application of parliamentary immunity to such a situation is considered to constitute an undue extension of those rules , which are intended to avoid any interference with the functioning and independence of Parliament .
in writing . - ( PT ) Prespa Park , or the Prespa hydrographic basin , shared between Greece , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania , is extremely important for establishing a living habitat for the conservation of numerous rare and / or endemic flora and fauna species , also as a nesting place for birds threatened at global level , and as a place with a wealth of important cultural and heritage assets .
In 2005 , the FAO approved a series of measures that port states for fishing or fish @-@ transportation vessels must adopt to combat illegal fishing .
The millions of citizens and businesses that reap the benefits of the Internal Market must be able to exercise their rights and be able to travel , work and live freely anywhere in Europe .
Therefore , I voted in favour of this report , in which the European Parliament calls on the Commission to table legislative proposals on measures for the freezing and disclosure of the assets of debtors and alleged debtors in cross @-@ border cases .
The sugar plants played an important role in the agricultural sector , particularly in Ireland , where there were processing plants in Cork and in Carlow , and it could be argued that the reform put an end to the sugar sector in Ireland .
I am in favour of cutting costs related to the European Parliament .
Based on the information provided so far , there are internal breaches in this European institution , described as serious problems relating to the operation of its secretariat .
The shortcomings indicated in the report also need to be remedied , because the Agency is a source of important scientific advice , science @-@ based recommendations , and best practice for medicine evaluation and supervision in the Union .
Presented after the unprecedented floods that devastated last summer a vast portion of Pakistan &apos;s territory , the Commission &apos;s proposal seeks to extend autonomous trade preferences to this country concerning 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan ( mostly textile and clothing ) in the form of exemption from custom duties , with the exception of one product ( ethanol ) for which a tariff @-@ rate quota would apply .
Following the floods that devastated a vast portion of Pakistan &apos;s territory last summer , the Commission tabled a proposal to grant the country extensive autonomous trade preferences in the form of exemption from customs duties , affecting 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan : essentially textiles and clothing .
That is why we voted against .
As such , and since it is intended to seek to help the country overcome the economic and social difficulties suffered after the military conflict , I am voting to grant Georgia additional macro @-@ financial assistance , which I hope can be used to the real benefit of its population .
Those Member States more directly affected by these developments are receiving contributions of funding , equipment and technical expertise ; for example the Commission announced earlier that approximately EUR 25 million from emergency funds could be made available for Member States such as Italy and Malta .
I am confident that this House will support our approach and our efforts .
It has not gone under as yet .
This clearly needs to change because it is no longer tenable .
We have heard all the background as to why Schengen is being breached and we have waited since 1999 for any kind of common migration or asylum policy .
I have heard that there is still a possibility of it getting off the ground .
The EU success in promoting peace and freedom is without historical parallel but is now under high @-@ level attack .
We need to strengthen our rules , not to undermine them .
We are not talking about something insignificant , but about one of the fundamental principles of the EU ; freedom of movement .
The right tool for the job is criminal law .
This report is proportional in its approach ; it is useful and I believe it will do good .
That would create true transparency , greater credibility and ultimately greater trust .
The last point that was raised by several speakers and described by Mr Casini : the transparency register is definitely not a silver bullet or a magical solution to fight corruption .
It is our intention to deal with the links between health and nutrition in greater depth .
These are tragic figures but they pale into insignificance compared to the death toll on our roads .
1986 and the nuclear meltdown of an outdated nuclear power plant .
What we do have is a proposal from a body of which the Commission is not a member .
I think that they are very important , especially where the risk of marginalisation , of being locked out of employment opportunities , is a great social risk .
Therefore we should exploit this potential of the European budget to its limits .
We have taken a very important leadership role in the European Union with regard to food assistance by untying our food assistance or , in other words , not making it a requirement that European food assistance includes food produced in Europe .
In developing the climate and energy package , the Commission has taken due account of the different circumstances in the Member States in terms of economic development , wealth and energy mix .
I urged my fellow Members to fight the Council , and I use the word &apos; fight &apos; with good reason , because negotiations have not been at all easy .
Consumers have a right to know what chemical substances were used in the manufacture of a product , where the raw materials come from and other relevant information .
This evening &apos;s debate has certainly not been fruitless , because Mrs Győri clearly stated that the Council sets great store by the clause we are discussing - which is the key to today &apos;s policy debate - and that it is ready to reach a forward @-@ looking rather than a backward @-@ looking agreement with the Commission and Parliament in order to provide our citizens with real answers .
We need tools for anticipating problems as well as better governance in each of these establishments .
It was the banks who invested huge amounts of money without considering the risks , creating property bubbles in a number of Member States , who are now stricken by this crisis .
( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen I should like to thank you for your answer .
By creating tools , frameworks for governance , supervision , responsibility , transparency , everything that was lacking , everything that had been part of the very powerful tide of ultraliberalism that first swept through the world in the 1990s , everything that was partially dismantled , too , with the foolish idea that the markets could regulate themselves .
We should make every effort to improve our research activities in this area so that valuable materials can be segregated at the end of the product lifecycle .
- ( SK ) Mr President , it is a quarter to midnight and we are debating a serious matter : the exporting of toxic waste to developing countries .
Our Ambassador to Iraq arrives today , and she knows the importance that I attach to this issue .
That means we have to be more determined to act .
Soldiers who do not want to shoot at their own people are themselves shot by the secret services of the army and of Bashar al @-@ Assad .
Enlargement , support for civil rights and the establishment of the rule of law , diplomatic relations with the BRIC countries ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) , the Arab @-@ Palestinian conflict and condemnation of the bloodiest regimes are some of the subjects of the report that I am submitting to your vote .
Supporting better our delegations in Iraq , which some honourable Members discussed with me this morning , requires resources .
I would like to make an appeal : under no circumstances should a return to borders in Europe become a political tool or an attempt at a populist response to what may perhaps even be real problems .
We should not simply regard Turkey from the perspective of an accession candidate .
How can we have a common policy when one of the major EU countries actually votes in opposition to two other major EU countries ?
Madam President , can I start by congratulating the Vice @-@ President / High Representative on her personal success in negotiating the compromise in the United Nations on EU speaking rights , where others had failed .
First , we very often content ourselves with condemnation and making ineffective visa bans , which are ridiculously weak instruments .
Any conflict confirms this .
Mr President , only one remark : I think Ankara &apos;s increasingly active foreign policy poses new challenges and opportunities for European foreign policy .
Organising the Eastern Partnership summit for this autumn and setting up the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly are promising signs indicating that these guidelines are being implemented .
, in writing . - The protracted violent actions against the Coptic Church in Egypt and largely against Christians in the Middle East require an immediate response from the European Union .
Mr President , please excuse me .
If Brussels confined itself to cross @-@ border issues , then no one would have a problem .
I would call on both parties in this matter , in other words , both the EU and India , to try to find a solution to this problem that both respects copyright , because that is absolutely essential , and , at the same time , ensures that practical means are provided to enable the many poor people in India to obtain cheap medicines .
That was certainly the case in Northern Ireland , where the European Union played a crucial part through its support for the International Fund for Ireland , and that peace was copper @-@ fastened last weekend with successful elections .
Grouping together and simplifying all the existing legislation on indications or marks will facilitate controls and the identification of any illegal practice .
I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the installation , operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors .
As they are amended , it becomes difficult to understand which provision is currently in force .
In general , the report proposes that labels should show as much information as possible about the composition of the product and that we should call on the Commission to investigate whether imported products are damaging to human health due to their composition , in order to improve consumer protection .
At first reading , Parliament approved 63 amendments to the Commission proposal on a regulation on textile fibre names and related labelling of textile products .
In view of the proper decision to extend the regulation until 2015 , giving particular attention to Bosnia and Herzegovina and to Serbia , I confirm that I voted in favour .
This will contribute to the objectives that the Union has set itself , including that of bridging the digital divide , so as to ensure that all Europeans have broadband access by 2015 .
The aim is for the European telecommunications industry to regain its global leadership and increase productivity , cohesion , competitiveness and access to a single market .
I voted in favour of this report proposing that the register of interest groups should cover all the different European institutions .
It is useful to listen to the points of view of different stakeholders when the European legislator is drafting and adopting a piece of legislation .
This report , drafted by Mr Casini , concerns the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register .
In my opinion , this decision is an important step in increasing transparency and I am waiting impatiently for the EU Council to join the common register .
To this end , I welcome the conclusions and observations of the Green Paper and the opportunity to improve the governance of financial institutions through the Union .
The most important revelation to emerge from the financial and economic crisis was that we have an extremely greedy system .
Any free trade agreement the EU signs with India must in no way limit India &apos;s ability to produce generic medicines .
The negotiations with Japan , aimed at strengthening trade relations , cannot be used as a class weapon in the service of big financial institutions and companies , promoting the increased exploitation of workers and peoples , the destruction of their productive strength , and the destruction of the environment .
We have also highlighted the challenge that climate change presents to our forests .
We therefore urge the European Commission to continue along this route , by presenting a White Paper on forest protection to deal with these issues .
Forests , when they are well maintained , provide the main carbon sink and play a vital role in combating climate change .
One of these is the proposal for a uniform EU foreign policy .
We must not put unnecessary obstacles in the path of the European External Action Service ( EEAS ) to enable it to live up to its founding principles .
The militarisation of the EU is not in the interest of any of its peoples .
From this stems my support for a report that is necessary in order to evaluate advances made in the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and to identify what scope there is for improvement .
There is , therefore , an urgent need for the EU to be represented with a single voice in the various international bodies .
in writing . - I support the UK retaining membership of UNSC .
Welcome
The real key here is the banning of offspring .
It seems that by including cloned animals in this legislation , we have fallen into a trap . I must say that the way we have debated this issue has not been dignified .
I can assure you that the Commission services and I will pursue this challenge with all determination and energy , and I also assure you , especially Mr Staes , that I do not put off decisions that need to be taken .
If positive rhetoric could be converted into orders and cash in the bank , then the Union &apos;s SMEs would be in great shape .
Most recently , a new directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions came into force in March , which will make an important contribution to improving payment practice in Europe .
I would therefore suggest that the European Commission should become even more involved in efforts to ensure that the Member States implement these provisions .
Finally , I think that the Late Payments Directive has to be implemented fairly for SMEs .
It is a demanding but fair and necessary programme of adjustment .
These countries are still subject to a growing burden of interest .
( FR ) Mr President , I did not get a question but a circular argument from Mr Helmer , and Mr Helmer is simply wrong .
This is a loan that will be paid back in full , and at interest rates similar to the market rates Portugal was paying around a month ago .
If we do not do that , there is only one future , which is weak countries leaving the euro area .
As for the sacrosanct markets , they are now setting the tone .
( EL ) Mr President , the question pleases me , because I like evaluation , I like control .
On the question of how the agencies perform against the criteria that are set , I have to say that it is the role of the governing board of each agency to assess its performance against those criteria .
ICT skills depend on improvements in the quality of training , support for lifelong learning , and the opportunity for those already in employment to update their own knowledge and skills continuously .
on behalf of the EFD Group . - Mr President , I would like to thank Ms Merkies for all her efforts and her coordination during the period in which this report was being negotiated among the political groups .
Any failure in this area by Europe as a continent will have fatal consequences - as all the other Members have said - for the competitiveness of Europe , for the quality of life of its inhabitants and , ultimately , also for the values which Europe represents for the world .
We also need productive cooperation between the various stakeholders .
The Commission followed the discussions actively and facilitated coordination among the experts of the Member States during the first round of discussions at the ILO in 2010 .
We have come across cases , for example , of workers entering the country with diplomats and having their passport taken away ; people in that situation have virtually no freedom , have no access to assistance and do not know about their rights .
This is one way of circumventing minimum working conditions .
This is ultimately not a problem for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
To achieve this , the budget for the Food and Veterinary Office ( FVO ) and the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) must include the funds required to increase field work and to effectively monitor this problem .
In the development of the External Action Service it is important to mainstream and streamline the role culture has , and should have , in the EU &apos;s external actions .
Our goal is very much to create an environment in which every young person will be able to realise their potential .
Today , mobility essentially concerns students , but it should be encouraged for everyone , young workers and young people who are doing vocational training .
We have a wealth of culture and creativity in Europe which needs to be fostered and developed .
In specific terms , this is where we need to work to strengthen the opportunities for young people and , in so doing , invest in our young people .
Yet , at the same time , we want artists to be fairly paid , something that is not always the case in today &apos;s digital world .
They do not have the freedom to choose , however , as society places little if any value on the work of women in the home and in caring for children .
However , with all of that and culture , it will have the place it deserves in the world .
I think that cutting our budgets on education is a very short @-@ sighted policy .
In my opinion , it is no less important to have a permanent link between the requirements of the labour market and professional education , a link that has to be highly flexible in this regard , so that future graduates can be best placed on the labour market , bringing about a gradual reduction in unemployment among young people .
Perhaps the gravest concern of today &apos;s graduate youth in particular is that , following the completion of their studies , they are faced with not being able to capitalise on their knowledge on the labour market .
Building educational success is the focus of this report , and it is also the reason why we voted in favour .
The EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 increase of de minimis aid for companies for a period of only three years can help them in this complicated situation .
The exploitation does not just apply to those from outside the EU : we are also exploiting our own citizens .
The EU must deploy its own financial instruments to help young people , by using the European Investment Bank and European Investment Fund more effectively .
Popular common sense says that &apos; travel broadens the mind &apos; .
In this context , I lend my support to Mr Zver &apos;s report , which proposes a series of recommendations aimed at improving the education and professional training systems for young people .
The period from birth to the age of three is critical for children &apos;s brain development , physical and cognitive development , and for language acquisition .
There is also an economic rationale behind this , given the rise in the number of women on the labour market .
The next matter is the need to improve early childhood education and care services .
Public contracts represent important economic opportunities for companies , are very important in the promotion of the Single Market , stimulate innovation , and promote the protection of the environment and climate , as well as social inclusion .
In view of these facts , I believe that the European Commission must consider the means required to devise urgently and adopt suitable measures for easing the difficult economic situation which many European fishermen are in , also taking into account the financial difficulties currently facing a number of countries which have large fishing fleets .
Nonetheless , much more can be done to help European SMEs , specifically : the swift implementation by the Member States of the Late Payments Directive ; better Commission mechanisms for encouraging the Member States to apply the principles of the SBA ; adoption by the Member States , without delay , of the last remaining proposal on the European Private Company Statute ; the regular application by the Commission and the Member States of the SME test as part of impact assessments ; the urgently needed reduction of the bureaucratic and administrative burden on SMEs ; and putting &apos; Erasmus for young entrepreneurs &apos; on a permanent footing , with a sufficient budget .
We must encourage the Member States to adopt its guidelines so as to help SMEs at this time of crisis .
Increasing the pace of research and innovation is crucial for introducing a fair and competitive economic model , ensuring jobs for the future , moving towards sustainable resource management , facing up to energy challenges and stimulating a knowledge @-@ based society .
The Commission must monitor progress regularly , assessing obstacles and putting forward a mechanism to improve the regular provision of reports to the European Parliament and the Council .
The vast majority of the people employed in this sector are women and such work is undervalued , underpaid and informal .
The majority of these domestic workers are women and immigrants , who are easier to exploit and underpay .
Antimicrobial administration to both humans and livestock entails the risk of resistance when used incorrectly and at inadequate doses .
This report also has an underlying fallacy that keeps cropping up in EU discourse on culture : that there is a single European identity and a single European culture , and , even more so , that it is based on values like liberty , democracy , tolerance and solidarity .
This report contains several proposals to achieve this : the proposal to designate a person in every EU representation in third countries , for example , to coordinate cultural relations and interaction between the EU and those countries , or the proposal that the draft European External Action Service ( EEAS ) organisational chart contain posts tailored to cultural aspects and that a coordination unit be set up .
In view of the ever @-@ increasing importance of CCIs , as well as the objective of strengthening this sector , which is of strategic importance for the achievement of the Europe 2020 goals , the Commission should draw up a White Paper which would unlock cultural and creative potential .
I am voting for this motion for a resolution , and would express the same conviction as the rapporteur that awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century would be an important step towards transcending historical European divisions and showcasing the new Europe .
We call on the government there to respond positively to the recommendations of the UN &apos;s panel of experts , which highlighted war crimes and crimes against humanity on the parts of both the Sinhalese and the LTTE .
The victor is not always right , although they always try to prove they are right .
We want President Aliyev to keep his word .
Written statements ( Rule 149 )
Belarus has a responsibility to safeguard its citizens &apos; human rights and respect them .
The crackdown is now further intensifying , with a number of ongoing trials against ex @-@ presidential candidates and most of the remaining detained activists .
This is a slight change to the agenda .
There was disagreement about whether statistics can also be produced for the marine environment , in other words , statistics on the status of fish stocks .
Or , as far as you are concerned , does that also fall within the realm of Sovietisation in the United Kingdom ?
Above all , they must not be decoded , because data protection is also clearly justified .
The Commission is of the view that it is in the common interest of Europe , the Union and its Member States , to move progressively towards a single seat for the European Union , or at least the euro area , in the IMF .
There is nothing here that will surprise you ; it is there to promote balance , growth , exchange rate stability , to lessen disequilibrium and to help countries that are in trouble .
The reality is that the EU punches below its weight at global level , be it at the G20 , IMF or WTO .
The rapporteur also mentioned the EUR 28 billion still to be spread over the remaining three years .
I am not going to go over their assessment of our Seventh Framework Programme : that it is indispensable but too complicated and too bureaucratic .
I think one of the striking things we have experienced is that the mobility we can achieve via the framework programme is creating the special climate and the special preconditions for excellence .
Thank you for discussing the issue of simplification ; we have taken note of your comments .
EU governments will continue to have the option of imposing universal public service obligations on private operators and of subsidising public services as necessary .
It is precisely this trade in services that several people have made out to be problematic , but this is clearly one of the most important strategic areas we have , particularly when it comes to financial services .
In any event , Canada is fighting to secure free trade and a liberalised system of investments under this agreement for oil mined from tar sands .
The debate is closed .
Memoranda like the one the troika of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the Commission drew up with Portuguese officials demanded anti @-@ social policies , including amendments to redundancy and privatisation laws , and attacks on public and universal social security which can only lead to social regression , condemning workers and the public to unemployment , poverty , underdevelopment and extreme dependency .
Big protests should be organised right across Europe against austerity on that day .
The amending regulation became effective on 1 June 2011 .
I would ask all Members for their forbearance with regard to the current discrepancies , as the display is not working .
Funding to improve people &apos;s access to basic health and education must be ring @-@ fenced by including a clear benchmark .
Many cross @-@ border orders - as many as 61 % of the orders on the online market - fail to be completed for this reason .
During the current economic and financial crisis where the unemployment rate , especially among young people , has exceeded the 20 % mark at EU level and even 30 % in some Member States , improving vocational education and training must become a priority for the European Union .
The first concerns references to bans on certain products .
Consumers have a right to know how their food has been produced and where it comes from .
( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , farmers can be compensated , but human life cannot be recovered .
The EHEC situation has thrust local vegetable growers into an existential crisis completely out of the blue and through no fault of their own .
We extend expressions of sympathy to the families of the victims and to those who are ill , but let us remember to provide compensation to the farmers from a number of countries who have suffered losses .
Because of this , the crisis has turned into hysteria .
The European Commission yesterday proposed compensation of EUR 150 million for vegetable growers who suffered damages as a result of the intestinal infection in Germany .
However , the position followed by the Commission in this file shall not be considered as a precedent .
The UK media avoid EU reality , brains are fed with TV soaps and reporters say the EU does not affect local issues .
In my view , a very complicated mechanism is being introduced , not least for calculating the amount to be charged .
Thus , finance ministries will allocate the funds as they see fit according to the interests of their countries , within the wide sphere of infrastructures .
The agreement contains a detailed recommendation for Member States , precisely with respect to the utilisation of revenues , and states , inter alia , that 15 % of generated revenues - and I emphasise this for Mrs Meissner in particular - should be used to finance trans @-@ European transport projects .
( For the results and other details on the vote : see Minutes )
I voted in favour of this report because its primary aim is to repeal the EU regulation currently in force , laying down additional requirements proving the origin of textile products imported into the EU , thus simplifying the legislation in force and creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses .
The legislation being repealed in this case concerns the conditions of acceptance of proof of origin for certain textile products originating in third countries , which established specific requirements by applying quantitative restrictions .
It is stipulated that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction ( EMCDDA ) shall be open to the participation of any third country that shares the interests of the Union and its Member States in its objectives and work .
Moreover , a sound legal basis for its participation can be found in Article 21 of Regulation ( EC ) No 1920 / 2006 establishing the Centre , which opens the Centre &apos;s doors to third countries that share its aims and interests .
Global navigation satellite systems ( GNSS ) can have important and extremely useful applications for all modes of transport .
Today , we voted during the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on the report on transport applications of Global Navigation Satellite Systems .
Of these , the international air transport agreements are of particular importance , given the various security and coordination needs involved .
I voted in favour of Mr Simpson &apos;s report on international air agreements under the Treaty of Lisbon , bearing in mind that Parliament now has a greater share of responsibility when it comes to negotiating international agreements .
It is estimated by the Irish Exporters Association that a truck travelling from Ireland to mainland Europe via Holyhead and Dover will incur a road use charge of EUR 120 and an external cost of EUR 30 .
It will also give Member States more opportunities to make their respective national road pricing systems more efficient , which means a better instrument for transport demand management .
In its June 2006 conclusions , the European Council called on the Union and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development .
I voted in favour as I support the idea of the necessary statistical instruments , although I reject the policies that they serve .
He said it is necessary for this mechanism to be able to provide countries with flexible credit lines .
The debt problems are not exclusive .
Here , we may have completely different points of view .
Mr President , I am glad that you raised at the G8 summit the issues of the problems of the eurozone .
They want a good constitution , they want to build their country , and they are telling us , &apos; we will have money , don &apos;t worry , but help us - be there &apos; .
In the Abyei region , he has started to massacre citizens .
The occupation of the disputed Abyei region by Sudanese government forces on 21 May and the violence which continued yesterday , as well in Kadugli , show us that the civil war between north and south can reignite at any time .
The vote will take place on Thursday , 9 June , at 12 : 00 .
Nor should we set conditions for Romania and Bulgaria that we do not ask of the other Member States in order to form part of this area of freedom .
This is particularly important at the moment when there are internal challenges from and fears among our citizens about illegal immigration , which may threaten security and social advantages in Europe .
( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , Schengen is certainly an heirloom of civilisation of the highest value .
I would like to express my thanks to the Commissioner that when Denmark wanted to bring in border controls , a communication on common asylum and immigration policy was released very quickly .
Yes , there is corruption in Bulgaria and Romania , but there is corruption in every Member State , and the Commission proposed only yesterday a report on how we want to enforce the struggle against corruption .
We have a duty to our citizens to take Europol &apos;s warnings seriously .
Let me give you a few examples .
We are not there yet , but there is a lot of progress in Kosovo and we are working very closely with the government in order to support them and help them make progress .
You very rightly reminded us that negotiations on the resettlement of refugees from third countries are imminent .
However , Article 51 of the Charter states that its provisions are addressed to the institutions , bodies , offices and agencies of the EU , with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity , and to the Member States only when they are implementing EU law .
This was the same finding as in previous years .
I would be very pleased to see the spirit of the Polish Presidency , as evident in the draft published by the Polish Presidency , shaping Europe in the coming years with the spirit of cooperation it proposes .
Mr President , it is always interesting to see that , as soon as we start talking about a forward @-@ looking budget , the debate is only ever about &apos; how much exactly ? &apos; .
( NL ) Mr President , I thank my fellow Member for the question .
The fact is that I am not just a member of the Christian Democratic Union , but have also been Vice @-@ Chair of the CDU in Schleswig @-@ Holstein for 13 years .
He said he wanted to have a meeting with Callaghan - I think it was - the British Prime Minister , on some issues and Callaghan said why not combine this with a good game of golf ?
In Jorge Semprún , we celebrate someone who was imprisoned in Buchenwald concentration and extermination camp , someone who fought Nazi forces in France and the Franco dictatorship in my country , Spain .
Mr President , the mocking of Her Majesty &apos;s Government by Mr Verhofstadt when he shared with us his logic as to why Britain should hand over more money and more power to the EU was further evidence of the palpable disdain in which the UK , its national government and its citizens are held by some in this House .
There is a realisation in this report that , without a cohesion and agricultural policy that is robust and strong in terms of its budget , this objective will not succeed .
We need to further increase research and science , but we also need to increase the amount of science and research in regional funding .
( PL ) Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on having drafted such an excellent report on the Multiannual Financial Framework .
I support the idea that all the funding provided by the EU should help improve the general state of the European environment .
In practical terms , much better coordination of the programmes is required , concentrating on their complementarities .
( IT ) Mr President , I should like to express my overall satisfaction about the adoption of Mr El Khadraoui &apos;s report .
( DA ) Mr President , there is broad consensus in Parliament on the need to reform our research programme .
Certificates , brands and standards are important for consumers , and image and reputation are directly linked to a company &apos;s success .
The current economic and social challenges that we face need to be reflected not only in impressive speeches but , first and foremost , in concrete budget chapters .
Given his experience in this area , I believe I can safely endorse his evaluation , and his demands for external border security .
in writing . - It seems that Romania and Bulgaria have proved that they are , to a sufficient extent , ready to fulfil the Schengen acquis .
The European Parliament should play a key role in this process , and it must be kept up @-@ to @-@ date with the situation in Bulgaria and Romania .
Regardless of future changes to how the Union is represented within the UN , and in the Security Council - a debate which is still open - in particular , there is increasingly a need to join up the efforts of European countries so as to , alongside the Union &apos;s representatives overseas , encourage a collective capacity for intervention and influence .
Therefore , transparency must be increased and the administrative burden reduced so that more SMEs would be interested in becoming involved in programmes in the future , to ensure the Union &apos;s effectiveness in relation to research , development and innovation .
There is a need to enhance , stimulate and secure the financing of research and development in the European Union via a significant increase in relevant expenditure from 2013 onwards , because such an increase in funding , ideally by increasing the budget , must foster sustainable growth and competition via excellence .
Given the importance of knowledge @-@ based industries to Europe and our thriving R &amp; D sector , we cannot afford to wait until FP8 to take action .
While this method allows certain public services to be excluded on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis and at the request of each Member State by establishing a &apos; negative &apos; list , it nevertheless runs the risk of potential omissions .
At the present time , the trade system of the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) seems to be the best way to offer a reference framework for economic relations between states .
This is a change that should go hand in hand with the Commission &apos;s assessment of the need for greater disclosure of information for all products in the field of financial instruments .
Furthermore , there is a need to increase supervisors &apos; responsibilities , capacity , powers and resources for monitoring , assessing and overseeing the adequacy of the internal models , for imposing prudential measures and conducting investigations and inspections .
The EU has set itself the objective of not only becoming a pole of excellence on corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) but also of promoting CSR in its external policies .
This report contains some positive aspects : the denouncing of multinationals &apos; constant disrespect for workers &apos; rights and decent work , and the need to horizontally integrate social policy in all European Union external policy , including so @-@ called corporate social responsibility ( CSR ) .
This includes EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries .
However , as long as this remains the case , it will also be necessary to lay down requirements specifying what these trade agreements are to contain .
We need to work effectively and quickly in order to give some dignity back to these young people , who want to work and , above all , become part of a world in which they are unlikely to be accepted with open arms .
Achieving these objectives will only be possible if all stakeholders ( European institutions , Member States , local and regional players ) join forces .
The labour market increasingly requires mobile , flexible people with international experience .
2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from four years of operation of Regulation ( EC ) No 1905 / 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation ( DCI ) .
In my opinion , it is equally important to establish the procedures and structures which will protect development as an independent area of policy with its own specific objectives .
Furthermore , it is particularly important for decisions on the general objectives , the priority areas and the allocation of funds to be taken using the delegated acts procedure , pursuant to Article 290 TFEU .
I do not know whether the solutions put forward by the rapporteur are the right ones .
It is , therefore , crucial to adopt any measures that might strengthen the guarantees that IAs will be transparent and independent , since that will help maximise this instrument &apos;s role as an aid to the decision @-@ making process , and as a guarantee of the quality and suitability of the EU institutions &apos; activities .
However , all this is an attempt to dress up the product in order to hide its real dangers from the electorate .
I believe SMEs are crucial for economic recovery in many Member States .
This will allow us not only to define the quality of life more accurately , but these indicators will also provide a more reliable knowledge base , which will contribute to a better analysis of the policies in different areas .
Nowadays , gross domestic product is no longer a sufficient , appropriate indicator for measuring progress , and it is therefore necessary to develop more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base in an ever changing world .
I hope that this will provide more comprehensive information for developing policies .
Space policy and the GNSS programme are of strategic importance and should provide tangible benefits for citizens and businesses .
The EU must have adequate resources and a strong Multiannual Financial Framework if it is to achieve those goals and meet the needs of the people of the Union .
However , the strategy will only be successful if it has budgets corresponding to its actions and objectives .
Even though the European Parliament &apos;s report on Investing in the future : a new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe contains many ideas that should be supported , I did not support it because I believe that it damages the European Union &apos;s image in the eyes of its residents .
However , I believe that it is unwise to propose the introduction of a tax on financial transactions in the European Union alone .
When the European Parliament voted on Wednesday 8 June on investing in the future : a new Multiannual Financial Framework ( MFF ) for a competitive , sustainable and inclusive Europe , I chose to vote against the report .
That is surely why this revision of the Hungarian constitution is being debated in the European Parliament and has been the subject of consideration by two of this House &apos;s committees in particular , namely , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs ( AFCO ) and the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs ( LIBE ) .
Secondly , one has to ask what power , what competence , do we have to bring the issue of a national constitution to the European Parliament in the first place ?
The European institutions are also responsible for ensuring that Member States comply with these principles after accession , as well .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue @-@ card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
This has helped the situation more than it has detracted from it and we now have a better relationship with the United Kingdom than ever before , expressed by the visit of Queen Elizabeth two weeks ago .
Secondly , we , MEPs , cannot have a say in a matter of national competence .
Vice @-@ President of the Commission . - Madam President , I had asked to have a clear line from the European Parliament .
I think we need to reconsider that .
But merely opting into it and to the concept of it , as has been done by the government , is not , of course , the final shout .
We are now in the area of moving from the reports to the action , and we have a situation where we have two hard cases .
We must reinstate the requirement that a court will extradite a person only when there is compelling evidence that a serious offence under the extraditing country &apos;s laws has been committed .
All of these can , must and are being dealt with .
We will emphasise the need for further reforms in the Russian electricity and gas sector with a view to establishing a level playing field .
On these aspects , we should do everything we can within the context of the Partnership for Modernisation to help their roots to spread across Russia and develop .
Russia &apos;s discrediting of shale gas extraction projects is causing additional alarm .
I feel that EU and Russian relations with Belarus should also be discussed .
I believe that the Russian authorities should be told that although vegetables and gas are important , they must stop supporting Transnistrian separatists , that we expect them to stop supplying weapons to Azerbaijan and Armenia , since this poses a great risk for the future of this region , and that we also expect Russia to fulfil its obligations under the agreement on Georgia concluded in 2008 .
Madam President , I have a point of order under Rule 96 by prearrangement with the President , whom I would ask to write to the Formula One Teams Association - including Lotus in my own constituency - which made clear in a letter yesterday that it objected to a rearranged Bahrain Grand Prix on logistical grounds .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am very grateful for the information you have given .
We have established that the thresholds were incorrectly applied , that no screening process was carried out and , therefore , that the environmental impact has not been assessed objectively enough .
on behalf of the ALDE Group . - Madam President , I would say to the Commissioner that over the last number of years , I have met many Irish citizens who have been victims of misleading business directory companies .
Despite the fact that , as I understand it , it was asked to cease trading by the high court in Catalonia in 2001 and was found to be guilty of misleading practices in the Belgian courts and by the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading , it continues to trade .
As the worldly @-@ wise person in the middle , I know I am in the right place .
( DE ) Madam President , firstly , the reason why I reacted so strongly is that I am still annoyed that we have not managed to adopt a joint resolution on safety , because it was more important for some people to take up an absolutist position rather than to find common ground .
( The speaker agreed to take a blue @-@ card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
( The speaker agreed to take a blue @-@ card question under Rule 149 ( 8 ) )
( PT ) Madam President , Commissioner , I am directly addressing the proposal you have brought before Parliament today and I will tell you totally frankly that I think some of us are entitled to be disappointed with this proposal , because the proposal being tabled is not just weak but also has huge gaps .
However , that obviously should not exempt the European Commission from its duty to continue badgering Member States about this and to maintain pressure on the national security services so that these services actually investigate whether the plants are going to be prepared for those risks , too .
( Applause )
the tests being applied should take into account the nuclear technology used at the power plant , which may include special characteristics that it has , without having to use test &apos; templates &apos; ;
In Russia , they obviously have to ensure that the dual identity that people could buy there previously can no longer be obtained .
I would therefore like to stress the importance of maintaining the Union &apos;s humanitarian aid to Sudan and to South Sudan .
These plans will also have to deal with the difficult issue of borders in order to ensure that a peaceful and viable coexistence of the two states can be maintained .
At meetings with the Russians , we must speak very firmly about press freedoms in Russia .
Therefore , the Commission must immediately review and improve the directives in order to avoid these practices .
The European Union must implement these measures for the Internal Market to be able to function normally , for consumers to be protected , and for business operators to be able to engage in fair business practices .
However , the efforts to find solutions must not be abandoned .
2 . Guantánamo : imminent death penalty decision ( debate )
Mr al @-@ Nashiri was imprisoned in Poland in a secret prison set up by the CIA where he was subjected to intense torture .
Deplorably enough , however , in the joint motion for a resolution , we do not find a single word of condemnation of the United States authorities or of the European countries that were complicit with them in this activity .
I would like to ask Mr Gahler if he is willing to declare that he is in favour of giving such a political perspective to Ukrainian society and to politicians of all persuasions and that the road to the European Union is open to them , and if he will endorse statements of this kind in the European Parliament .
This represents a criminalisation of political opponents of the government in office , aimed solely at eliminating and silencing the opposition .
Documents received : see Minutes
To that end , partnerships will be developed with Southern Neighbourhood countries .
We , the Commission , can put this in place , bilaterally with the government , but I believe efforts are necessary from all those that can contribute , namely in terms of technical assistance coming from different Member States .
It is not on the table today either in the Council or in Parliament .
However , I also believe that tax evasion , unfair bonuses and all the factors that helped to cause the financial crash have not as yet been addressed .
For example , we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that , with European support , Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year .
Democracy ?
( FR ) Mr President , I too would like to offer my warm congratulations to Minister Győri , President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council , on her Presidency .
But this is not helping us .
It is indeed our firm belief that deeper integration is the solution to our common problems .
In this context , I would call on the European Commission either to uphold its resolute opposition to a reintroduction of border checks or to establish joint , uniform and reasonable rules , criteria and mechanisms for a possible reintroduction .
The contribution from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety is an important one in this context , because we want the same things European citizens do .
Large farms need to deliver more when it comes to jobs and the environment .
The idea of making agriculture more scientific , of moving away from productivist industrial farms , is now enshrined in the texts .
The agricultural sector provides clear added value to the European economy .
I hope that the future legislative proposal will provide a solution for getting rid of the unfair disparities .
That is the kind of instruments that we will be proposing .
The milk crisis made it clear that measures to restrict production are needed in the milk sector .
If these issues are not resolved , the pact becomes stupid , as someone said .
Our group , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party ( Christian Democrats ) , is satisfied with the results we have achieved so far in the legislative package on economic governance .
At the same time , the already existing comply @-@ or @-@ explain procedure would be enhanced .
To put it bluntly , it simply failed to pull the ripcord .
We are waiting to see , therefore , whether these new measures prove any more useful .
Specifically , we need : the issuance of common European bonds , the outright rejection of competition between the bonds issued by the different Member States , the establishment of a genuinely European treasury and the harmonisation of fiscal policies to ensure equality , combat tax fraud and help to define a progressive European social policy based on efficient public services .
During the trialogue , the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations .
In other words , your economic model does not work .
Solidarity between EU Member States must be accompanied by a sense of responsibility and must respect rules that Member States cannot and must not knowingly violate .
That is the basic message of this excellent report produced by Mrs Wortmann @-@ Kool .
I can provide you with my interpretation and the Commission &apos;s interpretation of this issue which in fact , if you look at the texts , is extremely complicated .
I think that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough , as they are only geared towards austerity and curtailing citizens &apos; social rights .
However , for technical reasons or in case of new technological solutions , such fuel could be extracted , processed or recycled and reused .
These are extremely costly activities , involving facilities that will operate for decades , if not centuries .
( HU ) Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , every Member State produces radioactive waste .
A transparent process must be used for informing the general public .
As such , measures to suppress the problem , if possible within the framework of an ambitious international strategy , must be improved in conjunction with measures to combat its root causes .
This very clearly indicates that there is a fundamental shift in the debate on climate policies .
If we in the Commission and in the European Union had taken energy efficiency more seriously at an earlier stage , the question of the automatic mechanism would probably not have arisen .
Poland cannot afford to increase the target for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to 30 % .
We warmly thank our rapporteur Francesca Balzani , as we know how strongly she promotes the standpoint adopted by the committee in the trialogue .
The letter from the Presidents and Prime Ministers of the five solid and solvent countries should not be forgotten and pushed aside .
The budget is , indeed , the basic , fundamental tool that supports all EU policies - common agricultural policy , cohesion policy , research policy and foreign policy .
However , please note that we also do not want an independent European Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
I would like to thank the European Parliament and , in particular , the rapporteurs Mr Pieper , Mr Mikolášik , Mr Vlasák , Mrs Sanchez @-@ Schmid and Mr Stavrakakis for their excellent reports , which will help us to make progress with our work .
This is what the European Parliament is aiming to achieve with Mr Pieper &apos;s report .
( FR ) Madam President , I welcome this debate a few days from the final deliberation of the College of Commissioners on the next financial perspectives and the revision of the regulations governing the Structural Funds , including the European Social Fund .
Secondly , we need a renewed framework for this policy , one that is adapted to the new situations and challenges .
In view of the dangers associated with unemployment among young people and with demographic changes it is crucial to achieve full use of the potential of the European Social Fund ( ESF ) , and that requires the creation of conditions to achieve better coordination of the ESF with other instruments at regional and local level .
Mr President , honourable Members , firstly I would like to express my thanks for the commitment you have shown in this comprehensive debate involving a large number of speeches .
Furthermore , it contributes significantly to achieving the Europe 2020 goals , although it is important to emphasise that cohesion policy is only one of the means of achieving these goals , and every policy field must contribute to an appropriate extent to the success of the new growth strategy of the European Union .
We stand shoulder @-@ to @-@ shoulder with your country and with you .
We will continue the negotiations and at the beginning of July , we will take a final vote on the report after negotiation .
It is often the case that a problem is impossible to address due to a lack of money .
I also have a positive opinion of the final version of the provisions of Chapter 5 on prohibited contractual terms .
It is therefore important that , when establishing direct assistance models and supporting rural development , priority must be given to sustainable agriculture and various environmental aspects , including ecological farming .
I also welcome the appointment of a man who has all the qualities required to fill such a post .
On 14 April 2011 , the Commission adopted a new draft decision on the mobilisation of the EGF in favour of Belgium , with the aim of supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the global economic and financial crisis .
Some doubts were raised about the implementation of this new form of cooperation between committees , which were referred to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs .
We note the fact that fishing opportunities have been reduced by half and that the cost of licences has been increased to EUR 40 000 for tuna seiners , although there has been an increase in the number of these ships covered by the agreement .
The conclusion of fisheries partnership agreements certainly has the aim of conserving and safeguarding the activities of the European fishing fleet .
The Principality of Andorra is historically linked to the EU in all manner of areas .
Airlines will also benefit from the Agreement , since it provides for the use of each other &apos;s approved repair and maintenance facilities .
The EU @-@ Canada Air Transport Agreement , signed on 17 @-@ 18 December 2009 and which will finally establish a full Open Aviation Area between the EU and Canada , will be the subject of a separate recommendation .
Countries like Portugal are drifting ever further from the promised economic and social development that would move them closer to the EU average .
I am voting for this report , as it examines the needs of urban areas , focusing mainly on two aspects : basic infrastructure , and smart investment in infrastructures and services based on technological advances .
As a result , we were able to vote in favour of the report as a whole .
Although almost 70 % of the population of Lithuania live in cities and suburban areas , my country nevertheless lacks a clear , integrated and sustainable approach .
Last but not least , this report highlights one important fact . This is the need to attract , encourage and involve partners from the private sector with a view to achieving this territorial cooperation , since many services or infrastructures are operated and owned by partners in this sector .
I voted in favour of the report on increased effectiveness between the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) and the other Structural Funds as I believe that the development of a strategic framework could ensure a common approach and capitalise on synergies between the various existing funds , with a view to achieving the objectives of cohesion policy as defined by the Treaties , thus meeting the expectations of citizens .
In particular , I would like to draw attention to the need for simplification of the procedure of applying for funds , at both national and regional level .
in writing . - ( LT ) I welcomed this document , because this procedure should put in place an alert mechanism for the early detection of emerging macroeconomic imbalances .
Financial consolidation is essential for correcting the errors of the past , and for a sustained growth of Europe &apos;s economies that is not supported by public and foreign debt , but rather by the promotion of employment and competitiveness .
It represents clear contempt for the principle of subsidiarity .
It is also part of the European Union &apos;s crusade against national independence and sovereignty .
In this case , it is on the regulation on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area .
This should not be interpreted , however , as meaning that I do not fundamentally support some elements of these amendments .
All actors have to be fully involved and informed at all stages to ensure preventing problems and finding solutions at earliest moment possible .
The report deals with enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area .
The new competences conferred by the Treaty of Lisbon have led to new responsibilities and the Council will not be able to make a final decision on the entire package without Parliament &apos;s agreement .
At the same time , in order to protect retailers and service providers , the report provides for consumer obligations , such as covering the cost of postage when returning goods to the seller , and in the case of provision of services , the recipient will have to pay for the service share that has already been provided .
By adopting this proposal for a directive , which replaces four existing directives with one , we hope to improve the regulation of consumer protection and guarantee everyone a minimum level of protection .
Providing this information will give consumers confidence and encourage them to engage in cross @-@ border shopping , providing them with better choice and value .
These amendments are overdue - the original directives anticipated the digital revolution , but today consumers shopping online do not have adequate protection .
While we may not be satisfied , we shall vote in favour of the directives on account of the extremely tight deadlines : exceeding them would render the directives meaningless .
The authorisation for an EU State to export its waste to another Member State only through a bilateral agreement provides the appropriate framework for nuclear and environmental safety .
Why did I do that ?
In this context , we need to support research , development , innovation and SMEs and the development of resource @-@ efficient technologies .
The European Parliament must allocate payments more fairly among countries and among European farmers .
Indeed , we want to see the EU &apos;s agricultural budget remain unchanged until 2020 to encourage farmers to guarantee the security of food supplies and the protection of the environment , to create new jobs , and to ensure a competitive agricultural sector .
This report , which I fully support , does well to highlight the value of agriculture , from both a food and a rural development and land preservation point of view .
In the face of all these challenges , the solution can only be found at European level .

4 . EU @-@ Jordan Euro @-@ Mediterranean aviation agreement (
We note that the situation is changing every day . We see that the French Government has sent a mediator .
One would have hoped the lessons from SAVE I would be learnt .

I repeat , if we want to be credible we must combat all the many forms of fraud which abound within the Union and which prompt nationalist reactions .
Madam President , I should like to start where the rapporteur has left off .
The area I wish to concentrate on particularly is responsible self @-@ medication .
This is an industry which , as Mrs Peijs pointed out , was until recently a world leader , playing a prominent role in research and development and in the creation of new jobs .
It is certainly a sector that is still worth fighting for , but subsidies are not the answer , nor are they what it wants itself , thank goodness .
In my country 60 % of prisoners are behind bars because of drug dependence , and 40 % of that 60 % have the AIDS virus .
We should therefore discuss more among ourselves and benefit from national experiences , both negative and positive .
As the Intergovernmental Conference opens - a conference which has set itself the particular objective of drawing closer to Europe &apos;s citizens - the subject under discussion is one of concrete and , unfortunately , daily concern to our citizens .
I hope that everyone who is following the debate today will also be listening when this question is discussed on Thursday , not because I am the rapporteur , but because the drugs problem cannot be tackled effectively without alternatives for the countries where drug crops are grown .
But in this case we were misled for the simple reason that the rapporteur did not speak on behalf of his committee , but on behalf of his group .
Everything that can promote information , prevention and education , prophylaxy and treatment , whether in the younger age bands , where appeals to consumption take place at ever earlier ages , or within families , schools or at work , or through actions aimed at risk populations ( including prison inmates ) , or aimed at public opinion in general , can count on our support and approval .
And then there &apos;s an entirely separate matter : the closure of mines in England where a Conservative government asked for low interest loans and then discovered that perhaps they would not use the loans after all and repaid them .
I cannot help thinking that the Commission is in danger of becoming the Council of Ministers &apos; lackey , instead of the guardian of the Treaty and protector of the European taxpayer .
We cannot do the job of the Commission .
The fines are then against the Member States .
On this subject , you will remember the discussions on the discharge in question , which was postponed for more than a year .
Will the Council now please as a matter of urgency exercise its responsibility to ensure that the funds of the EDF are properly accountable .
On the contrary , it expresses doubts about the continuation of that Centre &apos;s operation - CEDEFOP &apos;s operation - related to its productivity and efficacy .
The Committee on Budgetary Control , based on a report by Mr Wynn , recommends giving discharge to the Commission with regard to the general Community budget for 1994 .
Madam President , on this point I fully support what Mrs Theato has just said .
Under the Treaty on European Union police cooperation is an issue of common interest .
You know that the IGC is also to have detailed discussions on the decisionmaking process in matters of foreign and security policy .
A further reason for doing so is the fact that the die is cast in Switzerland , and we must be prepared for a de facto end to road transport transit through that country : alternatives are therefore necessary .
The PHARE programme already co @-@ finances the continuation of some of these axes beyond the European Union border to Durres and to Sofia .
If so , then I can vote for the regulation .
I therefore protest formally against the systematic bypassing of this House and insist once again upon our contractually guaranteed participatory rights .
Finally the third omission relates to information .
As regards the communication on blood , I have to say that since I have been a Member of this House , this is , I believe , the third time we have discussed this issue in the Chamber .
We have also put to the vote a number of amendments of mine intended in particular to bring into this report self @-@ sufficiency and the provision of blood which are of paramount importance for the blood safety .
Without prejudice to continual progress in self @-@ transfusion I think that the approximation of Member States &apos; rules is a very interesting step .
To introduce the card , as you propose , will require all medical facilities and offices in the Community - doctors , hospitals , health centres and the like - to install the necessary infrastructure in terms of hardware and software at a cost which is likely to be very considerable .
The Turin agenda is realistic yet ambitious .
Our people are frightened when they think of the future .
No strengthening of the Union &apos;s bodies , nor any deepening of cohesion .
And so I think that we in this House should take a look at the community spirit of applicant countries .
In our own countries we have allowed crime to overwhelm us .
That is why it is important for us to do our best to prepare them for accession .
Parliament &apos;s position on enlargement deserves something far better than a report of this kind .
You will recall the promise given to you by the Council during the last enlargement .
I wish to invite the rest to sign it as soon as possible .
The report should in other respects be viewed in the context of many MPs &apos; wish for a federal health policy , in which health costs are covered by the EU .
I have already had an opportunity - yesterday evening , in plenary - to express my support for the Commission communication and Mr Cabrol &apos;s report .
In any event , the National Front demands that the peoples of Europe should be directly consulted in a referendum to decide on the approval or rejection of Maastricht II .
On the other hand , a European Union with 20 or 25 countries requires and demands far @-@ reaching consideration as to the future Community budget , which means having at our disposal the bases and perspectives enabling us to respond effectively to needs arising from enlargement , without calling into question the legitimate aspirations of the peoples of the existing Member States , in particular in respect of the common agricultural policy , the structural funds and other Community policies .
It was not just because of the length of the trialogue meeting , but also because at that moment I was telephoned by the Ukrainian ambassador to Rome . I wanted to organize a ceremony with him next week in Rome , precisely in remembrance of the Chernobyl tragedy and , for the record , I was discussing with him how and where best to give this ceremony all the significance due to it .
Clearly our intervention in the Ukraine must proceed with caution so as not to deprive that country of 6 % of the energy it needs .
As for the budget allocated to civil safety in the nuclear sector , it was simply ridiculous .
I say to you today that one slow , lingering death of one child from radiation is one too many !
We have got a new word in our vocabulary now : the &apos; Belarus necklace &apos; , applicable to a generation of children have had their throats slit from ear to ear to deal with their thyroid cancer .
But the vision has not always coincided ; sometimes it has been complementary .
It is plunging the defenceless Lebanese people into all the horrors of war - dead and wounded civilians , the destruction of property , and mass exodus .
Rather , they will be eliminated by strictly complying with the commitments made to the Palestinian National Authority .
Some things are still in the pipeline so I cannot go into as much detail as I would like .
Question No 5 by Michl Ebner ( H @-@ 0233 / 96 )
It is a question of whether minutes are kept and whether those minutes are publicly accessible .
There will also be discussion of how cooperation can best be used to further more democratic and politically stable societies , where there is respect and legal security .
The conclusion of the summit should see an affirmation of objectives , namely the promotion of stability , well being and solidarity in the region , the presentation of an agenda for coordinated action for a stable , participative democracy , for economic cooperation , for integration and development and last but certainly not least for cooperation on environmental protection .
Then I would mention that Poland , Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , four Baltic countries which are not members of other European organizations , send observers to the WEU Parliamentary Assembly .
Is it your intention as Commissioner to develop a European policy to eliminate BSE throughout the Community ?
As for the reports in the media , it often happens , unfortunately , that a number of journalists simply copy from one another , and in the process two things are frequently entangled .
For a long time we were given the explanation that it was out of consideration for animals used in experiments . For example , when toxicological data is already available , and the use of further animals in experiments can be avoided .
In this context I would ask the Commissioner what the Commission is doing about this .
Mr President , I enjoyed working on the directive on unit pricing because the problem has been with us a long time and has already been the subject of a great deal of legislation ; but what has most frequently happened is that new legislation on the subject has been postponed because it was considered too complicated and the exercise was limited , perhaps necessarily so , to reaching compromises between the various Commission services , and indeed between the various organisations in our society .
They may seem trivialities , but this legislation has tremendous repercussions for innumerable shop keepers and consumers .
I do not just refer to the collapse of Barings Bank in London , following dealings on the Singapore market , but also to the consequences which followed lower interest rates in the United States in 1995 .
Their work depends on the real economy , not on speculation .
It will also help to improve the effectiveness of the Structural Funds , the Union &apos;s most important instrument of economic and social cohesion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioners , it is a matter of priority for the European Union to promote economic and social cohesion , in order to provide a guarantee for the leastdeveloped regions that in the transition to economic and monetary union , the inequalities do not increase .
Mr President , there is a risk associated with enlargement , concerning which we all of course agree in principle .
Madam President , unfortunately greed seems to be gaining ground in relations between the EU Member States and China .
One might be waiting for some very important messages sitting here in the Chamber .
Financing through the provision of capital will make it possible through Tacis to promote industrial cooperation between small and medium @-@ sized businesses in the EU and their counterparts in the NIS .
Various signals emerged from discussions with the Kazakh authorities .
Finally it is right to place great emphasis on development cooperation and sustainable economic development is of paramount importance .
The Commission is taking account of this constraint , and the amendments tabled by the Committee on Agriculture are mitigating its effects .
It is true that among G7 some economies achieve lower unemployment levels than others .
Practical measures are lacking , however , and platitudes remain ineffectual .
This seems to be quite an acceptable method of dealing with foodstuffs . Has that been explored with the British Government in terms of certificates of origin / veterinary certificates ?
Why has the Council still not operationally implemented the measures outlined in the Carcassonne plan for finding a solution to the Burundi crisis ?
So this report is about not only the provision of postal services but also the provision of social services .
I think we will take a good decision on this question in Parliament today , which I hope the Council will also accept .
So it is high time to promote the liberalization of the postal services in the European single market , for we need more competition in order to improve the efficiency of the postal services and also to make them more economical for the people and the economy .
I believe it is essential for the public service tasks of the postal administrations to be preserved , and for this they must be left the means to accomplish their mission .
The French Revolution did not abolish the privileges of the nobility in order to create new privileges for post office workers , at least not in my view .
Then , in that sense , the Observatory and the European Year will have a meaning and that is why we agree with the rapporteur &apos;s approach , more direct to distinguish the inner causes and instruments than to seek out the guilty .
In seeking to ban the work by Henri Roc , devoted to the many improbabilities of the SS Gerstein report , the Gayssot Act has made it more widely known .
These positive effects have been experienced in countries that have liberalized their postal markets .
That is also more or less the only tribute I can pay him .
It is quite possible to retain internal border controls , while at the same time giving third country citizens freedom to move around within the European Union if they have the right of residence in one of the EU Member States .
But this would have gone against the positions of the Member States whose definition was rejected and will also not have been a viable solution in financial terms .
Perhaps then , Mrs Baldi , we might have some follow @-@ up to the report on the right of intervention which was adopted here unanimously - with my name on it - because that report has been hanging around for three years already .
That means that the policy pursued in this area ought to begin with the reorganization of industrial society .
At a time when the European Union is adopting its programme of aid to the developing countries , it must take account of the need to reconcile economic growth and sustainable development , if the result is to be genuinely to improve the living conditions of the most disadvantaged population groups .
It seems to us that all of those amendments already form part of the common position .
And with regard to the training and education policy I have not heard anything about a proposal - which was in the white paper - about lifelong learning .
What we are trying to achieve is a situation where this internal market really functions as an integrated internal market , on the model of the American market , which operates as an internal market with a single currency .
I do apologize .
However , demographic growth there is unstoppable and , if it is not accompanied by job creation , the pressure of migration will continue to rise , with all the accompanying problems .
Mr President , in the seething cauldron of the Mediterranean , where Algeria is running with fire and blood , where Turkey is rent by internal warfare , where Israel and Palestine face the constant threat of latent violence , and where Libya is under the sway of a known terrorist government - in this region , a theatre of hostilities where death and injury are commonplace , Morocco , like it or not , is a relative haven of tranquillity , one of the few countries where an acceptable degree of collective security prevails .
Only recently we received information about that from the European Evangelical Alliance .
We shall follow developments closely and we ask the Council of Europe to keep us informed of its findings in the coming months .
As we entered Bosnia we saw a huge election poster for President Tudjman of Croatia .
But in that sphere too - we have just had the experience with Croatia -it is particularly necessary for PHARE democracy funds to be used to the best advantage .
So it is important that we concentrate on these and do not dissipate our energies .
So it will not surprise you that we as a Group have tabled a number of amendments to see whether we cannot point it here and there more in the direction of a better environment policy and that means for example that we think that with air transport , as has moreover been said by the Council of Environment Ministers and as was mentioned by the Commission in its report on excise duties that air transport must now finally be subject to indirect taxes , VAT and excise duties .
I should like to refer to various points made , but unfortunately we do not have the time .
In the European Union we have already had mutual recognition of driving licences for some time now .
And I believe that the effectiveness of the Union &apos;s research and technology policy demands the promotion of collaboration and coordination via integrated strategic diffusion of the results of research and technological development .
But the number of innovations successfully introduced on to the market is pitifully small .
This social concern , like environmental protection , education and health , prompted the choice of themes for the first task forces .
They were intended to make it possible to ensure good coordination and optimum complementarity between national and European activities .
In the Union alone there are today 340 tonnes of plutonium , which makes the resolution of this issue of the utmost importance .
DG XI itself has sent us today a very interesting bulletin , no 1 , in which it is clearly shown how many countries there are which have still not started to designate their special areas for conservation .
In taking that decision , the Commission was fulfilling its responsibility to take steps that will help to normalize the situation in the European Union .
Now I want to ask him if there are sufficient resources to guarantee this action .
Die Bild @-@ Zeitung reproduced an article from The Sun which gave its readers twenty ways to annoy the Germans , would you believe !
It is the fruit of a reckless statement to the House of Commons which had no scientific basis .
For example , questions about epidemiology and transmissibility .
We are also disappointed that once again the Council is allowing Parliament such a short time for giving its views .
For this reason we will vote against the report .
One decisive condition for stepping up cooperation with the last @-@ mentioned group of countries is however that cooperation should take place on the basis of the principle of reciprocity and with due consideration for the need to protect partners &apos; intellectual and industrial property rights .
According to the huissiers they were not members of the European Parliament &apos;s internal security forces nor could they have been , given what they were doing .
There should also be a concern to promote a model of sustainable development .
I could leave it at that , but honesty compels me to admit to Mr Macartney that the recommendation will not be supported by the entire Socialist Group .
The amendment by Mrs Myller and others can therefore be accepted .
In the future development of policy in the short sea shipping sector the Commission will take account of Parliament &apos;s recommendations and will keep it informed about progress that is made .
What approach does it intend to adopt at the forthcoming conference on climate change and the developing countries ?
We have fallen badly behind with our emergency aid for Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina .
A major weakness of the &apos; old &apos; EMS was that it was up to the Member States involved to initiate the process for adjusting exchange rates .
At this time , in the run @-@ up to the Florence European Council , the Commission feels it is important to restate our clear commitment to the approach we have adopted up to now in pursuing a stable and healthy macroeconomic policy which enables us to take determined and coordinated measures to combat unemployment , while at the same time keeping the preparations for the third phase of EMU on schedule .
There is no other policy available to us , and to tackle phenomena of a structural nature with measures that are appropriate for cyclical adjustment is mistaken because it would be damaging rather than beneficial .
Mr President , the report by Mr von Wogau is extremely useful .
Is the Lord good ?
We all know that nuclear fission is an inherently dangerous process , as indeed is a fission in our economies .
What is worse , if we followed today &apos;s recommendations to the letter , our already stagnating growth would be slowed still further .
There is no doubt that the euro will enter circulation on 1 January 1999 .
We must now take all these factors into account , with a view to making short sea shipping a mode of transport which is environmentally friendly and safe .
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the convergence criteria for monetary union are a vehicle for the destruction of welfare standards in the Member States .
Mr President , I regard the fact that a substantial debate is taking place this afternoon on the subject of fisheries as a sign of the importance of Europe &apos;s future fisheries policy .
We are told , rightly or wrongly , that there is overcapacity in the fishing industry , that fish stocks are becoming dramatically scarce , that juveniles are inadequately protected , that the level of marine pollution is alarming , and that the use of certain fishing devices and practices is wrong .
Neither the Commission , nor the Member States , nor the government of my country .
That is the major issue we must face .
At any rate , I believe that the contribution of this debate is very valuable , particularly with a view to the report that is to be considered by the Council .
It is therefore possible to achieve this goal , even under MGP IV .
Subject : Termination of the EU &apos;s Helios programme
As a result sanctions may be introduced against Italy .
Does it intend to endeavour to change this state of affairs and , if so , how ?
On 12 December 1995 the Official Journal published the guidelines on aid to employment .
EU and national health programmes are aimed at reducing smoking as a way of combating cancer and other diseases .
I just have a brief supplementary question . The health of consumers really should be our overriding concern , and with regard to final products we now know , for example , that gelatine is contained in cake glazes and in jelly @-@ babies , which are so popular with children .
The general directive from 1988 on the acknowledgement of qualifications with respect to this sector has proved poor and inadequate , since most Member States of the EU have chosen an alternative permitted by the directive involving the introduction of a compulsory aptitude test for professional practice , which in reality has hindered the free practice of the profession of lawyer .
In the case of the former , the reference is to mobile terminals whose main purpose is planet @-@ roaming , the possibility then of travelling all around the world with just one telephone terminal .
We must be sure that we get the 314 votes we need tomorrow , but they must be votes based on the facts of the issue , not used as a negotiating tactic , which is the approach the Council seems to be taking . And I would bet a good European motorbike that we win , Commissioner , then we can both ride on it .
Amendments Nos 8 to 11 are intended to delete various provisions relating to anti @-@ tampering measures .
Perhaps the working party will eventually come up with an answer to that question .
Finally , if I lived in northern Canada in the cold and wind that exists there - and I lived in Canada for well over a year in the 1960s - I would wear a fur coat .
I believe it is the first report of its kind to look at the local impact on the economy of the BSE crisis .
The Confidence Pact is not something that can be achieved overnight .
The European Council will essentially be called on to discuss the outstanding issues of extradition and EUROPOL .
This Friday and Saturday in Florence our fifteen prime ministers have a job to do .
There will certainly be interests , outside Europe too , seeking to impede the achievement of this union , but we are ready to fight for it in the knowledge that despite different cultural and political origins there are people in this Parliament who stand by political union , because they know that is where the future lies , and the alternative is war between poor people .
Lastly , I wish to express my clear support for the stance of the President @-@ in @-@ Office .
In that event we should seriously consider having the other fourteen summit members simply take decisions without the United Kingdom .
I support the present motion for a resolution .
The strategy developed by the Commission for the European Council in Florence is embraced by the overall strategy that I had the privilege of presenting to you myself , here , when the present Commission was appointed .
&apos;Intérêt public &apos; would mean that the State could make use in some way of a potestative clause to release itself quite unilaterally from the obligations of the Directive .
The cooperation of the motorcycling organizations should in our opinion be a central element in making two @-@ wheeled motor vehicles , which from the social point of view are an essential means of transport , ecologically defensible and harmless to health as well .
Of these , 22 countries have introduced the prohibition in the last five years .
This amounts to tossing a coin over the question of the single currency coming into force .
We must put an end to what is perceived by the world as European powerlessness .
And what about the ECU 92 million of emergency relief that Parliament made available under separate budget headings ?
I just wish to say that on numerous occasions there has been no shortage of hypocrisy in the European Union , and no shortage of it here , too , in the European Parliament .
We know that the conflict in Yugoslavia just as in Rwanda and Burundi , for example , is very largely the result of misuse and manipulation of the media .
This is the time to say to ourselves that , after the departure of the American troops , we shall still be needed for a long time .
The Council &apos;s consideration of the amendment of the TACIS programme has been inexcusably slow .
Is this one of a number of problems which have led to the postponement of the action until next year ?
We hope the way forward to solving the BSE problem will be determined in the next few hours , ending the current state of paralysis and deadlock and allowing the United Kingdom to replace non @-@ cooperation with a more flexible attitude . If this does not happen , we believe that Florence , only forty @-@ eight hours away , and with all the Heads of State and of Government present , will provide an authoritative political setting for examining the problem and deciding on any subsequent steps .
We are all well aware of Twentieth Century history : the problems of the Albanians and Kosovo have repeatedly sparked conflict and tension .
But we must point out , as we have already said in other cases , that it is up to the Commission to present proposals to us on the subject and so far the Commission has not submitted any proposal to the Council designed to extend the deadlines or widen the existing measures to other products not already governed by the existing rules .
It should also be pointed out that Finland joined the Schengen Agreement rather passively , in fact without any extensive public debate , and as far as I know even the Finnish parliament has had its doubts as to whether Finland even needs an arrangement like the present Schengen Agreement .
The chair of the business leaders group was invited to give an account of this agenda at the Visby summit .
This can of course , as has already been pointed out , serve as a good example of how free movement can operate at its best .
This is a neighbouring area , closely linked to us throughout our history , where the lack of resources and demographic growth are now triggering extremely tricky problems .
I cannot however recommend to my group the acceptance of Amendments Nos 1 @-@ 8 , whereas I warmly support Mr Mather &apos;s proposal to provide more information for employees , especially those working in small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in particular , on the dangers caused by explosions .
Madam President , cancer is a serious disease among the population .
This time limit is mentioned in the statute .
Madam President , Mr Ombudsman , Madam Rapporteur , as the Treaty states , the Ombudsman &apos;s annual report is made to Parliament .
This decision was in line with the spirit of the Treaties .
Of course it is a threat if a sect such as the Aum @-@ Shinriko sect in Japan , for instance , with its apocalyptic fantasies , procures materials which could poison the groundwater of a town of more than a million inhabitants or which could pose a huge threat by dispersion in the air or by fire .
In my view , furthermore , there is no precise list detailing the problem .
We are dealing here purely with problems in the former USSR , with problems which have indeed taken on dramatic dimensions .
It is therefore impossible to vote for this resolution since far too many questions remain unanswered as far as Sweden is concerned .
The self @-@ delusion of some people who maintain that it is a case of good pro @-@ Westerners on the one side and supporters of the former regime on the other - that , too , is reprehensible , given that the roles of everyone , now and before , are known fact .
But in most constituencies the electoral process was orderly .
Some of our colleagues seem to be a bit tired of this issue .
And only urgent intervention by us to secure a secret vote made it possible ultimately for that critical resolution to be passed by a large majority .
In other words , instead of those medicines going directly to those who need them , to their doctors and their hospitals , they are at present being diverted through other channels , and the bottom line is that we no longer know if they will ever reach the children .
What did she mean by that , Mr President ?
The joint debate is closed .
Openness is one of democracy &apos;s cornerstones , and Mr Söderman has sent an inquiry to Union bodies regarding the way in which documents are made available to citizens .
It too calls for the directive to be amended and to include in its scope a wider range of criminal activities .
At first , in 1991 , that was not the case , as we know .
In this connection , the arrival of new translation and interpretation techniques can help the so @-@ called minority languages to flourish .
Mr President , I support the Commission &apos;s three @-@ year programme to promote linguistic diversity in the information society through the encouragement of new technologies and the development of multilingual services .
Nevertheless , the European Parliament and the Commission are following the same direction , although Parliament , as is only its right , is looking ahead a little further and more quickly .
That is why the Committee on Cooperation and Development proposed that it should be approved .
We fully agree with the Commission proposal to maintain the use of one , two or three varieties .
As far as crémant is concerned , I will not dwell on matters that have already been covered .
This does not arise in ornamental horticulture and would not have to be encouraged .
But this self @-@ determination is only possible for the smaller nations of Central Europe if fragmented artificial states are replaced by a new , large entity that links the nations together , namely if the European Union is enlarged to the east .
But it must be taken into account that in the medium term this quota will have to be revised upwards .
Mr President , as my final point , I would like to mention a few decisions taken by the 7 together with Russia regarding the process of peace and reconstruction in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina .
Thirdly , with whom did you actually arrange your appearance , or did you want to make your independent contribution to the democratic deficit of the G7 , which is of course well known ?
We cannot artificially make the prosperous countries more prosperous .
The work of the intergovernmental conference received a fresh stimulus .
Action in the Middle East peace process has been another area of priority commitment .
The Intergovernmental Conference has not only been called , it has started on its journey with the aid of the reflection group &apos;s very important work , which President Prodi and President Dini have referred to here .
The proper response would have been to abandon immediately the coordinated irresponsibility of an industrial and political system that drives animals mad !
A crisis which could have had devastating consequences for Europe has been ended .
We must succeed in making progress in the political handling of the issues of European integration .
I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the President of the Commission , Mr Santer , for his statement here today which is most welcome because of its optimism , its encouragement and which gives a clear demonstration of his determination .
Rarely have we followed a European Council meeting with such interest as we did the Florence Summit .
Despite the initial doubts we had due to the domestic political situation , there were some significant achievements , including the end to the BSE crisis , the association agreement with Slovenia , the two Bosnian conferences to reinforce the Dayton accord and of course the start of the IGC .
I am sure the Commission knows but does the Council ?
Improving the state of the environment should be one of the most important objectives in achieving binding international co @-@ operation .
These serious , cross @-@ border problems which we are encountering today cannot be resolved at a national level alone .
Legislative and administrative simplification
This is as true for food policy as it is for environment policy .
So I should like to see a joint action programme by the Commission and the Member States to achieve an improvement in the quality of transposition at national level .
It is essential that in the IGC discussions there are movements towards giving us a Treaty competence for renewable energy alongside that which we have , somewhat anachronistically , for nuclear power through the Euratom Treaty .
The objective must be to raise the share of renewable energy sources in primary energy consumption from the present 5.2 % to 15 % by the year 2010 , and I believe that this ambitious aim can be a realistic one .
The Committee on the Environment is convinced that the question is not merely one of demographic population growth and increasing poverty but also of effective environmental responses .
In the resolution of 11 March 1994 , and later in the resolutions regarding Cairo and International Family Year we in this Parliament voted for genuine liberty , freedom of choice , for women in matters of family planning .
Perhaps it is the responsibility of the national and international committees to open discussions with those countries , to try and understand them , and to teach them the Olympic spirit of freedom and democracy .
The amount available is ECU 30 , 000 multiplied by the number of jobs to be created . There is a very practical step .
The Euro Info Centres , the Business Cooperation Networks , the Business Cooperation Centres and so on .
It goes without saying that there must be clarity with regard to the relationship between the future EASDAQ and the existing national and regional exchanges in connection with undesirable overlapping and competition .
He puts it plainly when he says that when these companies who are in debt to him pay their salaries they are doing so with his money .
Mr President , I would like to express a few thoughts on the views put forward in Mrs Ewing &apos;s report .
I particularly welcome the proposal for a statutory right to interest on late payments .
We also agree with the finding that the improvement of knowledge about the quality aspects and the satisfaction of customers are important aspects of the information and cooperation services .
That is what is present in and absent from the summit &apos; conclusions &apos; and the resolution says nothing about this .
The Cairo conference reaffirmed the essential status of women in the quest for sustainable human development .
My group feels it is vital that we should vote on the Ford and Nordmann reports this week , and we support the Christian Democrats &apos; proposal on the subject .
Far too often many of the installations which this directive is designed to safeguard , operate quietly and unobtrusively without people realizing the great dangers that they pose .
It was noticeable that the Commission initially refused to support some of the amendments which the Council accepted , but in any event the common position now before us is a considerable improvement on what we had before .
We also need to ensure that , whatever measures are put in place , our businesses will be left as competitive as possible , both domestically and in terms of overseas competition .
The other amendments essentially concern the Italian version of Article 2 ( 2 ) and ( 5 ) of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1601 / 91 , synonyms being added for some descriptions and indications .
The airports are not happy with the common position .
Mr President , the Council &apos;s common position is , in our opinion , far from ideal , but we do not think this is sufficient reason to reject it , as Mr Seal has recommended on behalf of the majority in the Committee on Transport .
I will be urging Members to vote against the Council &apos;s common position and I hope that we succeed in getting the required number of votes .
Madam President , I have a question concerning yesterday &apos;s order of business which was approved when the agenda was finally adopted .
It is simply a right to travel .
The free movement of persons contributes to the meeting of cultures and the development of democracy .
But now things really have gone too far , and this proposal from the Council for a joint action on the right to travel of nationals of non @-@ member countries who are lawfully residing in a Member State , under Article K.3 , the third pillar , is an extremely provocative one both for the Commission and for this House .
This attitude was born , in certain countries , of the triumphant economic liberalism of the 1980s .
As Mr Fayot said , we wish to contribute to ensuring that the market is made subject to the laws of democracy and the need to protect public health .
Moreover , Parliament itself states in the resolution which I have just mentioned that it considers that there is a need to continue manufacturing medical products for human and animal use from the brain and spinal cord of cattle .
Operators of high @-@ risk installations must be obliged to provide their employees with the information , training and equipment that they need in order to respond adequately to the special demands of their work in normal and abnormal conditions .
This , at least , is what the minister indicated that it would do at today &apos;s meeting of the committee .
Because of this , the realization of the trans @-@ European networks will meet with further delays , and the Commission &apos;s desired effect of job creation through the construction and rapid completion of the TENs is seriously called into question .
It goes without saying that the enormous political and public relations cost of such a delay would be borne by Parliament , since our citizens would not understand why , having repeatedly stressed the need to build this network and insisted that it would lead to the creation of countless jobs , this House should now decide to reject the agreement reached or , in other words , to perpetuate the infrastructure deficiency , which in some Member States is very great , thereby delaying the creation of jobs .
I would point out in this respect that Austria has only been a Member of the European Union since 1 January 1995 , but that its legitimate demands must be taken seriously .
The President of the House this morning sent his condolences to the families of the victims who were killed or injured when a military aircraft crashed at Eindhoven airport .
I should like to thank him for his work .
The misunderstandings have now been cleared up , and the June text was adopted almost unanimously by the Steering Committee consisting of experts from all the Member States of the Council of Europe and representing all shades of opinion .
We are in the process of taking people &apos;s views for this updating and , when we have heard them and considered them , will come to a conclusion and announce it .
Equality has long been a priority issue in the EU .
Scotland and Wales should not be dragging behind because in certain areas of England there have been problems between the UK Government and the Commission .
I believe in fact that the administrative costs could amount to a large percentage of the support received by Sweden .
Subject : Specific support and advice for human resources projects for women in disadvantaged regions
The Council of Europe &apos;s conventions acquire the force of law when the States have ratified them .
The preservation of health and the reduction of suffering are high ethical values which form worthy objectives .
Things will be open and public .
This is unacceptable and incompatible with our independence as parliamentarians .
Mr President , I did not wish to speak as rapporteur , I was replacing Mr Wijsenbeek , but that was indeed rather ambitious . I think I have three minutes in which to say that the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party approves the two reports whose preparation it has been closely involved with .
So what we need to do is to carry on with the positive side of the ECSC while at the same time making it more open and less privileged .
We have not begun an inquisition there , but we have to do what the law requires .
Harmonization eliminates restrictions , and that is what this directive is designed to achieve .
We strongly urge all the democratic forces , the two governments and community leaders , to redouble their efforts and give a new signal of hope for the peace process through the all @-@ party talks .
We refuse to consider employment as a rare commodity on the market of which we are difficult consumers .
We do realize that this will probably not be achieved at the present Intergovernmental Conference , because a number of Member States that do not belong to the WEU are unlikely to accept Article 5 , in other words the mutual assistance clause .
Surely we should not be faced with that within the borders of the European Union .
We do not want these glorious resolutions passed at the end of summit meetings .
Following the example of the Canadian Government which reacted strongly and proposes among other things to refer the US to the conciliation machinery of NAFTA . We should do the same with the World Trade Organization .
This issue could be very appropriately discussed when the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council , Minister Owen , meets the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs in September .
The peace agreement on Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina , concluded last December , was a culmination of a sustained commitment by the international community , to which the European Union contributed substantially .
If this House is not sovereign in fixing its own agenda , what is it sovereign in ?
My second point is along the same lines , but in this case I refer to the high @-@ speed rail link .
Why adopt a complicated approach when we can adopt a simple one , easy to understand and clearly stated . I shall therefore be voting for the absolute prohibition of any gift .
It still has a second step to take , that of the Philippe de Villiers group , which tabled the motion of censure .
Mr President , firstly I would like to convey a very warm and hearty welcome to the Irish Minister for European Affairs on this , his first visit to a plenary session of the European Parliament .
For that reason we also regret the minimal progress that has been made in developing our common foreign and security policy , especially in the sphere of defence policy .
The fact that Mr Holbrook has been back on duty since yesterday should really give us something to think about .
I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on bringing forward a very fine report .
Firstly , because certain structural measures require not only legislative procedures but also require consultation with , and the participation of , the social partners .
I should like to hear whether the Council is considering any initiatives to this end .
Today most of the instruments which affect employment prospects for their citizens are still in the hands of the Member States - rates of wages and social welfare , the length of hours worked and infrastructure within the individual states .
Mr President , very briefly , while adding my own best wishes to those already expressed in this House for the success of the Irish presidency , I would like to make three quick points to provide a degree of reassurance , and perhaps dispel a degree of misunderstanding , regarding unemployment and economic and monetary union , the stability pact and the present state of the economy .
The intention from the outset was that the convention should lay down clear rules on jurisdiction and the procedures for the execution of decisions in respect of marital disputes involving more than one Member State .
Now this is no longer the case , at least at airports such as Zurich .
The wool sector provides the potential to generate good employment in rural areas , provided we have proper structures in place .
I should just like to follow up by expressing a couple of concerns .
Sadly , however , the answer that he has given me on this matter obliges me to express pity for him , because all he has done is repeat the fairy tales that we have been fed for the last 15 years .
This constitutes a major challenge which will have to be addressed with the greatest determination .
That we , as adults , make a mess of things is our problem . But we must not make the children suffer and we must limit the damage as far as possible .
It is an important and sensitive issue and it is one on which the Council is taking action , as I said earlier in the debate .
And yet that politician , who at the time stated so emphatically that she wanted to halt this fundamentalist upsurge , has now formed an alliance with that party , which in spite of everything was successful in the elections .
Mr President , you seem to be trying to tell me that my time is up .
Next year is a crucial year for all the fifteen nations that constitute the European Union .
In fact , the preliminary draft budget already provides for a reserve .
There are about 0.7 million producers in the Union and the cost of the regime is about ECU 1.8 billion , which comes to about ECU 200 per month , per individual producer .
Mr President , I believe this Parliament is at grave risk if , to protect the interests of a party - in this case , not a political party , but a Member of the House who has taken a specific position on a certain issue - moves are made to bend one of the fundamental principles of the way in which this Parliament functions .
.
The conclusion that an improvement in financial management is needed is to be welcomed .
It is a matter of which countries should be given the right and the opportunity to submit tenders and obtain contracts as part of the current aid programme .
We had agreed with the Commission that further posts should be filled in DG VIII and that the money for these posts , on which we cannot take a decision , should be used by the Commission for DG VIII , so that NGO projects , which at present cannot be implemented because of lack of staff , can go ahead .
The rejection of this report by Parliament is shameful .
From this point of view the report also contradicts Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen &apos;s report on which we voted when we discussed the Intergovernmental Conference .
The French herd has fallen from 30 million head of sheep to 8 million head .
The vote will take place at 5.30 p.m .
All economic links based on trade , tourism and investment by European organizations operating in Burma must be broken off .
Mr President , what is needed in Cyprus today , is peaceful coexistence of the two communities , the Greek and Turkish communities .
My own party in Ireland has pioneered such legislation .
As regards the particular case of Father Shay Cullen , the Commission is in a position to state that he was actually arrested on 13 June last but was quickly released .
This aggressive action did , however , lead to a build @-@ up of arms in the region , according to reliable sources .
The joint debate is closed .
A notable omission for us is the position of Vojvodina which is not actually mentioned in the report .
But I agree with all the others , especially No 4 , tabled by Mr Santini , which is important if we are to get information across to the citizens .
The committee is much more open than it used to be .
In return , Europe will have access to Israel &apos;s research and research programme .
Israel also points the way in the production of educational software .
I turn briefly to a specific problem we have in Ireland with the administration of the set @-@ aside regulation .
And anybody who has made mistakes will make more !
So far , we have been told that , in accordance with a temporary rule that was in force until 30 June of this year , two rates have applied : a monthly customs rate , on the basis of which annual rates have been applied , and the annual rates themselves , which certainly do not reflect the constant exchange @-@ rate fluctuations .
It supports difficult areas both in the south and north of the Community .
The Commission has examined the orders of the agreement to determine which of them required adaptation and it concluded that the orders of the agreement with Andorra could essentially be implemented as they stood for the three new Member States as well .
The reason why we have taken such strong exception is that we believe that both the Helms @-@ Burton law and the D &apos;Amato law are contrary to international law , misguided in principle and counterproductive in practice .
Surely there are interesting parallels !
I therefore welcome the opportunity , on behalf of my colleague Mrs Gradin , to make a statement to you today .
Europol must be able to take active steps to hunt down the criminal networks through the use of specialized information and experience on organized crime , and specifically organized crime as it affects children .
I do not think that it is enough to combat child pornography : it is necessary to combat pornography in general , also in order to protect children , and , as has in fact been emphasized , the responsibility for this lies with all adults , in the hedonistic climate which now prevails , where pleasure and money are the ultimate criteria of value and behaviour .
We are concerned not only with government , but with the consumer as well .
The crisis of confidence which is eroding the unity of Europe and jeopardizing the future of the Union has much to do with the impression people have of dealing with an inhuman machine concerned only with economic and financial profitability , and abandoning people to their fate .
This incorporation must go hand in hand with a public service charter defining the organizational and financial arrangements and enabling the public service to become a tool of the European Union &apos;s industrial policy , competitiveness and regional planning .
Annual report on the structural funds 1994
But although that is one criterion of the regulation , the Commission did not examine , either in the programmes or in their implementation , whether the sustained development that the structural funds are to promote in these regions also takes account of the need to protect natural resources .
I understand your criticism about our tardiness , but I also regret the fact that we were not able to discuss what happened in 1994 until September 1996 in Parliament .
Portugal converged , unemployment was reabsorbed and there was a period of convergence .
They have even made investments showing that , at the end of the day , some of these peripheral economies were much more dynamic and far more able to develop than they seemed .
Allowing for a system of this kind will require the preparation of follow @-@ up reports by independent experts , which incidentally do not appear in the annual report .
But when is the definitive system going to happen ?
This applies to Amendments Nos 3 , 4 and 7 . Whether we can vote for the report as a whole will depend crucially on the outcome of these votes .
That is why we opposed Amendment No 16 tabled by the Committee on Transport and Tourism . We believe that the Commission text is far stronger and encompasses all the vessels and therefore nobody escapes .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , unemployment is still a crucial problem in the European Union .
And this contradiction is unresolved .
It is possible that the first decision was made before any of these notices were given that the system was in chaos .
Mr President , I say to Mr Tomlinson that I am really sorry but I cannot agree with him .
Clarity of thought is essential to effective government action .
The group chairmen were agreed , however , that in the special circumstances which we have this week , Question Time could not be held for reasons of time .
We cannot allow the concept of human rights to be expanded indefinitely .
Unfortunately , the report we are debating here today has a grave historical tradition behind it , since as long ago as 1793 , Robespierre had a particularly demagogic declaration on human rights approved by the Convention , and accompanied it with a brand of state terrorism known as the Terror .
I am confident that tomorrow , without further delay , we shall prove capable of adopting the resolution contained in Mrs De Esteban &apos;s report , and that consequently we shall display sufficient political courage and consistency to engage in open self @-@ criticism which leads our respective Member States to take the necessary measures to eliminate these violations of human rights .
Mr President , we have had considerable difficulties over the last couple of years with these reports on human rights because of differences of view as to what constitutes human rights and other similar problems .
Mr President , it is a question of taking a final decision on what we considered in February in Parliament , when we delivered our opinion on a package of measures for inland waterway transport .
What are known as flags of convenience in the maritime sector are now spreading to the aviation sector .
Madam President , the future of the global information society is as fascinating as it is disturbing .
Although there are obviously positive and new opportunities which must be welcomed and exploited , there are dangers for those who may become second @-@ class citizens of the information society .
Nana Mouskouri , the rapporteur for the Committee on Culture for this report , emphasizes the role of libraries and cultural and educational establishments , the importance of informing and raising the awareness of small independent producers on questions of copyright , refers to the desirable interdepartmental cooperation at the Commission so that all discussions can be carefully linked on aspects of content and technology , and insists on the urgent need to rationalize all of this work through the collective question of rights .
This is something different from the line of &apos; we must join in &apos; , as has been pointed out here this morning .
In my opinion , it will not help us to make progress in future discussions if we launch an attack on private broadcasting in this report at European level .
Mr President , the debate and vote on this issue in committee made it clear that , in general terms , public service television plays - and , I believe , must continue to play - an important role in almost all the Member States of the European Union .
This is important for the advent , at long last , of a genuine citizens &apos; Europe .
Finally , I should like to explain in particular why we voted against paragraph 93 , since this is something that is only too likely to be labelled as a victory for the far right .
Equal treatment in social security
I very much hope that , by adopting this report , we shall move one step closer to real and tangible equality of opportunities .
I noticed that there were quite a few of our arguments which Mr Flynn did not discuss , nor does he appear to see any reason for adopting any of the amendments which the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights worked so long and hard to produce .
The annual wage costs of a passenger vessel vary considerably , depending on whether it is a French or British vessel .
In my view , workers within and outside the EU must at last be placed on an equal footing .
Is that going to damage our competitiveness ?
I therefore think that &apos; adjustment &apos; or &apos; flexibility &apos; should not come to mean that social or labour law rules are invalidated .
First of all , Europe with all its diversity has an equal need for a reduction and a flexible reorganization of working time , in order to cater for sectoral needs and business circumstances , taking particular account of the specific features of SMEs .
Mr President , I am of course grateful to the Commissioner for his extremely precise reply concerning the Rothley and Alber reports .
It is wrong to see this as a meaningless declaration . In fact , it indicates that other forms of aid continue to be possible outside the OECD agreement : aid for research and development , for example , and regional aid .
Of course , after the expiry of the patents on these new medicinal products , we also need the generic products ; this means that we need the industry which takes up the new discovery and then offers its own similar products , perhaps at a lower cost , which is important to the consumer because these medicines are normally cheaper .
According to the information available to the Commission , the study did not appear in scientific journals , nor was it submitted to other scientists for checking .
Given the progress being made on convergence , the Commission is convinced - as I said a moment ago - that a significant number of countries will be ready to participate in EMU from the outset .
Surely the consumer will be the loser in this game with several different kinds of eco @-@ label ?
Madam President , one way of attacking unemployment is undoubtedly by reducing working time for those who are in work .
This prevented several thousand lay @-@ offs .
I know how personally involved in this you are ; you have spoken to me many times .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
As Mr Pimenta said , there is a long history behind it .
And I think it is all the worse for the fact that the EU is one of the biggest importers and a real consumer market .
You will gather from my speech here today that I am concerned as to what will happen if we do not have a proposal adopted .
Over the last few years , Spain has suffered frequently - perhaps too frequently - from such problems in the export of its fruit and vegetables , as well as other more sensitive products such as dietary products for children .
Item I - Situation in Cyprus :
There are distributional consequences no matter what way one looks at this problem .
In our debate last year we looked forward to the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference .
Nowhere is the amendment of the Treaty more necessary than here .
Mr President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , President Santer , ladies and gentlemen , the proceedings of the Intergovernmental Conference - of which , incidentally , two thirds of Europeans have never heard - are clearly displaying deep @-@ seated differences about the objectives of European integration and the ways of achieving it .
If EMU is attained too quickly , we shall certainly be confronted with these problems , and it will cost us dear .
I want to highlight a fact that I consider essential at this time : the basic point the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council made was that economic and monetary union and the single currency are irreversible , and the decision has already been taken .
We can not live without one another .
We have conducted protracted discussions about this report in the Committee on Women &amp; # x02BC ; s Rights which concern pensions for women , and during these debates we have always carefully ensured that the Commission was present .
Breyer report
Let me remind you that in 1880 people in Europe worked for 3200 hours a year - today , they work half as long !
That is a feature we would hope to continue with .
The priorities of the draft budget are not the priorities of the Commission .
Mr Brinkhorst raised two rather detailed questions .
In any event , Mr President , the Council should feel highly flattered at Parliament &apos;s great confidence in it .
We must make early progress with the &apos; food and medicine for oil &apos; campaign .
The Council , accordingly , is actively engaged in the international effort to find a comprehensive political solution in the framework of the United Nations .
Turkey intends to play the part of a regional superpower , aspiring to greater freedom to shape its own destiny .
I did not believe that Turkey would change overnight because we had a customs union .
This is not just a question of putting Turkey on trial .
I too have been in the government palace .
The Council &apos;s strategy is not - as has been described - business as usual .
Even so , combatting these appalling activities is , sadly , not so easy .
But specialists point out to us that this is a particularly questionable affair . That is why the setting up and supporting of reporting points is such an obvious measure .
Mr President , I want to welcome the cross @-@ party support for this debate , initiated by our group and spearheaded by Mrs Todini , on the complex and disturbing issue of violence against children .
There is rarely an occasion when the three institutions - the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council of Ministers - agree on the seriousness of a problem .
The Commission will take serious note of the positions expressed by the European Parliament , and what I can promise is that the Commission will so far as possible keep the chairman and rapporteur of the Committee on Budgets informed about related developments , within the framework of flexibility and trust that inspires relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission .
Personally , I opposed this .
As regards mineral oils , the Committee on Agriculture has unanimously adopted the following text , and I quote : &apos; In view of the ecological benefits and the use of agricultural land for the manufacture of biofuels , calls on the Commission to study a system of taxation that would encourage the use of biofuels . &apos; 
However , I do consider it essential that we continue to see the connection , Mr President , which is why I call for the same as the previous speaker .
It is exceptionally important that the third multiannual programme is set up as a part of the pact for jobs .
This programme specifically offers opportunities that we shall not be neglecting because the European economy needs greater substance and we need to be closer to businessmen .
It can lead to higher prices , a lower level of service and a less varied supply .
So I would like to thank the Members of the House , because this has been very much a cross @-@ party initiative in this House , and Commissioner Bangemann for his political support at a very difficult time when we felt it was going to be rather hard to get the Commission and Council to accept the approach that we were taking .
This is just one example - there will be many more - of sound practice which can enhance the day @-@ to @-@ day lives of all of us .
The citizens also expect us to recover the misappropriated funds .
Fresh attention began to be paid to the problem when the Council signed , on 25 July 1995 , the Convention on the Protection of the European Communities &apos; Financial Interests against the background of the third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty .
Those who receive money from the Community budget must also allow the appropriate checks to be carried out .
But , as far as the European Parliament is concerned , wasn &apos;t there something in this House as well ?
In Srpska , which has been ethnically cleansed , there was politics of a different sort .
I wish , however , to underline that they are certainly not the permanent solution to the problems that persist in the region and that the unity of Bosnia and its inter @-@ ethnic character are certainly not guaranteed by the elections .
There can be no argument - Rule 124 is very clear .
The concept of public service must not be limited to culture , sport , recreation , health and education but should also include science , the environment , technical innovation , all areas of economic activity of interest to the population ; it should also target the whole public however far away they live , even those living abroad .
We must insist that the Turkish Government ensures that those responsible for these acts of violence are arrested and tried .
The military coup carried out by Buyoya and condemned by all governments took place unbelievably at the very time that the OAU , with the backing and logistical and financial support of the European Union and the UN , had decided to intervene in an effort to resolve this tragic situation .
That is why I ask this House to endorse the requests made by the Green Group and the ARE Group under the Notenboom procedure , in the same way as in the future 1997 budget , in relation to the appropriations to be allocated for the activities of the International Court of Justice for former Yugoslavia .
What we have here is political persecution by the Russian authorities of a former officer who has done his duty as a Russian citizen and as a European citizen without revealing any military secrets whatsoever in doing so .
That is also why we think of Colombia as a priority country under the rubric of democratisation and human rights in Latin America .
To take a campaign which I myself conducted , the abortion campaign , the Belgian law has been unchanged for many years .
Similarly , we have criticized the Council &apos;s constantly referral to texts which are not legally binding .
I would ask you , fellow Members of this House , is there any sense in our financing the preservation of the Pilgrim &apos;s Way while at the same time consenting to such brutal destruction ?
Road accidents , accidents at work , the abuse of women and children - these are all among the common consequences of drinking alcohol and are often caused by people who regard themselves as moderate drinkers .
I would like , first of all to thank Parliament for its initiative in producing a report on East @-@ West cooperation activities in the field of energy and nuclear safety , and especially Mr Adam , who has drafted a most valuable contribution .
In this context , the list of EU financial contributions - divided up into national categories - represents a step backwards .
One thinks of measures against drugs trafficking and illegal trading in dangerous substances , and effective action can also be taken jointly with the Baltic region against trafficking in human beings and child pornography .
Madam President , perhaps we should find a different form of words and hold that vote again , since the result is fraudulent .
It is the business of a parliament to ensure the resources are made available .
In relation to Parliament too - I venture to say - the decision to divide up urgency in the same way as a rotten apple is cut in two , offering us the good half , that is spending , actually increasing it as stated in the Funk report , and returning the bad half to the sender , that is revenue involving cuts for cereal farmers , does not seem to me a particularly edifying prospect .
Really , you are just perverse .
Urgency could have been requested in a completely different way from that used by the Council and , above all , in the light of last night &apos;s decisions , I believe that there will be substantial amendments to this proposal when discussed by the Council .
So we will continue with the agenda as originally arranged .
The debate is closed .
The debate is closed .
Is all that paperwork really the most effective method of scrutiny ?
We have noted that the employment problem is not dealt with in the OECD agreement , nor is it adequately covered by any of the international bodies .
The request has been made by a group , and so we can vote on it .
Madam President , anything goes , including wringing a text out of a handful of Members .
Mr Cornelissen , if I know you , you surely do not wish to raise a point of order , and I cannot give you the floor for any other reason !
It cannot , as Ms Tongue has said , be viewed in the same way as perhaps more clearly defined economic proposals are .
With these criteria , I consider the Community can and should offer practical and positive support to this important European industry .
The European Parliament is therefore right to table amendments to strengthen the ARIANE programme , and amendments tending to establish more flexible procedures by opting for a purely advisory committee .
The debate is closed .
We cannot work out ambitious cultural programmes which are very well @-@ drafted and written clearly , interesting because of their ambitions and objectives , as is the case of the Kaleidoscope , Ariane and Raphael Programmes , and not grant them the resources to match their ambition .
A system of mutual recognition could cause great legal insecurity ; it might be appropriate to advocate a system of prior or deferred examination , but immediately following registration , thereby reconciling the requirements of speed in granting the right with legal security and the safeguarding of those most affected by the granting of models .
I shall come back to that later , but firstly I should like to present in greater detail our work programme for next year .
As we have seen again quite recently , this is the situation in a number of our countries .
I note that , in the programme &apos;s conclusion , the Commission has mapped out the route to the year 2000 and beyond .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in its work programme for 1997 , the Commission restates its apt and ambitious general objectives . It must be said , however , that the means proposed for achieving those objectives are not commensurate with what is at stake .
With regard to taxation , you could take advantage of the Intergovernmental Conference to propose to the Member States the establishment of a statutory upper limit to tax and social security contributions .
Although , of course , the European budget is very small indeed compared to the national budgets , there is a symbolic value in Europe not being seen as a spender at a time when the national parliaments and the national governments are trying to be parsimonious .
As for the Court of Auditors , the discussions going on with this institution since the creation of a draft budget by the Council has shown that there is a deficit of auditors due to the larger scope of controls carried out by this institution as a consequence of the Union &apos;s enlargement .
Hence it is important that we do not regard culture budget lines as soft targets for budget cuts but rather essential elements for economic prosperity .
Through our participation in these actions , we demonstrate the political strength and cohesion of the European Union and its identification with , and interest in helping , those in difficulties .
We have voted against the report from Julio Anoveros Trias de Bes .
We are in favour of awareness at this particular time of the difficulties of the European Union , both in terms of a budgetary freeze and of negotiating within the frameworks that we have already negotiated .
This rise is once again excessive , and the Commission &apos;s efforts inadequate , considering what is currently being done in many Member States .
The budget gap is the responsibility of the Council of Ministers and the Council has steadfastly refused to remedy the deficiency .
My reaction is that we can do much better than this in future .
So what is the situation now ?
Question Time ( Commission )
That might well not always be the case but we feel that competition as such is a good thing and we would like that to apply to more destinations than at the moment .
The directive also provides that , when a Member State has reasonable doubts - after due examination of the licence presented for acceptance - as to the equivalence of the licence concerned , it may consider that additional tests or requirements are necessary to enable the licence to be accepted .
I do not think it is just an issue for Member States when you are dealing with an international situation .
That document also describes four initiatives currently being prepared and which concern the movement of women and girls for sex exploitation purposes , and sex tourism with child victims by means of the provision of audiovisual services , in particular via the Internet .
It has taken the Council more than four years to deal with what is a very tricky issue .
It ought to be possible for small producers - and big ones too , by all means - to state that their products do not contain a particular ingredient .
We need to find out if any of the Member States already has a successful health monitoring system in operation and , if so , it should be used as the basis for the European system .
This point was very strongly made by Mr Poggiolini .
Yet we are still having to wait for the Commission to come up with a proposal for a framework directive which should give us what we feel is missing from this communication : concerted action on quality objectives and emission standards - both quality and quantity objectives , and top priority for the ecological quality of water .
I warmly welcome , therefore , the call for a much broader and better framework than there is at the moment .
The system of E numbers is unique to Europe , and was intended precisely as a means of guaranteeing clear and transparent information for consumers on what their food contains .
B4 @-@ 0974 / 96 by Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen and Mr Moorhouse , on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party , on the situation in Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0975 / 96 by Mr Telkämper and others , on behalf of the Green Group in the European Parliament , on the situation in Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0976 / 96 by Mrs Kinnock and Mrs Jensen , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on the European Union response to the situation in Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0978 / 96 by Mr Dupuis , on behalf of the Group of the European Radical Alliance , on Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0982 / 96 by Mrs Baldi and others , on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group , on the situation in Burma ; -B4 @-@ 0984 / 96 by Mr Pettinari , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left / Nordic Green Left , on relations between the European Union and Burma .
Mr President , I fully share the deep concern of Mrs Maij @-@ Weggen and colleagues about the continuing deterioration of the situation in Burma .
Thank you very much , Mrs Kinnock .
While the summit did not result in any significant decisions , it certainly provided a valuable opportunity for the heads of state or government to discuss the state of progress of the negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference .
That is immediately clear if you consider how impossible it is for the courts to prosecute criminals who move to another Member State ; in such cases they are able to act only by means of letters of request - a lengthy and impracticable process which leaves the person under investigation plenty of time to regularize his situation .
Thirdly , we must transform our ineffective and stumbling CFSP into a credible and effective foreign and security policy .
As Parliament &apos;s rapporteur on the IGC I would , however , like to once again stress the important points . First of all it is to make the European Union more transparent .
Thus an expansion of basic education provision can be both a targeted anti @-@ poverty measure and an investment for general economic growth .
According to FAO statistics 800 million people suffer from hunger .
One of the critical issues which is blocking the programmes is the fear that by continuing with the kind of programmes that are proposed under Article 235 subsidiarity will in some way be overtaken or set aside .
The Danish social democrats believe that cooperation between the EU countries in the health sector is a good thing , when we are talking about research and the exchange of statistics .
Europe agreement with Slovenia
It will not be long before we have the Slovene elections : we have no desire to influence the outcome but we must voice the hope that Slovenia &apos;s future parliament and government will rapidly comply with the agreements with the European Union and with Italy , aware that that is the only way in which Slovenia will be able to obtain full membership of the European Union .
The European Union sets high standards , both economically and politically , for the would @-@ be new Member States from Central and Eastern Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Council adopted the action plan for Russia on 13 May 1996 .
Mr President , in the few minutes available to me I will try to address the questions raised .
Fifty years after Nuremberg , national socialism never ceases to be judged over and over again .
We discussed employment in the budget debate . This morning we discussed employment during the poverty debate .
Madam President , let me first of all thank Mr Theonas and indeed Members of the House for the very efficient and speedy way in which they have dealt with the Commission proposal to set up this employment and labour market policy committee .
I also believe that one of the reasons for the possible incorporation of Schengen into EU regulations is an attempt to create a more unified and homogeneous State .
I was very interested to hear the President @-@ in @-@ Office &apos;s reply .
It is very important for the salmon industry in Scotland and Ireland . They are at present facing a predatory practice by Norway which we are debating later this week .
But this is only part of it .
The Council will also give priority to the review of the Naples Convention on mutual assistance between customs administrations , on the Customs 2000 strategy programme for the Third Pillar , and on EU participation in the strategic plan of the World Customs Organization for implementing an operative measure on the Balkan drug smuggling route .
Then we have to ask why the largest Member State of the European Union did not bolt the door a long time ago , for since we do not have a harmonized criminal law we can go on having discussions in this House as long as we want .
Mr President , it will already be apparent to you that we have before us two excellent reports , both of which address the vital subject of how to protect tax @-@ payers &apos; interests .
I hope this report , with the Commission &apos;s help - and we expect quite a lot from Commissioner Kinnock - will make some small contribution towards improving safety at sea , the safety of ships and those who work on them , so that we may not have such frequent cause to mourn the shipwrecks we all know about as we did during the past year .
As you see , Commissioner , we are not far apart , and I count on the support of the house tomorrow so that we can consider all the problems in a more general light .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 10.00 a.m .
You can all see how difficult that is from the efforts the Member States are making at national level and from the fairly meagre results .
Mr President , two very short final questions .
I would like the services to correct that before the second reading .
Unfortunately , there is no real way in which we can seriously influence the biggest items of expenditure , such as agricultural policy , which must be fundamentally changed and transformed if it is not to become a millstone to the EU budget and , moreover , an obstacle to enlargement .
Theonas report
More successful was work done for the disabled tourist and the vital collection of statistics revealing the true state and nature of the tourism industry .
So I should like to thank all those who have helped to get sex tourism placed firmly on the agenda and I am not saying that the events in Belgium are responsible for that , tourism played no part in those .
In one recent incident in Kabul these police actually beat nurses in a hospital who were arriving to help the injured and the dying .
Unfortunately Bellacruz is not an isolated case , rather it is the tip of the iceberg .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are officially debating Cyprus , but the real issue is once again the illiberal conduct of the Turkish Government , both in Turkey and in Cyprus .
But not enough has been said about the fact that within this country and in Khartoum , there are also demonstrations by civil society .
The European Parliament must speak out strongly on this issue .
The Council of Europe should at least have waited until the country had satisfied the requirements which the Council itself had set earlier this year .
At the request of the President , Mrs Bonino and Mr Pinheiro , a crisis cell has been set up since Wednesday , 23rd October , at the European Community Humanitarian Office , ECHO .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
It would be tedious to repeat what other colleagues have already said , although I do want to mention that I find it difficult to fathom the European Commission &apos;s failure to include in its original text Parliament &apos;s request , twice approved by a majority , in the December 1994 and February 1996 plenaries , to promote the creation of a European Tourist Agency - necessary from every point of view .
We managed this morning to retain the budget line for tourism , but it was not easy .
Given the declining use of the railways we have been seeing for years now it is high time we made sure that more than just lip service is paid to supporting the railways but that vigorous action is taken too in the interests of a sustainable future .
There is no reason to introduce some kind of legal basis for a policy on tourism into the Treaty of Rome .
We have already seen President Clinton pushing through a new agricultural law .
This agreement covers the period from January 1996 to January 1999 , and is a renewal of an agreement of the same type .
But meanwhile , in the precarious situation in which Community producers find themselves here and now , the action we request is the only possible response to the emergency conditions we are experiencing , since the future of the salmon farming industry demands these decisions .
When we talk about the Indian Ocean , the regional approach would mean simultaneously taking into consideration Madagascar , Mauritius , the Comoros and the Seychelles .
I am going to invite Mr McMahon to speak , and I apologize to him because he should have had the floor before Mr Imaz .
Despite having chosen to vote for the report in this instance , this does not mean that we have a positive attitude towards routine support for producer organisations .
The rural areas must not degenerate into a museum of folklore .
The debate is closed .
No , there are no surpluses !
I was the rapporteur for the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities when the House approved my proposal to add the following final sentence to this Rule : &apos; The Secretary @-@ General shall see to it that this disciplinary measure is carried out immediately , with the assistance of the staff of Parliament &apos;s Security Service . &apos; 
And that is why , along with other minor amendments also , we think it important to retain that concept and include it in a different , amended version , adopting the fundamentals of the Manzella proposal but including this important specification .
The Commission was mentioned in relation to bureaucratic obstacles .
The Council wished to give this regulation a life @-@ span of three years whereas the Commission proposed that it should be of unlimited duration .
In that context it is important that the special meeting of the United Nations General Assembly scheduled for June 1997 for the purpose of reviewing the results of the Rio Conference be properly prepared .
I am grateful to the rapporteur and to the House for the fact that we have been able to discuss this issue in a way that is genuinely free from ideology , without ending up apportioning blame , for example to the Church .
In general terms , vast amounts of energy are being wasted in the EU as a whole .
But we regret , too , that the Energy Council has had no substantive discussion of the question of rational planning techniques .
Behind this arcane concept lies something that is basically worthwhile .
In the Member States which are the main producers of olive oil , there has still been no improvement in the olive cultivation registers , although this has been called for by the Council and Parliament .
The Commission now discusses its priorities first , before deciding on individual credit allocations .
Mr Killilea , as you have all noticed , has taken advantage of the change of Presidency , but that will not happen in the case of the next speakers .
Mrs Theato and other Members asked how the 5.9 % of irregularities are to be judged .
Advertising is the main source of funding for commercial television companies and these are vital for the proper development of the audiovisual system and information plurality .
None of the provisions on television should apply to them either : not everything which has sound and image is television .
Final point : the inclusion of a clause preventing the relocation of broadcasters to neighbouring states .
All of these will restrict money going into good European programmes .
They are also very concerned about the pressure they are under to buy expensive toys for their children .
In point of fact , according to Amendment No 29 , which we have adopted , the &apos; Member States &apos; - and indeed it would not otherwise be possible - &apos; shall ensure that broadcasters under their jurisdiction do not broadcast cinematographic works outside periods agreed with the rightholders &apos; , whereas Amendment No 56 provides for what is to be done in the absence of contracts to regulate timing , the media time @-@ scales , and can therefore be considered a supplementary amendment .
At the second reading of the proposal to amend the television without frontiers directive , I shall only be able to support the Galeote @-@ Hoppenstedt recommendation if a sensible solution is found to the following key issues .
Indeed , that is essential .
The question is whether through this programme , involving ECU 25 m over two years in the first instance - with which a total credit volume of perhaps ECU 1 billion can be achieved - we can actually create a decisive impact on unemployment .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at first sight , they appear to be very different subjects : competition policy , support for small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , the promotion of employment , relocation , the internal market .
I am also surprised at some of my colleagues .
On the one hand , she says that she has great confidence in the Commission &apos;s competition policy , but on the other she is less than enthusiastic about its policy towards firms with exclusive rights and its liberalization policy .
An undertaking will go where it can operate most productively , and if it is flexible enough , it will be able to absorb a certain wage level in the organization of its work .
Within the current system , we are making a considerable effort to persuade the finance ministers that it is in the interests of the Member States themselves that there should be better coordination .
Perhaps I should first give some information relating to the disease and its treatment and then to the Commission &apos;s direct action .
Mr von Habsburg will have realized that I entirely agree with him , but I have no information or evidence to suggest that Austria is not cooperating in helping refugees to return home .
Subject : Swedish derogation concerning imports of alcohol for personal use
That means that it will not be possible to make a full assessment of the new system until that time .
The first one concerned the fact that , in order to guarantee the simultaneous entry into force of this proposal and the other one amending the regulation on the exporting of cultural objects , since there are two interdependent texts - the regulation and the directive - with a joint annex , it was suggested that the six @-@ month period laid down for the incorporation of the directive into national law should commence from the date of publication rather than the date of adoption .
The Committee of Inquiry into BSE , moreover , showed that Europe really does have something to worry about .
We have tabled amendments dealing in greater detail with how the budget can be adapted to take more account of environmental concerns , and what is to be made of &apos; green accounting &apos; .
There are some points which I would really like to bring out and focus on in the report , including the following :
I must therefore ask about Nos 4 , 5 and 14 .
It is in this spirit that the Commission has considered Parliament &apos;s amendments .
The President , who has responsibility here , cannot do anything about this time @-@ lag , but it is up to our group to rally round and ensure that environmental issues are discussed at times when there are people sitting and listening in the public gallery , because the environment is something which really is of interest to many of our citizens , who appreciate that it can only be regulated by joint action .
Another important requirement with regard to this is that the descriptions must be sufficiently clear in themselves for determining which projects come under the annex .
That applies , for instance , to the amendment on the need first to sort waste and only thereafter dump or incinerate it ; the same applies to the sorting of organic waste .
The overall impression is that there are many areas in which the USA seems more interested in confrontation than consensus at the WTO , and we hope that Singapore will show that the USA can find time to pause for reflection .
We believe that core labour standards derived from ILO Conventions need to be included at that point in Article 20 of the WTO regulations .
But we are not totally in agreement on these ourselves . Even within the European Union we are divided .
This is a question not of protectionism , Commissioner , but of &apos; core &apos; rights , for example the right to freedom of association , the protection of children against exploitation in the form of child labour .
We have heard from a number of Portuguese Members , for example , who have spoken very vocally and vividly about that .
I stress this point of the need to facilitate voluntary return , which is laid down in every convention on refugees and in humanitarian legislation . The second function of this force will be to move the food supplies , and the third will be to protect the refugees themselves , the equipment and the humanitarian personnel .
The question on the lips of civilians , the NGOs and especially the victims of the warfare , and which I now ask the Council , is the following : why is this capability not being put to good use ?
I therefore suggest that the words &apos; to return home &apos; should be replaced by the words &apos; wishing to return home to do so &apos; .
It would be expedient to take advantage of the Intergovernmental Conference to clarify all this and restore order .
It is helpful that the rapporteur does not wish to &quot; depart &apos; from the principle of subsidiarity , but the proposals in the resolution will tend to stifle it .
NGOs will continue to be kept waiting outside while economic experts representing governments take decisions that affect us all .
In the same way , he will monitor actions by either side which might prejudice the outcome of the permanent status negotiations .
Each of the parties , then , must be sure to resist the provocations which extremists of all persuasions are going out of their way to create .
This approach is as dangerous as it is out of place , if only because it casts doubt on the impartiality of our judgement .
It is in all our interests that the peace process should continue and indeed be accelerated because nobody likes the frustrations of the present moment .
The proposals will reinforce the provisions of the current directive with regard to a central computerized database , a passport for each animal , a double ear @-@ tagging arrangement for identifying each animal and registers of animals on each holding .
He has announced a referendum on his proposal to be held on 7 November .
Commissioner Monti pointed to the Commission &apos;s intention to follow the line indicated by Parliament , upholding and supporting the amending clause .
In relation to the first part of his question , the country that has not signed is Belgium .
The threat to Aung San Suu Kyi , which we heard about today , is just part of the repression from the government there .
On the other hand , if I oppose the Commission document things are even worse , because in that case I shall be shooting it down , and it will be said at the Commission and at the Council and at the Intergovernmental Conference that the document proposed by the Commission did not even receive the support of Parliament .
Mr President , I should simply like to say what Fernand Herman would certainly have said if he was here , and give an answer , in particular , to my colleague and friend Mr Berthu .
Lastly , a comment on the amendments we shall be voting on tomorrow .
Such things should not happen in a constitutional state .
Similarly , we are opposed to the drawing up of a list of so @-@ called safe countries .
Now that the internal market has been completed , the barriers have fallen , and cross @-@ border business transactions are increasing , together , of course , with all the problems associated with them .
I cannot fit everybody in if we carry on taking extra time .
Nor do I agree with point 8 about labelling .
That is normally done under other Community legislation .
That means , energy must be saved and energy sources must be promoted which produce less CO2 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in today &apos;s joint debate I should like to thank the various rapporteurs and offer them my personal congratulations .
Consumers , distributors and collectives have not received the attention they deserve .
The uncertainty it produces certainly does not promote a continuous commitment on the part of the producers or greater investment by processing firms .
In conclusion I wish to thank all Members for their great support .
In the cereals sector the Commission is in a position to control them exactly .
In this connection the Commission undertakes to prepare a communication for the Industry Council meeting of 2 February or 17 April 1997 .
The Commission would like to draw Mr Tamino &apos;s attention to the fact that the directive does not include an obligation on Member States to inform the Commission of how many inspections they have carried out , what failures they have discovered and what sanctions they have imposed .
We can deliver what people want and should aim for what I asked for many years ago , namely the slaughter of animals at the nearest point of production or farming .
But the expected arrests have not taken place and crime and impunity permeate the whole of society , particularly the Republika Srpska and also the Croatian part .
Somehow we must end this transfer of valuable protein .
My feeling is that people honestly see us as applying double standards in our international relations .
After the collapse of the Soviet Union Georgia became one of the first successor states to declare its independence and democratically elect its President , Swiad Gamsakurdia .
But I have to admit that in practice there sometimes seems to be little critical dialogue and a great deal of economic dialogue .
Part @-@ sessions are primarily an arena for various Members to make proclamations .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if there is a cornerstone upon which the whole construction of the Common Fisheries Policy rests it is undoubtedly the conservation of fishery resources .
But precisely because the Commission is convinced of its importance , it will not skimp its efforts to try to convince the other two countries to accept this component in the various agreements as well .
Let me also congratulate Mr Posselt on his past work in connection with Slovenia .
A mere few percent of the EU budget represents a financial loss of tens of millions of kronor .
For us , as a peripheral region , Parliament &apos;s report should include for these regions the funding of commercial infrastructures which mean that potentials can be exploited and small producers can be assisted in organizing a sector with a great future for an economically depressed region .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
That is the reasoning behind Amendment No 10 from the Socialist Group to paragraph 3 .
As the House will know , and several speakers have already said , the Kalanke judgment of the Court of Justice in October 1995 generated controversy , to say the least , throughout Europe about the legitimacy of quotas and of other forms of positive action that are aimed at increasing the number of women in particular sectors or levels of employment .
( The sitting was closed at 11.30 am )
The figures given range from 250 , 000 and 750 , 000 but whatever the true number , it is amazing .
She was obviously already very strongly focused on the issue .
I would be misrepresenting the reality to this Parliament if I were to pretend otherwise .
We know that the decision on the first President of the Central Bank will be a matter for the heads of State and Government , after consulting the European Parliament , but despite that I thought it was important to obtain such a clear statement of intent from Mr Duisenberg .
Consequently , in stage three of EMU , it will be necessary to establish a balance between the goal of stability for the single currency and the goal of support for the development efforts of participants and non @-@ participants in EMU .
From a combination of ignorance , arrogance , laziness , fear and loathing it studiously demotes or denigrates the reasoned response of this Parliament to the concerns and worries of the man and woman in the street in Britain today , not the least anxiety of which is the search for jobs .
As Article 109l ( 4 ) requires Council to act with the unanimity of those Member States without a derogation , this second proposal will not be adopted until later .
All of us here know that .
This changes .
I should be grateful for an answer to those questions tonight .
The reports contain a number of things on which we can agree , but there are also unresolved questions that are not dealt with : employment problems caused by precipitate budgetary consolidation , saving until there is nothing more to save , taking account of criteria for real convergence that go beyond Mr Christodoulou &apos;s sensible approaches .
Mr President , the reports by Mr Metten , Mr Herman , Mr Harrison , Mr Christodoulou and Mr Hoppenstedt have once again led us to talk of convergence criteria and the coordination of budgetary policies , so as to get the single currency rolling - rolling into the &apos; Euro @-@ tunnel &apos; .
That would bring about an economic climate which would certainly increase unemployment dramatically .
It would just raise the pressure on workers and on the job market .
If the Member State in question takes no corrective action , it must be prepared for the Council to apply the provisions of the Treaty , in other words to activate a sanctions mechanism .
Mr Herman , there is no problem here .
Bearing in mind the great scarcity of resources , we do need to create much greater public acceptance of what we are doing .
The idea behind the matrix approach proposed by Mr Desama , with its intersections between traditional fields and disciplines on the horizontal axis and the major problems facing Europe on the vertical axis , is very well reflected in the way in which the structure of the programmes is defined in the Commission &apos;s first working document on the Fifth Framework Programme .
Road transport offers two particularly good ways of doing this : increased use of public transport , enabling more passengers to be carried for a lower energy input , and developing vehicles which use less energy , or different forms of energy .
I was not sniggering at the comment .
Why must Europe recommend that to the local and regional authorities ?
I regret that but he understands the reasons why I have to take this approach .
For then it is dark in the early morning when children go off to school .
We have had good experience of this .
But could not man return to the mythical era of the golden age when he did not have to work and when poetry and labour were one and the same ?
The issue , and our common objective , is to create an economic , legal and political framework which really favours employment .
I think we should put on our agenda the points that Mr Santer raised this morning , including the European statute and the financing of transEuropean networks .
The Ribeiro report makes an important contribution to planning the social dimension of the Union , and the Group of the European People &apos;s Party will vote in favour of it .
We must act resolutely to promote schemes which will create small- and medium @-@ sized enterprises , especially in the service sector , to ease the employment situation ; at the same time , we need to strengthen the vocational training programmes aimed at young people , women and the long @-@ term unemployed but not at slackers and loafers .
Mr Lage stresses also that this is a policy for the long term and he particularly highlights the need to develop local development and for the creation of small business .
Furthermore , while stigmatizing the national authorities , the stability pact will give the European Central Bank ( ECB ) an alibi for penalizing , by raising the European interest rate , an accidental drift by one or more Member States .
And it is only if it has done nothing to that effect by 31 December 1997 that the entry into force is automatically set for 1 January 1999 .
Once again , an act of barbarism has been committed on European soil .
Combating supply may well be justified from a legal or even moral standpoint , but it has little long @-@ term effect .
As far as I am concerned , there can be no question about the illegality of drugs .
This meets the concern of the European Parliament that a consumer buying products with the manufacturer &apos;s label should be given an adequate degree of security by having a broad range of information , without at the same time permitting a mass of confusing , onesided detail which has no place in the recognized labelling system .
This is crucially important if the internal market is to function smoothly .
It would make an important contribution towards credibility and the securing of legitimacy if that further implementation were based on two authorizing orders , as additions to Article 138a , for the adoption of a regulatory framework for the legal status , rights and obligations of European political parties , and a corresponding framework for their economics .
At European or international level , they are merely confederations of national parties .
Without these essential prerequisites for a genuinely thriving democracy , the rights of the European Parliament must remain limited .
Johanna Maij @-@ Weggen and I have opened up this possibility , by organizing public meetings .
Thank you for your attention , and I again congratulate the rapporteur .
Mr President , I believe that the political groups are more or less in agreement in delivering a negative verdict on the manner in which the Commission carried out its programme for 1996 .
1997 should also be the year when an even balance is finally achieved between a macroeconomic policy focusing on stability and growth and an employment policy focusing on creating jobs . Work on this should start very soon - this weekend , in fact .
The result has been to undermine the credibility of the Union in this sector .
It is true that , in this respect , Europe does not project the best possible image of itself to third countries or its own citizens .
That would have been a saving overall .
I think that farmers particularly in the peripheral regions in Ireland , Northern Ireland and Scotland have to be grateful to the Commission , Parliament and the Council for the prompt attention which has been given to this problem and the resources which have been provided to meet the worst crisis those people have faced in a whole generation .
The Council &apos;s dominance has led some of our colleagues to suggest breaking the Interinstitutional Agreement .
As a consequence of this , Parliament has stressed the need for implementation of a broad spectrum of provisions , ranging from general public information to a targeted effort for special risk groups .
We believe in subsidiarity and initiatives from the ground up rather than from the top down .
So we have the problem here in the House that we cannot summon up 314 votes for a policy that dares to risk confrontation with the Council in order to achieve a generally acceptable result , the kind of result which Commissioner Liikanen said this morning that he would like to see .
No specific predictions can be made , or worked into this report , but I see this as an interim report which , as Mr Christodoulou has said , will need to be followed up by others .
Finally I should like to mention our disagreement with the report in relation to two specific aspects : the close link it establishes between enlargement and EMU - when we know full well that even the current Member States are not adopting it , because they do not want to or because they cannot - and the requirement for the applicant countries to adopt ultra @-@ liberal economic and social models , particularly shocking given that the report does not mention social issues once .
It concludes that the Union &apos;s own resources , in other words the revenue raised from taxpayers , must be increased .
Enlargement has constitutional consequences .
It is in fact in countries with the highest wages , the highest taxes and the highest contributions that farmers have to manage their money most carefully .
Welcome , but once again premature , is - in my view - the reference to codecision on agricultural issues which has to be decided and discussed in a more appropriate forum .
Contrary to what the rapporteur intended , we are in such a hurry that we now risk sending out the wrong signal .
I hope you will not take that off my one minute , of course !
It is a very appropriate question .
It was still not clear from the Commissioner &apos;s answer precisely what legal redress a citizen has if information about that person is placed by mistake on a register with Europol .
In the course of the negotiations , and if necessary , the Commission could return to the Council asking for additional directives in order to conclude an agreement which fulfils the aspirations and interests of both parties .
How can the Commission help the social partners , the employers and the trade unions to get on board and run model action programmes ?
Bearing in mind the recent public health scares related to cattle , what action has the Commission taken , or is proposing to take , to examine the causes of scrapie in sheep ?
Whatever the outcome of the vote the Socialist Group will continue to press the issues of public concern through all the avenues that are open to it .
The transportation costs are the same , while a gas @-@ fired power station , on the other hand , pays for itself much more quickly , for much lower sums invested .
The directive points out that economic preference may be given to coal because all the coal which the States have and require can be used to the extent of 15 % of primary energy .
Madam President , my congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Herman , on his report which the Socialist Group will be supporting .
From today , public access for schools , libraries and hospitals should figure in the basic list for universal service .
I agree with the rapporteur that we need a European definition for affordability , and that means , as far as I am concerned , a formula we can apply to each Member State , in the light of its economic condition at any moment in time .
This is ultimately an original service , which should be paid for from a budget .
At a time when we are making such an effort to help European citizens feel part and parcel of the Union that we are building , in which special programmes are being launched - such as CITIZENS FIRST - to enlighten Europeans and bring them closer , win them over , the Commission is proposing that , against the will of the elected institutions - the European Parliament and the Council - decisions be taken over the process of liberalizing one of the sectors closest to our people , a sector that they feel to be theirs , namely the postal services .
Do not forget that in the United States there is a postal monopoly .
) Mr President , I would just like to complain in the strongest possible terms that the majority in this House did not seem to understand how important it was that the European Parliament allowed their voice to be heard before the UN General Assembly when a very large majority decided in favour of commencing negotiations on the abolition of nuclear weapons .
It is widely recognized in the context of the Great Lakes region that a humanitarian response alone represents no solution to its problems .
We want to see an extension of codecision and a more democratic and effective third pillar .
I have said to you before and I say it again : align yourself with Germany .
And our own Foreign Ministers , the Heads of State , the leaders of the centre and left parties , when they talk about the Serbian situation will use any word , any term , any turn of phrase , any analogy to avoid uttering one particular word , that word , one term , that term , one definition , that definition , which would make things clearer and more obvious to all .
I wish to thank the Presidents of both Council and the Commission .
International crime has a turnover of billions .
He will also know that his fellow Commissioner , Mr Van den Broek , made it categorically clear he would not withdraw the proposals if this Parliament disagreed .
If we stick to a one @-@ sided , biased view of the situation we risk reigniting the Balkan fire that was extinguished with such great difficulty in Bosnia last year .
The hesitations in Bosnia , Chechnya , Rwanda , Zaire , but also in Turkey , China and elsewhere , show how difficult it is to act , for either prevention or cure .
The list of acts of violence perpetrated by man against his fellow man continues to increase , as Mrs Lalumière , who is exceptionally knowledgeable on this subject , ably reminds us in her excellent report .
As you are aware this is being discussed at this very moment at the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore ; these issues , as you well know , are very controversial especially when there are seen in relation to rules on international trade .
In any case , there is no practical problem , because the very sharp fall in the birth rate in Europe means that there are on average ten applications for adoption for every abandoned child .
Just one example : free movement of workers - a cornerstone of the market - also means free movement of families , with all attendant problems of adjustment for children in a new society . Free movement of workers also means free movement of paedophiles across state borders .

I fail to understand how the Commission and Member States can imagine how the wetlands can be preserved and protected without extra funds .
It was because we did not want the MEDA credits to be taken hostage - this being a problem which relates solely to relations between the European Union and Turkey - that we opposed the blocking of those credits .
What I have done over the last two and a half years may sometimes have been right , may sometimes have been wrong , but it was always done in the belief that I was serving the interests of cooperation between our peoples in the European Union and in our Parliament .
As this is the text of a law , all of it should be available in Swedish .
In the framework of the work carried out on this directive , we now await the initiatives of the Commission and the discussions in Council so that this error can be rectified .
The rapporteur , then , is under the spell of figures , balance sheets and cost estimates , and loses sight of the unique and historical opportunity of eastward expansion , and its importance in terms of peace policy .
Today &apos;s debate is in itself a demonstration of this .
Let us have a rest , a good rest , at least once a week on a Sunday .
The dismissal of the chairman of the electoral commission and Lukaschenko &apos;s unilateral declaration that the result was binding have made the picture worse .
Nothing is said here about genuine resocialization , there is no call for a change in social conditions , but ultimately it &apos;s just the same old story , even if there are signs of more praiseworthy efforts : we do nothing to change economic policy , and we still deal with the oligarchies in these countries .
Mr President , the delegation of Alleanza Nazionale hopes that the trust Europe has placed in Croatia , and in Slovenia , will not be betrayed by dishonest behaviour that is quite unacceptable of countries that want to call themselves European and hope to become a part of the European Union .
I should like to see Europeans , and all those interested in the future of Algeria , establishing a presence through the press , through the NGOs , or even , as far as the European Union is concerned , on the occasion of the negotiation of the agreement with Algeria , a physical presence in that country and intervening between terrorism and its inevitable repression .
Reality calls for two types of measures to be implemented .
Although it is true that hundreds of thousands of refugees have been able to return to Rwanda - and it goes without saying that we are going to help them , that we are going to be there and indeed have been there for two years - I must point out to you that there are also , lost in the Kivu , several hundred thousand more refugees whom we cannot help .
The light went on .
This should cause a stir in plenty of European capitals and bring another trial of strength with the Commission and the Council !
1.Children are entitled to be protected and guided , preferably by both parents together in a family environment .
National laws must be aligned where necessary .
... although , as I understood , there were several instances , not just one , of grave irregularities in this Chamber during voting .
In conclusion , although this comes in the form of a recommendation and not a directive , it is nevertheless an important proposal which , if enacted , will be another step towards enabling disabled people to take advantage of the freedom of movement enjoyed by other European citizens .
In Spain , 24 % of the population is unemployed and this rises to 70 % for people with disabilities .
We can say that we are all marching to the same tune .
There was a card vote from Mrs Baldi when she was not present , and that gives rise to the application of paragraph 1 of Rule 110 .
I should take this opportunity to thank our rapporteur , and Mr Arias Cañete , as chairman , who have enabled particularly important improvements to be made to the initial proposal .
Finally , I am very pleased that Mr von Wogau has shown , as chairman , how closely he listens to people who have worked in Finnish forests and have had to drink vodka , and so on . I am sure when I bring forward the concerns from Ireland and my constituency , I can rely on him displaying his acute listening skills and showing the same sympathy .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
First , Community preference .
They should be offered best quality bananas at the lowest possible prices .
The economic survival of many parts of my constituency will depend on such a subdivision .
It prevents depopulation , but it also promotes regional stability .
Mr President , the structural imbalances detected in the systems for basic areas and regionalization plans for the various Member States led the November 1995 Agriculture Council to adopt an agreement by which the Commission was charged with drawing up and presenting , in January 1996 , a proposal amending Council Regulation 1765 / 92 , in order to make the sanctions system more flexible .
The Commission &apos;s proposals also stipulate that by 1 January 1998 a database must be set up in every Member State to store all the animals &apos; identification numbers with age , sex and date of birth , together with details of their arrival at or departure from farms .
We are facing a time of historical change , which is opening up new horizons .
The first is that you should ensure that the decisions taken by the political organs of Parliament - the Bureau and the Conference of Presidents - should be precisely and promptly implemented by the administration , which has not always been the case in the past .
I would say as well that in any parliamentary democracy it is the majority in the House that determines who should hold the presidency .
I think this is a kind of manipulation we cannot accept !
I was not present at the vote in question , so I do not wish to comment on what took place on the Thursday of the last part @-@ session .
However , the fact that I read out his letter does not mean that I accept or endorse what he said in his own defence .
Our thinking is very introspective - and necessarily so - because unless we get things in order internally we shall not be able to take external action .
It is true that neither the question of relations between trade and environment nor that of basic social standards saw the breakthrough for which the Commission was hoping .
However , at the institutional level and on the question of flexibility , we are disappointed that more progress has not been made .
I particularly welcome the commitment to streamline the codecision procedure , thus putting both sides of the European Union legislature , the Council of Ministers representing the Member States and us , in the European Parliament , representing the people , on a truly equal footing .
However , it remains the case that Parliament &apos;s status at such a conference is unclear .
It will be an important point in Europe &apos;s history .
A presidency and a Commission cannot achieve anything when it becomes clear in Singapore that the European Union is divided on the question of rules in this area .
The ability to be flexible should allow scope for both , whereas without flexibility , a much larger Union will grind to a halt .
It is difficult , certainly , since it has made the interaction between government and democracy at European and national levels much more complicated .
How can you hope to have a creative , courageous agenda when you are so divided amongst yourselves ?
The Irish proposals provide a useful platform here .
A monetary union which is not also a social and ecological union and which does not create jobs could well fall victim to divisions between the governments and suspicion from the public , so as far as I am concerned , EMU can stay on hold until we have a better treaty which makes the Union more democratic and decisive , a hard enough task in itself .
What is certain is that by acting accordingly , the Dutch presidency will make its own contribution to the edifice of a Europe of poverty and unemployment .
Is that not simply the Netherlands Government acting in its own interests ?
This means that if I have to conduct an election campaign in my country and need some green T @-@ shirts , and they supply me with red T @-@ shirts , then while I may well be able to dispose of them to the socialists , I actually wanted green ones . It must therefore be possible for me to return the red T @-@ shirts and get my money back on them .
Parliament did not get absolutely everything on its Christmas list !
Nevertheless , I should like to begin today by congratulating Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt on the creativeness and ingenuity with which she has managed to extract the best possible result for consumers from the proposals that went to the Conciliation Committee .
I hope that the text will be adopted by a very large majority in the vote tomorrow .
I simply referred to the statement by the rapporteur , Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt , that this regulation offered total protection .
Mr President , before we begin the debate on the Bertens report , I should like to draw your attention to a procedural matter : we are about to debate two reports by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy but we have yet to hear the opinions of either the Delegation for relations with Latin America or the Delegation for relations with Central America .
The European Union must become an active partner capable of formulating and submitting coordinated , innovative proposals to alleviate the burden of external debt of Latin American countries .
But we are not stimulating production by Latin American countries because , in fact , they are competitive in many products and , in many cases , we are closing our markets to them .
Similarly , in adopting a stance in favour of intensifying the political dialogue between the European Union and Central America , we must suggest that both the European Parliament and PARLACEN should play an increased role in this , these being the only parliaments in the world directly elected on a transnational basis , and that a Civil Society Consultative Forum be set up , in which initiatives such as the ICIC and bodies such as the CIFCA can be included and take part .
It is pointless to speak of subsidiarity in this connection .
I fear that following the improvements made in 1993 and 1994 the delays are getting a lot worse .
Up until now , air navigation has been - and is still - managed by national systems .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 noon .
There is no reason to accept this in times of tight finances throughout the EU .
At the end of the day fishermen will be isolated .
This involves not only the juveniles of commercially important , targeted species but also other species that are not wanted by fishermen .
Finally , the common fisheries policy must not be confined exclusively to issues under the three headings of monitoring , capacities and technical measures .
Frustration at the narrow range of the decisions taken and the postponement of the most important ones , and uneasiness because , in my view , some of the decisions are inexplicable .
I do not want to go over these again .
The question immediately arises of expanding forestry resources .
A stable and effective multilateral trading system is of great importance for settling trade disputes and placing international trade within a framework of social and ecological rules .
Any foodstuffs which contain or consist of genetically modified organisms must be labelled as such .
From the first reading in May 1995 to today we represented Parliament &apos;s view in intensive discussions and negotiations and I believe we have made a considerable improvement on the original proposal in the citizen &apos;s interests .
The common practice amongst foresters was , until Helsinki , just to stick to the rule that you could not harvest more timber than was growing back .
It already has enough work coping with the tasks in hand .
Mr President , the last enlargement brought a deeper interest and even a passion into the debate on forestry in this Community .
I should point out that with this second agreement , the agreement on telecommunications contracts , the European Union and Israel have anticipated the outcome of the Uruguay Round .
We hope that this group , which has already started work , will take the time to work out a definitive proposal .
For indeed we need time to reflect on the repercussions of the statute of a small European joint @-@ stock company on labour relations , on relations between owners , shareholders , management , the labour force , works councils and trades unions .
I very much hope that the social partners will be willing and able to identify the content of the rules which should apply here and to reach an agreement on how these rules will be put in place .
I therefore call urgently for the adoption of the amendment from our group , presented by my colleague , Mr de Brémond d &apos;Ars , which seeks to increase the amount of Community funding set aside for implementing the necessary action .
Four countries , namely Denmark , Ireland , the United Kingdom and Sweden want to opt out from the regulation on non @-@ automatic data processing .
I have taken note of what Mr Kerr and Mr Tomlinson said though , and I shall open the appropriate investigation into the musical qualities of the person who has been given the responsibility mentioned .
The European Union has decided to commit itself in Transcaucasia .
Primarily , Europe is expressing economic interests , which disregard the problems involved in securing a lasting peace and democratization combined with respect for human rights .
Finally , I would like to use my brief speaking to underline the importance of the Transcaucasian region - especially in with regard to its links with its neighbours , in particular Turkey - in terms of our future energy supplies .
One of the main aspects of this new trend is to make the origins and ingredients of agricultural products clearly identifiable .
It has proposed a new five @-@ year transitional period from 1996 for each product not yet registered , starting from the date of application , instead of from the date originally agreed .
But , there has been a positive development , despite the problems with the Treaty , in that Commissioner Gradin has initiated several good proposals on asylum , &apos; burden sharing &apos; , immigration , corruption and synthetic drugs .
But this cannot be enough .
If we in this Parliament were given an example of a third world country that allowed asylum policy , border controls , the right of third country nationals , the fighting of terrorism , the combatting of fraud , the combatting of drug addiction to escape parliamentary or judicial control , we would be horrified .
But as the debate we are holding here at present has caused a great deal of tumult in some Member States , I should like to repeat one sentence : we do not need to make a special point here of saying that a State that is governed by the principles of the rule of law must also observe those principles in its legal organization , no matter who the accused may be .
We share the rapporteur &apos;s concern over terrorism that takes place within the European democracies , and welcome a co @-@ ordinated approach to preventing it from occurring .
In accordance with article 12 of the Act concerning the election of representatives to the European Parliament by direct universal suffrage , the house recognizes this vacancy and informs the Member State concerned of its existence .
When building new power stations , Eastern European countries could be expected to adhere to the same emission standards for sulphur dioxide , nitrogen oxides and particulates as apply in the West .
It was clear at that time that unless these protocols were taken very seriously , we could end up with a rather dangerous situation .
We therefore need special measures , but we also need commitment on all sides , a much stronger and broader political awareness .
We have also made progress in involving the economic and social partners , both in the framework of the 1995 agreement and in relation to the new Objective 2 programmes .
This applies in particular to the pilot projects , for which only 1 % of structural fund resources are available but which involve a lengthy and costly application procedure and in the end are not authorized for lack of resources .
We note in Mr Hatzidakis &apos; report , but in the opinion delivered by the Environment Committee too , that this cohesion policy is responsible for a lot of environmental damage in the European Union ; that is unacceptable and it violates the Treaty .
It could be said that environment policy is actually liable to be accused of being &apos; anti @-@ cohesive &apos; .
This appears way down as Question No 100 , and not in the section addressed to Commissioner Kinnock .
For this reason , we have tabled an amendment .
However , I believe that social security schemes should certainly not be reformed in a rigid way , but must be adapted to new conditions of employment , particularly with regard to flexibility and mobility , as a number of other Members have pointed out .
Mr President , we need to be worried and to take account of the risk that an untested switch in funding from work @-@ related contributions to alternative tax solutions could lead to a total collapse of the social protection system , particularly in the atmosphere of budgetary pressure that is prevalent in all of the Member States because of EMU .
This does not mean that we should not be getting people back to work , on the contrary , I am all in favour of &apos; activating &apos; benefits , but it does mean that we should now consign the American model to the dustbin once and for all .
Thank you very much .
If she does this before 12.30 p.m. I think she will feel happy about voting with the rest of her group .
The more progress is made in European integration and - in theory - the less important borders become , the more national , not to say nationalist , reactions are complicating and adversely affecting the lives of frontier workers .
When it comes to voting in these committees , the votes are weighted , with the effect that the influence exerted by the different governments is not a function of scientific reason , but of those governments &apos; political will or weight .
By allowing a handful of - mainly British - undertakings to cheat in order to reduce the cost of producing beef , a situation was created which today , ten years on , is costing many - far too many - human lives , as well as billions of ECU to society .
They must be used with care , and I believe that this is what will happen in the autumn if the Commission does not live up to its own formulations .
Firstly , the very existence of this document is an inescapable fact for the Commission , as well as for the Council and the British Government .
Only part of Mr Santer &apos;s speech referred to the committee &apos;s recommendations .
After that , you are free to organize things as you see fit .
That motive was the establishment of the single market .
This affair has a past , a present and a future .
Given that the Permanent Secretary , Mr Packer , who attended in place of Mr Hogg , informed us that BSE was an act of God , we perhaps should be grateful that Douglas Hogg did not attend .
Under the Treaty , the Commission is responsible for monitoring compliance with Community legislation in the Member States .
I should like to underline the three sets of responsibilities highlighted in Mr Medina &apos;s report .
Thirdly , protecting health and the environment must be our constant concern .
There are currently two infringement procedures under Article 169 of the Treaty and , if necessary , the Commission would not hesitate to bring the matter before the Court of Justice .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive reply .
Is it possible to approach Norway for funds , over and above the Interreg cooperation which exists between the countries and which already includes this line , to push this project forward ?
Multi @-@ centre clinical trials should continue to represent an important aspect of medical research activity under the fifth framework programme .
Of course I can launch the thing tomorrow .
Our group welcomes this as a very positive development that should be extended further , which is not to say , of course , that we should not be glad to see environmentally @-@ friendly forms of transport taking a greater share of the market .
Without saving we have no investment .
We would ask the honourable members who made that request to agree to Brunner being an addition rather than a replacement .
It states in its own proposal that the common system of veterinary checks is governed by the aims of completing the internal market and harmonizing health protection .
I believe , too , that stricter labelling requirements would help farmers .
The Mayer report confirms the draft regulations for identifying and registering animals , but also encouraging effective health monitoring of herds and also the management of farming subsidies .
From the measures in hand and those of which we know it appears that the Commission &apos;s resources are being reinforced and the scope for supervision improved .
On the other hand , the quality @-@ conscious consumer nowadays expects an up @-@ to @-@ date system of meat labelling which indicates at least the conditions under which the meat was produced and which makes it possible to trace the origin of the meat back to the farm of origin .
The first question concerns the list of information that must feature on the label .
At the same time , the operation of the single market must be adapted effectively , so that products in circulation or to be circulated will ensure the protection of health and conform with the rules embodied in international agreements .
I hope this meeting will mark a new stage in the necessary rapprochement between the countries and towns we represent .
There is nothing stopping us from obtaining experience in this respect , but we must not rely on federal control of health regulations for an immediate escape from the crisis and chaos .
Equally puzzling was the failure to call the Presidents of the Scientific Veterinary Committee during the relevant period .
There were many negative aspects to the United Kingdom &apos;s conduct and one of them was the failure to guarantee an effective ban on feeding meat and bone meal to ruminants ; not respecting the national bans preventing the import of meal from the United Kingdom ; putting pressure on the European Commission not to carry out inspections .
This is a national matter and not something which should be dealt with at EU level .
I think the priorities for 96 @-@ 98 leave a lot to be desired .
I agree with President Santer &apos;s claim that the European Veterinary Office based in County Meath in Ireland can play a vital role in restoring consumers &apos; confidence in food safety procedures .
I think we are now ready to publish in the Official Journal the result of our work , which has not been easy .
Those are some of the issues we sought to highlight .
We are assessing the best way of balancing out these - at times conflicting - interests .
We must apply quite different principles , and that is the purpose of our resolution .
But if we do not move in the direction of democratic dialogue with a special European envoy , we will come to grief .
The legitimacy enjoyed by the power following the presidential elections does not make all the means it uses also legitimate .
Thirdly , a proposal by the Belgian delegation and others to compile a list of experts and specialist bodies with a view to preventing trafficking in human beings . Fourthly , a Belgian proposal for a collective approach to the prevention of sexual exploitation of children and trafficking in human beings , together with measures for cooperation among Member States .
It would be interesting to know what percentage level we are talking about here .
To take the last question first , I think the solution to the Kashmir question has to be sought by direct talks between the governments concerned .
As for controlling demand , because we are talking here about great cultural differences between countries and widely differing approaches , I think we need in future to acquaint ourselves a lot better with each others &apos; experience , and I touched on that partly in my reply to Mr Stewart @-@ Clark .
We therefore see the consumer as an informed and mobile player , in line with clear rules and with due respect for the commitments entered into . We see the consumer as having a real power of choice , and that can and will act as an incentive and a steer to producers themselves , who will need to make an effort , including at an economic level , to innovate and be creative .
In that connection , I wish to clear up three specific issues .
Member States should compare applicants &apos; qualifications with those required in the host country , and if equivalence is established , an application for recognition should be granted .
I believe that the European Community in particular must set an example by implementing what we are always discussing here concerning the equal treatment of men and women in all areas of our Community .
To sum up , we have moved from a system of quotas in the positions offered to a system of positions reserved by the famous positive discriminations .
I should like to stress that the Commission proposal now under consideration is only a small and partial reform , and not a complete administrative reform .
This was not an ideal way to work but I think we have done remarkably well in the circumstances .
They apparently have a lot of hidden unemployment they want to conceal .
I have always made that point .
I therefore welcome , too , the proposed action plan on satellite communications , which will certainly also include the SPCS services , and I hope that it will encourage European industry to take action and invest .
This reaction is particularly amazing when you consider that it is those same Member States that are constantly calling for a global reaction to global challenges , which certainly include satellite communications .
Since we still have a few minutes left , I can invite the two rapporteurs to speak again , if they so wish .
But I believe it is out of order for amendments to have been proposed and voted upon , and I think that respect for the powers of the Legal Affairs Committee requires that the text should be referred back to it for a decision , in any case , in the light of the decisions taken in this House .
The problem is whether the community should be required to acknowledge forms of union which are not geared to procreation .
Bearing in mind the exceptional gravity of the BSE affair , I should like to explain that vote orally .
Haste and impatience rarely ensure success .
It is our good fortune to be better informed than our predecessors .
The Union cannot afford to lose any more time in coordinating its policy more effectively . If it loses more time it will once again also lose its credibility .
So I regard it as an absolute necessity to come up with a different kind of action .
Far above the gross national income of the country itself .
Majority opinion in this House favours the abolition of the death penalty , and we should always clearly emphasize that .
Mr President , three previous resolutions passed by this Parliament since 1990 have been ignored by the Israeli Government .
I therefore believe that the granting of aid to local NGOs devoted to defending the rights of the local people is worth considering .
The Commission regrets the fact that no Union presence is yet being tolerated in Kosovo , and that Belgrade is even refusing to grant a visa to Mr Vanderstoel , the SOEC High Commissioner for minorities .
But we are not united about the means .
It therefore regards it as essential to pursue a policy that combines combating illegal immigration and the traffic in human beings with the integration of immigrants who are lawfully resident here and the campaign against racism , xenophobia and anti @-@ semitism .
Mr President , Mrs Baldi has presented us with a very detailed report reflecting what happened at the two meetings .
We will not have the necessary concentration on the quality of aid , on the participation of less developed countries themselves .
My conviction is that it would be in our true interest to put our resources at the service of a European development policy which would suddenly take on a new scale and a new ambition .
I remember how Oxfam , for instance , a whole year before the Rwanda catastrophe , pointed out time and time again what was likely to happen there .
However , the actual question that I asked has mysteriously disappeared , and has been replaced by a question that I put to the Irish Council Presidency last year .
I can tell you , however , that in the mean time , once intervention buying had resumed , inspections were carried out in October / November 1996 and the results of those inspections were entirely to the Commission &apos;s satisfaction .
Mr President , I warmly endorse Mrs Lulling &apos;s report .
Yet we hear now that the Commission is considering proposing a new regulation which seeks to exempt Russia and Canada .
Our group fully agrees with you and yet I must say that in view of the brief reply from the Commissioner it would appear that commercial interests are far more important than animal welfare and democratic principles .
The &apos; specific date &apos; is Monday 10 March , as the first item on the agenda for the March part @-@ session .
The reaction of the French Government in saying first that questions of human rights and fundamental freedoms within the European Union are a matter of internal affairs , as Mr Chirac and Mr Hervé de Charette stated , and secondly that the European Parliament has shown that it is superfluous , is completely unacceptable to us .
As regards the last point , Mrs Green , it is no problem to continue the debate on Thursday morning if it does not end on Wednesday .
This opening of the borders is really only a pretty fiction , if that , because what has really happened is that the borders have been shifted inwards a bit .
Mr President , mobility is exactly what the Schengen Agreement is about , something which ought to be of general interest to the majority in this assembly .
Mr President , I am addressing the House on behalf of Mrs Soltwedel @-@ Schäfer , who is unfortunately unable to attend .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0056 / 97 ) by Mrs Waddington , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the Commission &apos;s White Paper on Education and Training - Teaching and Learning - Towards the Learning Society ( COM ( 95 ) 0590 - C4 @-@ 0597 / 95 ) .
What is more , Parliament should set an example to the young people of Europe by reorganizing itself on the lines of a truly federal Europe , in which local and regional bodies have more powers , including the right to group together and negotiate agreements with regions in other Member States .

For obvious ethical reasons there is at present a consensus within the international scientific community on banning research into human cloning .
That is why I am convinced that we need to have a world @-@ wide moratorium on the cloning of animals , and that does not mean I am convinced that there will be no more cloning of animals .
We cannot assume that because we have something under control in the European Union it is universally under control .
Why not the Renaults of this world too ?
That is surely a distortion of competition .
We are debating a key bi @-@ national question .
I would say that there is good point in condemning the action by Renault .
The idea that Europe can counter low labour costs by making the most of its own comparative advantage , new technology , and lax rules with services of high quality , and that upon those foundations a new , modern , dynamic and competitive industry could be built , is precisely the creative idea that the Commission , and the Commissioner honouring us with his presence here today , as well as our common creation , the forum for shipping industries , have been promoting since 1991 with their initiatives .
Mr President , during 1996 the number of newly registered cars within the EU increased by 6.5 percent .
This position says a lot about the underlying implications and intentions of the European Parliament , which , let us not forget , is also calling for new powers in relation to immigration .
Secondly , it is important to create legislation on the media which , by limiting their convergence , will help safeguard and stimulate pluralism of opinion and freedom of expression for all .
It dealt with the various fundamental aspects : conversion policy , policy on technological innovation and social measures ( it appears that in the future social measures are to be reduced merely to the question of training of the workforce ) .
As for the shipbuilding industry , a long time ago the Community introduced legislation to abolish State subsidies , but at the same time it failed to propose alternative solutions , which could have led to development on the basis of private @-@ sector economic criteria for the shipbuilding industry in Europe .
You are familiar with the drama of the Social Charter .
The Culture Committee was extremely aware that there had been a serious lack of focus on the content aspect of the information society and the need to concentrate both on educational and cultural opportunities and obstacles that the information society will throw up .
So we are faced with a number of illusions here .
They are all pending .
However , we believe that it is certainly scientifically difficult to prove that all projects in category 2 are low @-@ risk ones .
Once concerns information to the public .
I would like your position on that too .
At the last meeting of the working group on 24 October last , the Canadian side mentioned that Canada is launching a new aboriginal forestry programme .
Thank you , Mr Van den Broek .
I was of course not proposing that Annex 1 should be removed from the Bird Directive .
This is important because 80 % of the appropriations in the budget are administered in the Member States .
Will Parliament receive a report from the EU special envoy to the Middle East , with particular reference to the special tasks assigned to him in the Dublin Declaration of December 1996 ?
Is the Council prepared to commission an assessment of the impact of ending tax @-@ free sales and is it prepared to postpone implementation of the decision or grant exceptions , e.g. in the case of ferries operating between Member States ?
Subject : New factors in the negotiations on the accession of Cyprus to the EU
She asked about the link between the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference and the start of accession negotiations .
Without such an initiative , for which unanimity is required in the Council , in the absence of an amended Commission proposal , the prospects for a solution are not favourable .
This is proved by the very large number of national and Community inspections that have been carried out on French tuna fishing vessels .
I suggest to the House that the Commission keep itself fully informed of developments relating to the inquiry and that it keeps the Committee on Fisheries fully informed .
And the famous &apos; non &apos; of Sekou Touré was met with a whole lot of reprisals from the French .
What was intended was that a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs should visit Roisín McAliskey .
We would like to see the Commission negotiate with Switzerland to make sure that those safe havens that exist in Switzerland for the criminals and for transfer of ownership of goods should be brought into a control which is sympathetic to the transit system as it is working in the other Community countries and the other members of it .
The Commission is aware of the potential final implications for the operators concerned , however this question can only be resolved by legal means and by checking the merits of each case .
The key recommendations - and I will close on this - in the Committee of Inquiry &apos;s report are really about the nuts , the bolts , the gears and the wheels of the Single Market , and we have got to take note of them and make it work .
No , we did not !
Ladies and gentlemen , the debate on this matter has already taken place , so we will move to the vote .
Out of which quota ?
He had the right to intervene and I regret that he was not facilitated as others were .
So I welcome the report &apos;s emphasis on preventing threats to people and the environment , rather than just limiting them .
Our opinion of this is totally clear : We cannot accept the cloning of either humans or animals .
After all , why are the socialists so vehement about this business unless it is because the Renault management was brought in by a socialist government , because it is made up of socialists , and because it is undertaking - extremely clumsily , I must say - institutional responsibilities entrusted to it ?
I hope that instead it will contribute to an effective industrial and social policy which will make it possible to avoid situations like this , which unfortunately bear witness to the serious crisis through which some sectors of industry are now passing .
I want to put on record here that that decision was taken administratively , and not politically as such an important decision should have been .
But it is also a source of frustration and anger for law @-@ abiding citizens .
The crisis was older than that , the situation was explosive even without it , and we too bear some responsibility .
President Sali Berisha agreed with the opposition on guidelines for a political solution and managed to achieve an agreement on setting up a government of national reconciliation made up of all the political forces and working towards national peace ; at the time , the opening of a dialogue was greeted with shouts of joy and of rage by the rebel towns .
Neighbouring Greece can be sucked into the problem .
Perhaps one of the limitations of the Barcelona Conference is that it demonstrates the absence of a genuine European foreign policy .
I have in my hands the calendar of events produced by the Commission .
The second pillar , or the second part of Barcelona , consists of economic policy and the association agreements .
Are we going to wait until our 18 million fellow citizens who are out of work are called upon to come and demonstrate their discontent in this House to force us to vote under pressure ?
That is one point .
I think a view of Europe firmly based on the tangible , the material , is a legitimate view of the project .
I asked him what the Commission thinks about the Council &apos;s position that anti @-@ discrimination safeguards for the elderly , the handicapped and gays must be covered in the current package of social measures , when I thought the Commission had always said that there was not as yet any legal basis for that .
The problem here is the long @-@ standing and widespread problem of a lack of legal base .
I take this opportunity to say that , once again , I am shocked that the Council is not represented at this debate .
And yet , in this case too , what we have is not expansion but regression : the trade @-@ off is the closure of the Vilvoorde factory , which will probably persuade Europe , through the Structural Funds , to make appropriations in order to compensate for the job losses .
It is more important that it be well spent than that it be all spent .
Second , Amendment No 4 , which seeks to ensure that criteria for deciding a country &apos;s eligibility for EU support and for evaluation of the projects will be defined in dialogue between the Community and partner governments or organizations .
However , I would like to give you an example of something that is being done in the population field , namely the three most recent decisions we have taken under the terms of a bilateral cooperation project , to demonstrate that we are well above ECU 300 million .
The Council must understand once and for all that it is the European Parliament which has the last word on research spending under the budget procedure .
Mr President , I would just like to support what Mr von Habsburg has said .
Since the decision was taken to switch to a market economy and to introduce private enterprise , however , the situation of the Armenian people has steadily improved .
Mr President , we are concerned this morning with the fourth Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the Transcaucasian States .
It was not without reason that , in its resolution of 17 January 1997 , the European Parliament called on Turkey and Azerbaijan to relax their economic blockade on Armenia .
Mr President , I wish to congratulate all the rapporteurs on their excellent reports , which cover interim agreements and partnership and cooperation agreements with the three Transcaucasian states of Armenia , Azerbaijan and Georgia and the Central Asian state of Kazakhstan .
It simply seeks to delete a phrase from this paragraph , the important phrase concerning the establishment of a nuclear @-@ free zone in the Mediterranean region .
I therefore wish to thank Mrs Morgan for her report , which has my full and complete support .
A new policy had to be inaugurated even though the European Community &apos;s Mediterranean policy had already been in existence for 20 years . However , its purely trade @-@ related approach and system of unequal treatment with a basis in colonialism resulted in its failure .
This too is something we have discussed on a number of occasions and are discussing again this afternoon , because we in the House would like to make it clear that we wholeheartedly support the Dalai Lama &apos;s proposal for talks on the future .
The context I refer to comprises , first of all , the texts : UN Resolutions Nos 242 and 338 , which very specifically exclude any further forcible acquisition of territory , together with the European Parliament &apos;s resolutions , especially that of November 1996 , and the Council &apos;s latest declarations .
Kosovo
My group will only be requesting a separate vote on this paragraph because we do not think it is right in terms of the methodology of the resolution .
This racket is also linked to the racket in illegal labour , employed in domestic service , agriculture and construction , but also unfortunately in prostitution .
At the Clinton @-@ Yeltsin summit , far @-@ reaching proposals on the dismantling of strategic nuclear arsenals will be on the agenda .
The only thing both our delegation and ECHO are telling us is that it will be necessary to wait for the waters to recede before a proper evaluation of the situation can be made .
Internally , we are still a long way from sustainable development .
Will the main players be able to get to grips with the practical implications of Agenda 21 ?
The human rights situation in Burma has been of concern to the European Union and the European Parliament for a long time .
First and foremost what I would like to do is to add my congratulations to those of the rest of the House to Mrs Theorin for her excellent report and very sensible amendments to the text .
I refer to the tragic events on the Israeli @-@ Jordanian border yesterday .
Getting back to the idea of reducing production through quality , we need to realize that by 2010 , 5 % of European consumption will come from biological farming - including wine .
It is therefore necessary to guarantee improved visibility of the financial effort .
Therefore we advise that , in addition to all of the conditions and precautions which have been properly introduced by Mr Pompidou and the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , we should add a clause for the respect of trade union rights , since we have seen young children working , we have seen a lack of trade union freedom , we have seen hazardous work and an increase in working accidents in these countries as well as the use of violence - the epidemiologist Jaime Breihl pointed out that one of the most dangerous epidemics in these countries is violence .
Mr President , I would like to thank rapporteur Boogerd @-@ Quaak for an exceptional report and for the excellent co @-@ operation while drawing up the same .
Looking at taxation , we can see that more care will be needed , and that taxes will have to go up if the burden of care is to be a collective responsibility , rather than being left to women .
We must stop Old Europe being converted into a decrepit and regressive Europe and that is the role of the European Parliament .
The Minutes of the sitting of Friday , 14 March have been distributed .
Mr. President , my point concerns the agenda for this week .
Even though the actual number of animals involved in testing for cosmetics is relatively small , our aim , like that of the rapporteur , would be to reduce it to zero .
We have ample opportunities .
For those members who have not been following the issue for quite such a long time , let me begin by saying that this Parliament first requested this in 1993 .
To justify its position , the Commission hid behind the opinions of the scientific committees which , moreover , still leave room for doubts , as the commissioner responsible for consumer affairs had remarked .
This communication will naturally be submitted both to Parliament and to the Council .
It has been said that consumers are to be protected as European citizens ; but even farmers are European citizens , too , and so they too have the right to consideration and - why not ? - protection .
These are things that we must establish a priori , but let us now turn to the specific case of genetically modified maize .
These standards are very often inadequate because they are not based on the lowest common denominator .
However , the Council took over only five , a decision which I find less than satisfactory .
I would like to take this opportunity of assuring the rapporteur that the appearance of arsenic and arsenic compounds on the list will be dealt with as a matter of urgency - this is proposed amendment 5 .
We cannot - and must not - create a separate European Union human rights concept .
We must prevent the development of a hierarchy of people .

There is justifiable criticism in the report of the use of violence , inhuman , cruel or degrading treatment or punishment inflicted on persons on remand by the security forces or the forces of law and order .
The vote will take place today at 12 noon .
We should aim to secure the greatest possible benefit from it , especially given the importance of fighting racism .
Supply @-@ side conditions in the European Union can certainly be improved - from the easing of cumbersome authorization procedures to the urgently needed reduction of taxation on the labour factor .
It is a pleasure to begin by heartily agreeing with my colleague , Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath who reiterated and stressed the concern about over @-@ optimistic ideas becoming the officially accepted norm .
We cannot , therefore , miss out paragraph 39 .
Its possible usefulness in terms of the increased availability of food supplies and a diminution of dependence upon pesticides should be subject to rigorous scrutiny .
All forms of discrimination are on the increase .
The second idea is the need for a common policy for growth .
That is what the whole of your case boils down to .
Now , very briefly , because time is limited , I will say a few words on the second question , that is the creation of jobs : how can we facilitate the creation of jobs in Europe ?
They use whatever is in the Treaty and I feel that they deserve our support .
And to complete what may be called this &apos; methodological &apos; or &apos; introductory &apos; stage , I would say that the Commission starts from the sensible position that competitiveness is not an end in itself , but a means of obtaining better living standards and higher levels of welfare .
I do not know if the Dutch would like the canals of Amsterdam to become open sewers for the sake of competitiveness .
But we must also ask ourselves if this a desirable development .
Can the Commission say whether over the past five years there has been a balance between the controls carried out by product and measure ( for instance , export subsidies , interventions , etc . ) in respect of northern and southern products , and whether or not these controls reveal that only the above @-@ mentioned Mediterranean products are subject to fraud ?
That objective has been achieved .
We do not think the effect of the duties will be to deprive them of their own proper business opportunities .
The proposals that the Commission will make will be based firstly on the conclusions of the cohesion report and secondly on the deliberations of the so @-@ called cohesion forum that is to be held at the end of this month , with input from the European Parliament .
Has such a proposal for beef been put to the executive committee ?
The difficulty is that in Europe today , there is a whole raft of what are known as interbank payment systems .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I hope that my attempts to clarify matters might cause you to reconsider the advisability of those amendments , in particular Nos 17 and 19 , which the Commission does not find acceptable .
We could decide , for example , within this sector and other sectors , that from a particular time onwards a regulation is valid for five years unless it is renewed .
I think this is a very important point to make .
It has been drawn up with no regard for the conditions in the Scandinavian countries .
I would point out that , generally speaking , art galleries should be subject to resale rights in exactly the same way as any other commercial trader in twentieth @-@ century art .
Were I not the rapporteur - and , as the rapporteur , I am the servant of the committee - I would openly say that the decision on Monday night was a daft decision .
And how can it be otherwise , especially now that our Member States face the financial and budgetary problems which are familiar to you all .
In 1992 identified irregularities amounted to ECU 204 million ; in 1995 they were assessed at just over ECU 1.1 billion .
Let me at this point say a word of praise for the Commission , and especially for Mr Liikanen and Mrs Gradin , because I believe that the SEM 2000 initiative launched by them did prompt a change of course by the Council .
I want to reply to some of your comments .
The Council is extremely concerned at the latest developments in the Middle Eastern peace process .
Mr President , at a time when the peace process is in a critical state , victim of premeditated aggression and multiple provocation , we will not dwell here on the opening of a tunnel in the Arab town , the repeated cordoning off which prevents an entire population from moving around , the installation of new extremist colonists , the collective reprisals , the deaths resulting from attacks , and the repression .
But in the end , it is positive that the Council of Ministers has signed it and the European Parliament is unanimously in favour .
This is why we were pleased to see the introduction of this legislation in Sweden on 1st January 1997 .
Commissioner Silguy amplified this disturbing fact by verbally adding that Europe lost 1.5 million jobs at that time .
The General Affairs Council of the European Union on 24 March decided to send a mission to Albania to advise the Albania authorities on humanitarian , economic and political issues and on questions of security .
Madam President , I should like to start by thanking the Commissioner and Mr Patijn for their reports , and emphasize that the liberal group in this House will of course support all the humanitarian aid projects that have been launched , including the deployment of a military protection unit which , sadly , is once again needed in order at least to safeguard the humanitarian aid .
I hope that a new common foreign and security policy will be able to prevent fresh crises , including through the use simple majority voting .
The European Union has no mandate in military matters , has no mandate for defence policy .
Firstly , after 1 July Hong Kong will no longer be a solely British issue , it will become a concern for the whole of the European Union .
But there are worrying signs that both Hong Kong &apos;s economic success and its political and civil freedoms could be put at risk after the hand @-@ over on 1 July .
But , to ensure that we have access to independent results , we commissioned a study from STOA which examined the situation in the most heavily polluted city , Athens , and confirmed Parliament &apos;s views .
Does the Council not consider that the participation of the Turkish Cypriots in the negotiations would put Turkey in a position to dominate the accession procedure at a time of crisis , not only in Cyprus itself but also in relations between Greece and Turkey ?
Has any thought been given to how this can be prevented , so that these workers remain in their own countries and have opportunities for employment there ?
I refer to the answer I gave the first time .
( The sitting was suspended at 7.10 p.m. and resumed at 9 p.m. )
It will push them in a direction which currently their investment managers do not want to take : investment in new technology , investment in new equipment that will keep them ahead of developments in other parts of the world to ensure that they can provide the products required by the global marketplace .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there is a German Christmas carol which begins with the words &apos; Once in every year &apos; .
So we look forward to the Commission &apos;s reply and if the arguments of Mr Alber , Mr Lange and others are right then clearly Mrs Bjerregaard will accept all the amendments put forward by the Parliament because there can be no other alternative .
In the report Parliament criticizes the preparation of the technical basis for the Commission &apos;s proposal , namely the joint programme with the oil industry and car manufacturers , which we refer to as the Auto / Oil Programme .
Madam President , the Commission can accept certain of the amendments which improve the proposal but do not alter the basic approach .
The fact that the European Parliament has approved this report could be decisive for future developments in this situation , either because the Portuguese Parliament decides now to adopt similar legislation or because the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs comes to accept the new proposals and they are required to be incorporated in national legislation .
Amendment No 13 on Article 4 ( 1 ) cannot be accepted because the wording in the Commission &apos;s text derives directly from the case law , in which no distinction has ever been made between indirect and direct discrimination in this respect .
I am pleased about their very positive attitude to this proposal .
For these reasons we will vote against this proposal unless certain amendments which we shall table are taken into account by this Parliament .
Our proposals are not palliatives .
Thank you Madam President .
We regard this as an inadmissible encroachment on future decisions regarding future fleet strengths .

In the specific case we are dealing with today of measures to reduce atmospheric pollution , it must be firmly asserted that the position defended by the European parliament is aimed at protecting the health of our citizens and preventing the continuing increase in the really harmful effects of acid rain , the deterioration of historic monuments and the widespread pollution in our entire ecosystem .
It is also a means of ensuring respect for a principle which is of such great social importance that it transcends the subjective rights and individual interests of those bringing proceedings .
Just look at Mr Lukashenko &apos;s repeated declarations , at the way in which he is dismantling civil liberties bit by bit .
All this is becoming grotesque !
Three women teachers who have stayed to give lessons to children are encountering terrible difficulties , and out of the 20 , 000 people who were living in the enclave in 1974 , only about 450 remain , precisely because of the constant persecution that has gone on .
We have already received a written complaint from the People &apos;s Republic of China &apos;s representative to the European Union .
I call upon the European Parliament this afternoon to join with Amnesty International in recognizing these men as prisoners of conscience and agitating for their immediate release .
Yemen is also committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the region , such as the dispute over an island in the Red Sea or the border problems with the neighbouring State of Saudi Arabia .
Karelia has been affected by the chaos in Russia more than other parts of the country .
We also think that the Commission &apos;s proposal risks placing an unnecessary administrative burden on both professional fishermen and the authorities involved .
Europe - which never had any concerns about education nor any tendency to make things converge , I do not say as regards teaching , but the quality of teaching in which some countries even regard other countries as having a lower teaching standard -must now face , quite naturally , the problem of recognition of diplomas .
In view of the 1999 complete study of the 1992 directive on a second system for the recognition of professional training , the Commission is wanting to propose some amendments and , for example , to include a provision that account must be taken of experience gained subsequent to obtaining the diploma .
Mrs Schmidbauer is quite right : we need a proper legal basis for social programmes , we need a clause on non @-@ discrimination , we need what Mr Schiedermeier emphasized once again - coordination of national policies - and a high @-@ level group of experts would also be extremely helpful .
The European Union , which has 37 million disabled persons , must evolve still further to reach a state of equality for all .
Without human infrastructure , we shall not make any progress .
What is more , the USA is enjoying a game of cat and mouse : it withdraws its appeal to the WTO on cereals and rice , and just as the Commission is about to adopt the regulation on the cumulative recovery system to give it almost complete satisfaction , it again makes the same appeal only a few days later .
There is no explanation why Big Brother World Trade Organization should continue to orchestrate as it does all aspects of piracy .
I should like to reassure Mr Hallam ; over two hours ago I pointed out to members of the staff that the names of my colleagues who , fortunately for me , voted against the Ghilardotti report , are illegible .
This is not an easy task , because do not forget that only 49 % of European women think that Europe is a good thing , against 57 % of men .
Within the framework of these opinions , we must take account of certain criteria which have been set by the European Council of Copenhagen in 1993 .
On the basis of this encouraging observation , the general orientation is aimed , as your Chamber recommended in its Annual Economic Report , at giving new impetus to the economic strategy of the European Union .
In any case , it is not a matter of advocating a general drop in pay .
Illegal and harmful material on the Internet
And there is no need for the government to take over from parents here .
This problem of filling in forms is a vital one .
In fact , craft and small enterprises have accounted for 60 to 80 % of the new jobs created in the past five years .
Firstly , why are small businesses not involved in the social dialogue ?
Turning now to Mr Garosci &apos;s report , I can say that I believe that the 1995 report of the Commission on the coordination of activities in favour of SMEs and the craft sector provides a complete picture of the Community &apos;s horizontal measures for these businesses . This report is an important tool for the coordination of the Community &apos;s activities and programmes .
Furthermore , the European Parliament must accept that it will have the final say on non @-@ compulsory expenditure in Category II and that it should negotiate for all it is worth on Category I. All I have to do now is congratulate Mr Tillich , the rapporteur , once again on his openness to agreement and compromise .
I would ask Mr Kinnock - and I apologise for the lack of notice - briefly to comment on that dispute and to see how we can best work together to ensure the free movement of people and goods in the future .
If we do this we will certainly minimize any kind of risks in the whole question of transporting toxic materials , but particularly , of course , nuclear material .
Liner growth for example has been almost 7 % per annum throughout the world over the past ten years .
It must be possible to distinguish between maximum openness of maritime transport markets and market forces which endanger maritime safety .
UK structural measures
Rapporteurs should be disinterested and Parliament should adopt this principle in future .
This ability for mutual adaptation is what makes the difference between a Europe with a face , a personality , and a Europe which is completely faceless .
Finally , this kind of development would allow the inhabitants of these countries at last , at last indeed , to play an active part in their own development .
For the others , we can find solutions on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis .
In particular of the European Parliament .
The dangers of plutonium cannot be underestimated .
The Commission welcomes the position taken by Parliament &apos;s two committees , the Committee on Energy and the Committee on External Economic Relations . I wish to congratulate Mrs Ahern on her work and , of course , to thank all of the Members who have spoken here this morning .
The framework agreement can also have a positive influence on the process of transition toward parliamentary democracy .
In particular , small and medium @-@ sized enterprises and especially &apos; micro &apos; firms of 10 employees or less are those most at risk from inadvertent or unplanned legislative burdens . Our measure gives those businesses particular protection .
Under the current system , there is no need for a detailed cost @-@ benefit analysis when assessing the impact on businesses .
In principle the Liberal Group believes this is wrong and in practice we will not be a rubber stamp .
( The proposals were ratified )
We think that this problem must be resolved internationally and we welcome existing proposals for an international solution .
Centralised decision making cannot possibly suit all the regions of the EU .
Mr President , the EPP Group is totally in favour of amending the Rules of Procedure to make voting time shorted by no longer holding split votes .
In this context I would remind the House of the Slim report , approved recently , in which Parliament once again complains that too much &apos; soft law &apos; is being enacted .
Madam President , &apos; Europe must do less to do better &apos; .
I do not think this presents major difficulties at all .
We do not share that view and we are perfectly content that there should simply be obligations on Members and not on third parties .
Unfortunately these recommendations are still a dead letter .
We must make sure that the shortcomings revealed by the Committee of Inquiry on BSC should not occur again in the context of organic agriculture .
I believe that this is an extremely important issue , and I hope the House will support our move .
Mr President , I am pleased that today we are able to discuss a proposal in the agriculture sector which for once goes in the right direction .
This also applies in principle to Amendments Nos 97 and 99 , where they bring the provisions of Annex VI into line with the general ban set out in the articles of the regulation .
Finally it is important to stress and reassert the fact that without calling into question the desirable and possible diversification of farming activities , the vital aspects of the future of countryside and rural activity will continue to depend on the direct and permanent development of agriculture and the relevant desire to guarantee future resources destined to improve the social and structural aspects of farming production , making it possible to promote dignified living conditions for all farmers and in particular those who farm in peripheral or under @-@ developed regions .
On the multiannual programmes , you have made a saving of 1 % .
The Commission would very much like to see the proposal finally adopted in June this year .
The Directive essentially has two objectives : 1 ) the harmonization of the internal biocide market and 2 ) a high level of protection for man and the environment .
But it would have been even better if the proposal which was presented in the committee on the Rules of Procedure by my party colleague Mr Metten , of the Netherlands , had also been included .
Within the Member States we could be talking about national , regional or local level .
My three points are as follows .
We should not be surprised , if we open the door so wide , that interpretation varies from one year to the next .
However , the Commission &apos;s communication also deals with how we can ensure positive and active implementation in the Member States .
Any radiation , albeit at low levels , will be harmful .
We must involve all the major players , including my friend Mr Glante from the PSE Group , who helped us bring this matter to a successful conclusion .
This applies in particular to rural and peripheral regions - hence our keen interest in satellite @-@ based communications , as Mr Hoppenstedt has stressed once again .
Is the Commission aware that a Spanish businessman has been detained in the US under the Helms @-@ Burton Act ?
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for this reply which is both practical and sets out some of the priorities .
Mr President , the proposal for a White Paper on voluntary organizations and foundations has been the subject of much deliberation over the past month , both within the European Commission itself and with the associations , bodies and foundations involved .
You will be aware , I know , that I am dealing with a report that is going through Parliament at the moment on services of general interest .
That is for the Swedish Government to decide .
You said , Commissioner , that other transport aid is not out of the question in the region .
It would be tantamount to supplying information to competitors and discouraging technical dynamism ; in this way , the innovative ideas of European SMEs might be taken up by competitors , including those in third countries .
In recent years and months , we have discussed at length the procedures for the recognition of diplomas and certificates of qualification , and I think that a good deal has been achieved in this area .
As the European Union is opening up to new horizons , we must also give this mobility new frontiers .
I must be somewhat less complimentary , however , about the fact that , very often , there is a lack of co @-@ ordination between Community institutions .
For one thing we have an Intergovernmental Conference advancing at a snail &apos;s pace on this chapter , but , most important of all , we are rapidly approaching a NATO summit which is going to widen that organization geographically and strengthen its functions .
No , we have no need for any surveillance or analytical capacity if we then lack the will and the political and military machinery to react .
The benefits of neutrality , which is important to us and which has a long tradition , pale into insignificance behind the great hope and the broad security dimension which the CFSP can provide .
Peacemaking , for instance , is translated as rauhanhieronta which in English means peace massage .
Impetus could be given to the process if Member States were to adopt a joint action on armaments cooperation under Article J.3 of the Maastricht Treaty , and we need more synergy and less duplication in this area .
So we in my group think that the Titley report in response to the Commission communication is an extremely important document .
Mr President , Mr Titley has written an important report .
And where arms and disarmament are concerned , investment necessarily represents the long term .
That is the path chosen by the Barthet @-@ Mayer report and that is why our group supports it .
Now there is also a desire to add to this structure a common policy on the arms industry .
I maintain that these two things are closely interrelated .
So as regards the external side , the law , what is basically being said is that the intelligent use of a weapon like the recommendation allows us , with the immediateness international political problems require , to formulate how foreign policy is debated , and whether there are criteria , opinions , judgements , or guidelines to the Commission .
I will concentrate on what the Commissioner said .
The WTO must amend its rules so as to give a hearing to weaker parties , developing countries and the environmental lobby .
Despite the recent face @-@ to @-@ face meeting between President Mobutu and the ADFL leader Mr Kabila , there are still no real negotiations taking place between the parties to the conflict .
I think that there is a lesson to be drawn .
With such a structure , individual ethnic groups can enjoy a certain measure of independence and , in my view , this is a country which can only be governed securely as a federation .
Does the President @-@ in @-@ Office of the Council not think that the solution might be to create land corridors so that , in case of conflict in a country , it would be possible to travel by these emergency routes and vehicles would not be affected by conflicts in a country which was not their own ?
Subject : The US Helms @-@ Burton Law
We are dealing here with the area of activity of national intelligence and security services .
It does not require a great understanding of economics to see that the cheaper you make it to enter a particular market , the more the capacity will be and the more that supply in terms of capital or vessels and equipment will outstrip the availability of resource .
In accordance with these five principles , we can state that the report considers these guidelines without detriment to the initial perspectives which were diverse and some of the contradictions which still exist .
The same argument applies to consumers , who continue to have access to a market for good quality products at reasonable prices .
I therefore hope that the amendments tabled by the Committee on Fisheries will be approved , to make this report a balanced , realistic one serving the interests of the European Union .
I do not really know how I can overcome that .
Mr President , I refer to page 11 , item 7 of the Minutes - the debate on my report .
Mr Soulier is wrong .
It has not managed to do so in those 40 years .
Why ? Because the costs are huge for the environment , for public health and also for national budgets .
And let me also say that the criticism levelled at the European Commission for attributing particular weight to nuclear energy is unjustified .
Nothing is more basic than food and energy ; and it would capture the public imagination in every single one of our Member States .
Where is the technology we are developing being applied there ?
I declare that I am withdrawing from any vote where I do not know what is being voted upon . I shall therefore withdraw from any vote in connection with the debate on this report .
So there is no reason for the EU to develop a common defence industry as this report proposes .
Because we entrusted our common diplomacy to two Member States , France and Belgium , the Union was committed to the point of blindness to supporting Mobutu - who was held up as a guarantor of stability and territorial integrity in Zaire .
Well , in this situation , what is the significance of suspending the application of the extraterritorial effects of the Helms @-@ Burton Act on Europeans ?
We agreed to suspend the panel , and I repeat , suspend and not disband it .
The people want prosperity and social security , but the massive military investment causes the region many problems .
As against that , as various Members have pointed out , humanitarian aid remains important and is also being continued , especially to the people in the south of the country caught up in the civil war .
The recent UNICEF report also paints a serious picture .
And some firms should be confronted with their responsibility for the trade they organise in our countries .
I do not intend to take up what Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz said , but since I know that the nuclear power stations are often the subject of debate the European Parliament I must say that the Union &apos;s contribution is primarily aimed at making nuclear power stations safe , which would otherwise not happen , and also tackling the problem of proliferation .
Let there be no misunderstanding on the need to make China understand that there is no question of discriminating against Member States of the European Community on human rights policy .
The report hardly mentions the large renewable energy sources in the Scandinavian Countries , for example various forms of bio @-@ energy , the forest , woodchips , pellets , peat and so on . But the report is move in the right direction so I have voted in favour of it .
I am sure that they are going to be raised .
Whereas solar energy could be a solution in one region it is less viable in another , where perhaps water power or bio- energy would be more appropriate .
I say all this because both the time devoted to debating this report , and the time when we are to vote on it , namely tomorrow , Friday , when only 150 members will be here , indicate the level of interest we attribute to it .
I would like confirmation that this was accurate or has Conservative policy on that changed ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission must congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Hendrick , and the Committee draftsmen - Mr Ferri for the Legal Affairs Committee and Mr Whitehead for the Culture Committee - for their excellent work .
These documents have highlighted many important points .
But it is a principle that we mean to defend , trying at the same time to reduce bureaucracy so far as is compatible with the sound and efficient administration of the Funds .
By comparison with other projects , I too would say that interregional and cross @-@ border cooperation has a greater impact on people &apos;s daily lives , one reason being that the projects involved are often born of popular initiatives .
In our opinion it would be a good idea to set up an Interreg D instrument to finance linguistic cooperation in these cross @-@ border regions .
Finally , as regards inter @-@ regional co @-@ operation , the last two calls for proposals , addressed to the territorial entities in conjunction with other bodies operating at territorial level , place the emphasis on the development of partnership , on innovation and on the exchange of knowledge and skills .
They represent approximately 14 million European citizens , that is a population greater than that of certain Member States .
The limited amount of space requires great pains to protect the natural environment and makes these regions susceptible to phenomena such as variations in air and sea transport , an interruption in the supply of essential products , provision of drinking water , water treatment and the management and recycling of solid waste .
I want to the Commissioner to tell us what is happening .
We think that two years is the upper limit and we are prepared to work with the authorities there in order to make sure that all the conditions for free and fair elections are met in due time .
The fact that it is doing this on neighbouring territory is actually only possible because of the unusual situation in Iraq , where the lack of government and central control from Baghdad since the early 1980s when the Iran @-@ Iraq conflict began has made the northern part of the country the only place where this could happen .
I would reiterate just how important it is that we should ultimately reduce the tax burden on the labour factor , because that is the way to increase purchasing power in real terms .
It is only due to this House &apos;s resilience that we are now at a stage where the Commission is recommending that it accepts some of our amendments .
A great deal of time , within the constraints that very busy people always face , was spent discussing the issue of reweighting votes and the qualified majority .
Here are the four points on which we in the Group of the European Liberal , Democratic and Reformist Party will judge whether or not Amsterdam is a success .
It will give us a base to create a citizen &apos;s Europe and it will give a base to prepare for the process of enlargement which is the next big issue on Europe &apos;s agenda .
This House has demonstrated - not least through some very recent decisions - that it is prepared to cooperate constructively on foreign policy .
Mainly services and intellectual property .
But when officials lose their hearing , democracy loses its dignity .
Mr President , I should like to tell the Commissioner that the Greek text referring to that amendment , which I had asked him to accept , uses the expression &apos; unjustifiable pressures &apos; , on the exchange market .
Ultimately it could be said that the whole of the European welfare state model depends on how we succeed in adjusting taxation .
Finally , I am pleased that Tony Blair , Britain &apos;s new Prime Minister , has declared that his presidency of the European Union in 1998 will see the completion of the market as a first target .
I would like to make the most of the time remaining to refute some claims which I think are prejudicial .
It is a rejection of what has so far been an inadequate attempt to harmonize it at European level .
Anyone expressing approval or disapproval will be immediately ejected by the ushers .
I have myself benefited from both of them .
As regards the PPE Group &apos;s amendments to the Crowley report , I would stress that in the case of Amendment No 13 by Mr Mann , the German version is the original .
In Community jurisdiction on a subject concerning personal data , the Court of Justice and Court of First Instance ought to be able to intervene when , for example , citizens are making claims or when a uniform interpretation of the convention is needed .
There are currently four information networks .
Even in the case where the carrier did everything to avoid an accident , there is now to be a strict level of liability and in fact , there are also proposals for advance payments in the case of death .
Will you talk to them as soon as possible and report back to us ?
But we confidently believe that this measure which is simple but important will significantly contribute to safety at sea and we look forward to working with others who share our concern and in particular with Commissioner Kinnock .
This is an unacceptable amendment for us because it automatically binds the Member States , many of which have not yet ratified the STCW Convention .
I am sure we all benefit from the different hours .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Aparicio Sánchez has tabled an amendment that I cannot accept as it deletes the final part of the text .
We must coordinate our legislation in this field in order to put a stop to relocations within the European Union .
We believe that it is the Member States themselves who can best determine taxation policies and we believe that these can be co @-@ ordinated between the Member States by the EU Finance Ministers without relinquishing the principle of unanimity .
The reasons why I supported the adoption of a positive attitude towards the recognition , legitimacy and the regulation of the so @-@ called non @-@ conventional medicine health care sector are various .
The meeting went ahead as scheduled , but even though I wanted to take part and thought that I could make a useful contribution I was unable to do so because I had been informed that there would be no Greek interpretation .
I can suggest two scenarios : either the debate will be held from 9 p.m. to midnight on Tuesday - when he would be present - or we hold a debate with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
In the past year children who have been missing - in some cases for up to 18 months - have been recovered .
The debate is closed .
There is nobody here because those who want to fight and continue to fight the fight for quotas no longer believe in us .
Mr President , the collection and analysis of all health data is obviously a necessary condition for the promotion and actualization of the Community &apos;s competence in the field of health , as required by Article 129 of the Treaty on European Union , and for ensuring that Community programmes and actions in the field are structured in the best possible way .
As draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy , I am going to refer to that subject .
The relationship between noise and health is extremely complex .
At the last plenary I put a question that was not reached and had therefore to be answered in writing .
This work is advanced in all major areas within the competence of the central banks .
It is a shame that there has been so little thought and decisions about this matter since the success or the failure of the single currency will depend on it .
That is over !
In that context , I also welcome the fact that it is clear that the need to consolidate the domestic budgets of the Member States should in no event be at the expense of public investment , and that ought constantly to be emphasized , as this reflects the spirit of the Treaty also .
But Chancellor Kohl insists that EMU must and will go ahead .
We have heard much more recently about economic cooperation , such as at yesterday evening &apos;s ECOFIN meeting in Luxembourg on giving greater priority to the fight against unemployment in Europe .
&apos;Jobs R Us &apos; might be the leitmotif of this debate .
In order to meet that aim , we must assess fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria using the flexibility foreseen in the Treaty and that has to be done at once .
As you know , after the result of the vote on the Randzio @-@ Plath report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on 22 April , nine amendments were presented and if you adopt them they will introduce changes the Commission thinks right .
Did the text adopted by the committee include it or not ?
A shortcoming of the report is its almost complete failure to touch on the issue of boosting employment .
Sweden is a country which has one of the highest levels of value added tax in the EU .
Unfortunately , our financial masters did not back us in their opinion .
And it seems to me that we can only infer from what has already been said that we need to discuss bees , or apiculture will come to nothing .
Throughout the European Union summer @-@ time now stretches from the last Sunday in March to the end of October .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party supports all of the amendments in the report .
This is a sector representing over nine million direct jobs , an average of 5 % of GDP , and one third of the European Union &apos;s service exports .
We are right to recognize the opportunities and the Council &apos;s difficulties .
Mr President , Mr Izquierdo Collado , let me first thank you for agreeing with me that LEADER II is in itself a sound Community initiative .
It is not enough to condemn these acts . We must compensate for the damage done not only to vehicles but also to the goods , because the loss of those goods in particular must be compensated for .
Mr Liikanen wishes to answer you any way . You have the floor , Commissioner .
Secondly , does the Commission envisage in its proposal any reconversion plan as i think that that would be very positive for the French , Irish and British fleets , funded through the IFOP or any other type of European fund so that these fleets could be paid for the additional net investment required and so that they could be given the necessary training to convert to more selective fishing methods .
That is not compatible with the directive .
My question is not the same , because I put it in a European key and with an extremely constructive intention .
It seems that 49 , 143 of our farms receive compensatory payments averaging DM 8 , 595 per year .
We reject these amendments for the reasons already mentioned .
I should also like to thank Mr Baldarelli for the hard work he put in on durum wheat and , particularly for the understanding he showed for the specific problem affecting Portugal - rather a delicate one which he and the Committee on Agriculture have understood .
That is what shocks me .
So the biggest income loss will be borne by the markets that have not been reformed since 1992 rather than by those , such as cereals market , that have been reformed .
Current allowances barely suffice to offset storage costs and interest .
At least that way we would get a budgetary @-@ neutral position .
As for Mr Goepel &apos;s proposal regarding the striking of a balance , that is certainly something that can be discussed .
Everyone knows that genetically produced soya beans or maize , when they are processed , do not have the effects described in the Novel Food Regulation , and need not have those effects , so from that point of view this is a paradigm shift .
Mrs Schleicher , the reason I have been so involved in this issue of the Novel Food Regulation is that I believe that we shall be doing the consumer a disservice if we abandon these labelling principles .
I am satisfied to note the broad support given to a proposal allowing the public to gain access to documents issued by the Council , the Commission and the European Parliament .
I would rather expect them to take advantage of the final negotiations to constitute a coherent and ambitious institutional package .
This is an encouraging sign that shows that flexibility and the defence of workers &apos; legitimate aspirations are far from being mutually exclusive .
For our Group , it is clear that nothing should thwart the process of European integration and the need to take into account social demands and employment should not be a brake on that integration but on the contrary a further argument in favour of strengthening the Union .
And I believe that we , too , in this House will also have to be measured against it .
There is , therefore , a major problem which might not be resolved in Amsterdam and that is why , despite the declarations made by Mr Van Mierlo , I am still wondering about the way in which to react to this situation .
The one , Helmut Kohl , who above all defends the purity of the EMU , a strict stability pact which should make it possible to stimulate employment and growth and , on the other , Lionel Jospin , who says that all that is all very nice but &apos; nonetheless , I would like a practical policy to help the 18.3 million unemployed and 57 million poor people in the Union &apos; .
The European Parliament &apos;s Committee on Budgets has again confirmed that very emphatically .
I shall therefore just make a few general remarks .
However , he said : &apos; I said at the time that the timetable is very tight and we will be examining whether this is possible .
The individual countries will be authorized to regulate certain matters for themselves : wage agreements , culture , education and hospitals - also things that are in ordinary federal state constitutions - media , public service enterprises and freedom of speech .
For any power , but especially for a predominantly civilian superpower such as this Union , foreign policy must be a mixture of trade and economics , of environment and development , of security and human rights .
The measures proposed , as usual , to remedy these gaps are the following : integration of the WEU into the European Union , inclusion in the Community budget of CFSP operational non @-@ compulsory expenditure , enabling the European Parliament to exert controls , and systematic consultation of the European Parliament by the Council before the adoption of common positions .
A clear CFSP line would also facilitate the national debate in neutral States such as Austria .
It is therefore essentially to avoid the undesirable inflation of a blank cheque that I am proposing that the national parliaments should become parties to the European Union &apos;s jurisdictional system , alongside national governments and the Union &apos;s institutions .
We are not a Parliament which just complains , we are also a Parliament which believes it has practical proposals to make on these issues .
So I would just like to take up one additional detail .
This is highly paradoxical since the Chinese authorities are honouring the Sino @-@ British agreements of 1984 , whereas the British authorities have not as they have developed democracy which did not exist before 1984 .
It is small comfort to the unemployed workers in Sweden to know that the Commissioners are studying the problem .
But you must also ensure that they are no longer planted or used .
Secondary aspects are being dealt with and the real crux of the matter is being neglected , namely that of establishing traffic rights beginning , once and for all , with access to third markets , to benefit ordinary people .
No one would dispute that the restructuring of a gigantic empire into a modern state involves many problems , especially in the case of a state which is home to many nations .
I have done so myself at the highest level , mentioning particular cases .
Not only will their security be enhanced but also the security of Europe which makes it extremely important for us all that these countries become members as quickly as possible .
So it is paradoxical that while it has served as the basis for greater equality in other fields and other rights , both social and political , equal pay for equal work is still not properly applied in our countries .
The code of conduct on equal pay for equal work will certainly gain importance thanks to the rewording of Article 119 which finally takes into account the Court of Justice &apos;s case @-@ law and recognizes the right to equal pay for equal work .
I have recently been warned by research scientists in my own constituency who have visited South @-@ East Asia that we are kidding ourselves if we imagine that they are not about to overtake us .
In all these sectors , we call on advanced communications technologies .
I leave it up to the rapporteur to take responsibility for his own personal ideas expressed in the explanatory memorandum .
In January 1997 an attempt was made at a Council meeting to pass a list of countries , including Canada and Russia , when there was no international agreement and these countries had not banned jaw leghold retaining traps , in clear violation of the European legislation .
I am pleased to hear that yesterday the Committee on External Economic Relations adopted an opinion which clearly recommends the approval of this agreement .
Mr McMahon , we are discussing Wednesday &apos;s Minutes .
The EVS cannot take the place of either compulsory military service or national forms of civil service , and the Member States have to bear that in mind .
Give it a name and give it a guiding spirit !
This brochure is being distributed to the Member States and national bodies which can , of course , make local translations and distribute them locally .
This sum , which is much less than the ECU 1005 m initially proposed for 12 Member States , is now woefully inadequate for the present 15 Member States , plus the EFTA countries , the CCEEs and Cyprus , which have been included in the programme .
This means that in vocational training and in businesses we must teach people how to manufacture products , how to supply products and services that consumers will buy .
This , of course , is a problem , not least because of the present budgetary constraints upon the entire Union , ourselves included .
Farmers are expected not to benefit from the introduction of the single currency if ever it happens . That would be especially unfair since they are funding its introduction .
If there were no more bees , most plants would no longer be pollinated .
These microscopic proposals reflect very well the federalist spirit according to which the national parliaments should possess barely more than the right to information or make the odd suggestion when it comes to European matters .
I , at any rate , need have no fear that the strawberries we grow at home will be supplanted by any Spanish or French strawberries , because these strawberries are bought by my consumers and are bought at a fair and reasonable price , and I can tell you , Madam President , that they taste good - I shall bring you one sometime .
Thousands have died . The GDP per head is only 200 dollars , there is 70 % illiteracy , the average life expectancy is only fifty years and a fierce dictatorship , that of Nigeria , is now trying to imposed democracy , paradoxically , in Sierra Leone .
I know also , as does the Commissioner , that the Colombian government must work for human rights .
We are only too aware of the limitations of this agreement , but if the terms to which all the signatories put their names are not respected , it is quite clear that the situation could become inflamed once again .
We welcome the fact that it was possible to reach a joint compromise motion for a resolution which is to be put to the vote .
The debate is closed .
Then we could regulate animal populations and breathe life into this vital convention .
That is why I fully approve of the proposals aimed at increasing spending on the first two years of implementation of the programme and lifting obstacles to the widest possible participation by young people .
Amateur sports clubs do a lot of good voluntary youth work which has a wide range of positive effects on society .
Sport is an international language .
Unfortunately I do not see the same progress being made in these areas as has been made in the area of mineral oil but one can always hope .
Cox report ( A4 @-@ 206 / 97 )
You are going to look into it but I am not sure how if you do not actually know who is here so that you can compare them with who has made an explanation of vote .
We also ask the Council and the Commission to ensure that the necessary transparency and consistency apply in suspension measures vis @-@ à @-@ vis individual ACP countries and that there is equal treatment of the ACP in comparison with the European Union &apos;s other cooperation partners .
There was a tremendous hullabaloo in Scotland about this closure among parliamentarians of all political groups .
In March , we issued an unambiguous position on clones , and now we have the opinion of the group of advisers , and the difference between the two is very striking .
When we start going down that road , do we play games ?
I believe that this is absolutely essential , because our expansion policy and our policy towards Eastern Europe are at risk of coming up against a dead @-@ end , as a result of our selecting , in a most extreme fashion , certain preferred candidates , thereby creating a larger group of wallflowers .
You then say that there are going to be tight enforcement procedures .
In this way , the Council will be able to make recommendations on employment policy .
I look forward to reporting back to you very soon , once the Commission &apos;s services have made progress with this work , and I can assure you that I shall keep you closely informed of the way our ideas are developing on this matter .
I should add , ladies and gentlemen , that the argument along the lines of &apos; hold on , don &apos;t let &apos;s do anything until the fifth directive on worker participation , the tenth directive on cross @-@ border mergers and the draft plan for the European company have been unfrozen &apos; is too reminiscent of the &apos; web of Penelope &apos; , which of course was never finished at all .
And between Scylla and Charybdis a realistic policy must be put into practice as my colleague from the Socialist group , Mr Verdi i Aldea , so rightly said .
That means they must of course ensure that man and the environment are protected .
It would therefore make more sense to label these compounds in all cases with information about constituents hazardous to health or the environment .
Finally , there was the assessment and updating of strategy in the data @-@ processing sector where the Committee on Budgets are collaborating very well with Vice @-@ President Haarder who has responsibility in this area .
When we talk about the European Parliament &apos;s budget , it is impossible not to highlight the fact that the most glaring example of lack of transparency and excessive cost inside this Parliament is represented by the buildings policy in both Brussels and Strasbourg , and it is one of the subjects - this needs to be stressed - on which the Presidency maintains an attitude of extreme reticence every time it is asked .
That means we must work even harder to complete the internal market , which is where the information society has a central role to play .
Mrs Ahlqvist has included most of the points raised by the energy committee .
Well , although the Commission acknowledges the evolutionary and dynamic nature of the universal service , it is still refusing to extend it to include the supply of advanced telecommunication services to educational establishments .
This is in fact the same argument , namely that European technology is trailing helplessly behind the USA , which was used by Mr Servan @-@ Schreiber thirty five years ago when he wrote about the American challenge .
The panel of expert &apos;s preliminary conclusion , and I stress preliminary , was that the EC ban on imports of hormone @-@ treated meat was incompatible with a range of the WTO agreement &apos;s rules on health and plant health measures .
If there is some other culture in America , then let them live with it , we do not want it !
Thirdly , as regards additionality , we are concerned to note that even the Commission itself cannot guarantee the principle of additionality , which worries us because one of the characteristic features of the Structural Funds is the additional nature as a back @-@ up to state and regional efforts thus making sure that it is promoting cohesion .
If there were no criteria for the options , the implementation of the Cohesion Fund itself might actually serve to increase the social and local disparities in the beneficiary Member States .
A further matter that arises is the new assessment system proposed by the Commission , based on the intervention of independent experts .
That is why there are no concrete or official proposals yet at this point .
Perhaps it would be an idea for the Commission to check what happened with the human resources funding in Romania , as part of the PHARE programme .
PHARE is indeed the European Union &apos;s main instrument of cooperation with the Central and Eastern European countries while at the same time representing the most comprehensive international support project for these countries .
On the CFSP budget , I should finally like to say how pleased I am with the interinstitutional agreement concluded with Parliament , and I am most grateful to you , Mr President , and to the Members most involved .
If the Council was really serious about job creation , there is a real opportunity to prove it immediately .
( ES ) Mr President , we thank the Dutch Presidency for the splendid work carried out , but should like to consider the results of the European Council .
But a chapter on employment is not an employment policy by a long way .
Our congratulations go to the presidency on its skilful handling of the matter .
The articles on the right of political asylum might even presuppose a retroactive element , since I do not think it is possible for a Member State of the European Union to be able to grant asylum to a person who has committed a crime in another country and I do not see any sense in invoking political asylum when we are in a Community governed by democratic States .
There are four points I would make here .
The European Parliament will also gain co @-@ decision rights in a significant proportion of EU legislation and will be able to influence the financing of foreign policy .
The European Union Act in 1980 introduced majority decision making on a large scale , particularly in order to promote free movement of goods , labour and capital , which radically restricted the sovereignty of Member States .
We are hesitant about the allocation of money for European Political parties as in some cases they could be seen as a fanciful excuse for increased subsidies and not a requirement of the people .
The first is the underimplementation of the Structural Funds .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have to inform you that Mrs Péry has written to advise me of her resignation as Vice @-@ President with effect from Tuesday 15 July 1997 and as a Member of the European Parliament with effect from Wednesday 16 July 1997 .
I will not dwell on these by mentioning specific practical indications for fuller cooperation and coordination of our activities .
Mr President , I wish to add my congratulations both to the draftsman Mr Papakyriazis and to Mr Söderman , the European Ombudsman .
It is for a period of four years instead of two and extends from 1 May 1997 until 30 April 2001 , and therefore offers increased stability to both parties .
That means she will not be producing any more European Parliament reports and we are losing a colleague who is known for bringing high quality texts before the European Parliament .
Coherence : I like the idea that a large proportion of the money in the Senegal agreement will be spent on development .
And another thing . I have heard it said here that the Senegalese authorities were opposed to this agreement .
One effect of this is that there are constant obstacles to the free movement of services where advertising is concerned .
And in any case , we need to wait for the Amsterdam Treaty to be adopted by the various Member States .
Eighty @-@ three per cent of known genetic diversity and in situ knowledge is held in Africa , Asia and Latin America .
It is for us , for our democratic countries and institutions , to avoid this risk , not through a Luddite approach to scientific discovery , but by ensuring , by means of proper controls , that the ever deeper understanding of the human body is devoted exclusively to combatting physical and mental afflictions .
This obligation underlies amendments 71 to 76 . That is why we tabled them .
I agree with the Committee on Development and Cooperation that patentability of living entities has a negative impact , at both an ethical and a practical level , for the human race , the animal kingdom and the environment .
Patents will establish a monopoly on all uses of genes , including potential future uses .
Madam President , any speech made at this stage of the debate enables one to state , quite simply , &apos; I reject this &apos; and &apos; I support this &apos; .
Madam President , whenever biotechnology is debated , industry repeats the mantra of competitiveness in a manner reminiscent of the medieval church .
Therefore if genetically modified organisms constitute part of a product or if they are used to produce it , this information absolutely must be included in product labelling , and clear , comprehensible and uniform labelling must be introduced .
That should reveal whether a so @-@ called simplified procedure is needed at all .
These types of controls should enable bona fide businesses to develop and eliminate less scrupulous operators .
In my report , I propose that countries which have not introduced number portability by 1 January 2000 should be regarded as countries where full competition on the telecommunications market has not yet been achieved , so that the public are regularly made aware that their country is not yet geared up and that consumers are therefore paying too much .
Research and technological development can make a significant contribution here , and investment in research by those involved in the market could help to promote the development of software and hardware which would quickly make a user @-@ friendly numbering plan available for consumers .
Our country is remote , but we still are not making any progress towards attaining democracy in the new networks , and we need it .
But before we approve those higher speeds , we need to understand what the full implications are : it would be inappropriate for us simply to assume that everything will be fine .
I ask the House to approve the report as tabled , thereby giving the delegation of the European Parliament a mandate to negotiate a fair and balanced budget for 1998 .
Knowing the problems of the countryside , and more specifically the problems of farming , I can only deplore this token 0.45 % increase allowed for in the 1998 budget and seeing this budget shorn of some 2.4 billion with respect to the guidelines laid down in the Edinburgh compromise .
We farmers cannot accept that .
We clearly have free movement of the first three , but the free movement of people , particularly legal residents of the European Union who are third @-@ country nationals , who comprise a population twice that of Belgium , is actually being impeded by the Belgian authorities in a way that I consider to be completely unacceptable .
To avoid any misunderstanding , I just said that we have been able to trace the full quantity related to the 1 , 650 , but I cannot say if this is the total fraud or if there are other amounts , because the inquiry is continuing .
The Commission was also instrumental in bringing about the resolution on coherence adopted by the Development Council on 5 June last in which peace building and conflict prevention feature as a specific theme .
I do not have your figures to hand at the moment , but if I remember rightly we have completed about 6 % of the whole initiative .
The reinforcement of the Commission &apos;s executive powers will help cut delays in resolving the problems .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , like the rapporteur , the Group of the European People &apos;s Party sees the Council &apos;s position as an important step - although not the final one - in the process of liberalizing international transport .
I wish in particular to say that as far as the assessment of the proposal that has been submitted by the Commission is concerned , we welcomed the introduction of the possibility of an external cost element in the tolls and user charges , and in fact we considered it necessary to improve and clarify those aspects further on the basis of proposals and amendments .
It is the only type of solution that will work .
Madam President , I asked for the floor because I wished to respond first of all to Mr Wijsenbeek , whose speech was extremely clever , even though wide of the mark .
I am also worried that the obsession with reducing costs is forcing pilots to work longer and longer hours .
It costs the airlines between ECU 25 000 and 80 000 per day when aircraft are out of service .
The Commission proposal also places more stringent demands on drivers . For example , they must be honest .
I set out arguments that are given in the Minutes , page 5 .
It will be up to the European Council of course to take the decision on the opening of accession negotiations .
( Applause ) For the remaining four states , and others , special arrangements are to be made by this European conference .
All of my colleagues in the UPE Group , like myself , will never resign ourselves to abandoning our friends in Slovakia , Romania , Bulgaria , Lithuania and Latvia .
Mr President , I absolutely agree with what my co @-@ chairman , Mr Pasty , said a few moments ago , and I want to be just as firm in what I have to say about the future reform of the Structural Funds and the proposals today put forward by the Commission .
It will be difficult to explain to many national parliaments , particularly in the cohesion countries , how this enlargement process is going to be financed .
This is something we cannot explain to the public , and we must move swiftly to put it right , otherwise we shall lose their support .
That goes to show that since Maastricht , nothing has changed .
We would stress that the proposal for a directive is designed to eliminate the current legal uncertainty and prevent the risk of fragmentation resulting from the possibility of the national courts taking different decisions on issues of fundamental importance , on the basis of differing national legislation .
On the previous occasion when this Parliament rejected the original proposals before us we had ethical concerns as regards patenting parts of the human body and the practical concern that farmers might be prevented from using seed produced on their own farms .
Today &apos;s decision is not only demeaning , forcing us into decisions already taken in other countries , it also involves huge risks for biodiversity , for environmental balances , for the freedom of medical research and the protection of the sick , and it heralds events unacceptable to human integrity such as , for example , exchanges of genes , the formation of cellular hybrids made up of man and animals and the creation of genetic weapons .
The supporters of this patent law are , with this Directive , dismantling fundamental ethical limitations to the human profit motive and are granting individual economic interests virtually totalitarian claim on the fundamental elements of all life .
Mr President , it has been said that the Intergovernmental Conference was called to prepare the EU for enlargement .
And for that , we particularly need the social partners .
Cyprus needs , at last , to look forward to some prospect of a solution .
We understand that this document will be finalized in the near future , and its annex will indicate what sectoral strategies have to be pursued in the areas of social provision , transport and government administration , and what the needs are for technical and financial assistance .
I wonder if that same understanding would have been forthcoming had it been the opposite party that had emerged victorious !
Following the recent elections in the UK and France , has the Council changed its position on a joint boycott of trade with Burma ?
In doing so both parties have ensured that the various sectors which are the subject of liberalization have been treated in a comprehensive way .
I would like to draw the presidency &apos;s attention to the fact that the massacre is particularly serious because it included women and children .
As far as the commitology was concerned , we wanted to reintroduce the Management Committee in place of the Regulatory Committee .
The question is : will the present Labour MEPs be re @-@ used , recycled or , as I suspect , treated as inert waste for landfill ?
At all events , that is what I understood from the debate yesterday morning on proposal 90 / 220 , in which Mr Bowe stressed very clearly Parliament &apos;s interest in this matter .
It is directly related to the environment and the health of all our planet &apos;s citizens , not just that of the Union &apos;s citizens .
If the country says &apos; yes &apos; it will be possible .
Environmental agreements are no substitute for legislation - I agree with you there -but they can be an outstanding complement to it , and increase willingness to do more to protect the environment without introducing compulsion .
The next item is the debate on the statement by the Commission on the UNGASS Planet Earth summit in New York .
But let us not lose heart .
This report is drafted in extremely clear terms and presents , in the context of decentralized cooperation , the problems there have been regarding conflicts of interests , defects in the Regulation relating to tenders and the lack of a legal basis in the case of some decisions .
It is true that the Commission did not , and still does not , have the resources for the correct management of the financing of the MED operations initiated in July 1992 .
Indeed , this idea of setting up networks putting civil societies and individual operators in contact horizontally , without passing through the red tape of vertical cooperation , has represented a fundamental change , and as such it should be safeguarded .
He suggested that I said that the Court of Auditors stopped these contracts .
Opinions differ within the Socialist Group , but we do agree on the fact that the Commission is giving good advice in this communication .
Alternative crops are not an option in every case .
By simply creating new posts there is a risk that EU bureaucracy will continue to proliferate .
The proposal is that differentiation should be introduced , as a function of the degree of infrastructural damage attributable to the vehicles , and the pollution they create .
on the Rosado Fernandes report ( A4 @-@ 0214 / 97 )
Mr President , two years ago I participated in the EP delegation to Cambodia .
The Commission considers that the arrest of war criminals in former Yugoslavia is an essential element of the conditionality attached to the development of relations between the European Community and the signatory parties to the Dayton Peace Agreement .
O &apos;Dell must constitute a precedent , the nth precedent for modifying the still violent culture of a great country such as the United States .
Peru is making enormous efforts to shake off the bad reputation that originated in its terroristovershadowed past , and I believe that at the present time we would be well advised not only to criticise - sometimes that is necessary - but also to encourage and to support .
That in itself would be enough to prevent us voting for this motion , but also , and more importantly , our refusal to join in the criticism of Tunisia is inspired by the fact that there are many other charges that could be laid or condemnations uttered against a certain neighbouring country in the Maghreb , the tragic destiny of which is causing us such concern today .
In many countries of the world , even if the political conditions can be achieved to bring conflicts to a close , the presence of thousands of landmines prevents the return to conditions of security and development for millions of people .
It should not happen , because that is what leads to such disasters , and therefore the Commission should not pay out a penny for concreting river banks , for example the R. Havel in Brandenburg , in the context of the trans @-@ European river network scheme .
The European Union should contribute to the establishment of international standards for aeronautical products .
In order to explain our positions , we propose that in Amendment No 3 , Parliament should expressly refer to the Reding Report of May 1994 .
The creation of an ideas bank by the countries and the labour market partners before the conference in Luxembourg could prove to be a way of producing a number of good proposals to resolve our biggest problem .
Sir , I have one question . Is there a definite date ?
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0230 / 97 ) by Mr Colom I Naval , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the Commission document ( C4 @-@ 0246 / 97 ) on financial control of Structural Funds operations - net financial corrections .
( The sitting was closed at 7.55 p.m. )
Farmers will , of course , retain the option of setting aside some of their land on a voluntary basis .
I therefore hope , Commissioner , that you will take on board both the explanatory statement and the resolution on which we shall shortly be voting .
These are national matters .
An overall concept of integration , for example with regard to lesser @-@ used languages , also means taking into account those such as Romany , the language of the Roma and Sinti , which is spoken in many EU countries .
I believe that education is the prime basis for employment .
In conclusion , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I welcome this balanced report which , although it emphasizes the responsibilities incumbent upon the Commission , is also incisive in dealing with the responsibilities of the French Government and its administration , which , in my view , are considerably more influential with regard to the difficulties to which I have referred .
I endorse the request by the Committee on Budgets , and would ask colleagues to vote in favour of the report when the time comes .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
We should maintain the agenda as far as possible .
Advertising which makes a real comparison between real qualities in an objective way serves the interests of the consumer , and it should be seen as such .
What a programme for so little money !
This means any representative of a regional or folk culture can happily support this programme .
The report is positive too .
Once again my thanks to the Parliament . I should like your understanding for the fact that neither Mr Oreja nor my female colleague could be here today .
In my view the legal basis for all future legal statutes aimed at liberalisation of the postal market should be article 100 .
Nevertheless I have accepted it , but not because I am not an elected member - that is not the problem ; even having once been a postman does not necessarily ensure better more detailed knowledge .
A common complaint is that it is hard , not to say impossible , to find qualified women for expert bodies .
This debate is crucial , but we do not make the newspaper headlines .
Mr President , I am ashamed that I will not be able to quote Voltaire and Proust as Mrs Lulling has so eruditely done .
Women who have suffered violence - and a majority suffer in silence - and their children need to have the confidence to report attacks , secure in the knowledge that they will be provided with effective support .
It is estimated that one woman is beaten every ten seconds in western countries .
As early as 1986 Parliament took up the question of women and violence in a special report .
The non @-@ discrimination clause in the Amsterdam Treaty will present us with a further need to act .
This is not yet the case when it comes to images of women - as we have heard - in advertising and the mass media in general .
In the first instance , this is a matter of a gradual and controlled approach towards the liberalization of postal services .
The Danish Social Democrats are voting for the Lenz report on their own initiative .
Last night I had a discussion with Parliament &apos;s Bureau and we concluded the modalities by which that will happen .
I am not even sure if the item involved merits a trade agreement .
They said to us that they accept that liberalization and globalization are inevitable in the future .
They said very glibly &apos; textiles is the answer &apos; , but it has to be pointed out that the US is one of the most protectionist countries in textiles in the world .
That is the essential point , Mr Commissioner .
It is a matter which interests and concerns us , and which we want to get right .
Mr President , I shall also be brief , as these decisions were taken some time ago already , and as the honourable member knows , these are cases that have been with us for years .
I understand , for example , that around half of the amphetamines which are seized in Stockholm now come from Poland .
As animal protection is not an express part of the Treaty of Rome or other agreements , the Commission can only repeat its earlier advice to the governments of Member States to do all in their power to bring to an end all unacceptable practices where animals are killed during cultural and sporting events .
The future of agriculture must be secured throughout Europe , and the reform proposals should , amongst other things , help to clarify what we can secure this future with .
As an alternative , Austria supported , amongst other measures , the modernization of existing calorific power stations .
We are also of the opinion that high environmental standards will give rise to innovation in the area of new technologies to the great benefit of mankind .
The Commission is sensitive to the rapporteur &apos;s recommendation , which invites the Commission to set up priorities on four points .
The profits which can be made from this are thought to be up to around 300 per cent , and around 10 , 000 tonnes of illegal freons are said to be imported into the European Union each year .
Anyway , as regards this Helms @-@ Burton Act proposal , it is absolutely clear that the European Union has right on its side , but it has nevertheless sought an amicable solution for the time being .
The consequence has been that the President of the United States has suspended Title 3 , the most damaging title of this legislation , and that since the understanding there has been no action under Title 4 .
We will clarify that point . We will see .
So , within this framework , what are the powers of Parliament ?
I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure .
This understanding of the law was confirmed as recently as 1996 , by the common position of the Council on this matter .
I believe that this last point is very important , and I am delighted at the statement by the President of the Council .
That is an absolute fact .
In this respect , I want to support Mr Marín &apos;s proposal .
I am quite certain , and perhaps the Commission would want to comment on this , that from the point of view of the consumer , mobile telephones and fixed @-@ point telephones , will very soon be virtually one market .
( The sitting was suspended at 12.50 p.m. and resumed at 3.00 p.m. )
As Mrs Flemming mentions , it is most important that the projects should involve education , and that environmental education should be included in general education .
Therefore the proposal is also a concrete expression of the Commission &apos;s appreciation of the contribution of these NGOs to the improvement of the environment .
The Fitzsimons report underlines the importance of monitoring these emissions in order to assess the progress achieved on European standards .
It is in the European Union &apos;s interests for Japan to be a factor for political stability in its region and in the world , to support the multilateral free trade system , to encourage democracy and greater respect for human rights in Asia .
It has not been dramatic because it has not been achieved by any single leap or single agreement but it has been the most substantial because we have moved from a time when , as has been said , relations - largely trade relations - have been contentious to a time when trade relations have greatly improved and when relations have been considerably broadened to cover political activities as well as economic activities .
I think we should leave well alone for the time being . We shall correct the impression which might lead to a false interpretation , and anyway we shall have an opportunity in at most two years to have look for ourselves how matters have developed .
The practical implications of the article are disputed .
Subject : The situation in Burma
There will be a referendum in Wales tomorrow when the people will have a chance to decide to set up their own Assembly .
There are large chains of department stores , there are chains of retail stores , there are franchise chains and self @-@ employed entrepreneurs who keep going through outstanding quality and specialities and which sometimes join forces , for example in purchasing cooperatives .
Of course I support the Commission in its efforts to achieve more environmentally @-@ friendly products and packaging . But environmental interests also demand that we encourage the consumer to recycle and repair goods .
In the opinions that you have put forward you have also quite rightly stressed the importance of organization .
Mr President , the people of Europe are hampered by many frustrations in these matters .
After the agreement signed during the Treaty of Amsterdam , the Council should be able to settle this issue quickly by drawing on the Amsterdam compromise , but the urgency of enforcing this convention for the Union must not be undermined on any grounds , not even by invoking the role of the Court of Justice .
Views and intentions are formulated in the resolution on the agenda , for which I have great sympathy .
The first is that what small and medium @-@ sized and craft enterprises primarily need is not so much incentives of the traditional kind , as a favourable context for their establishment and development .
They must be reassured that all the necessary measures really are in place to ensure that they are buying good wholesome food .
You did not realise what was taking place just now , because you have only just taken over the Chair .
It is of great importance that environmental organisations are given the opportunity to participate in this environmental work which is so important to us .
I have voted against it , because this was not a clear statement and it was not representative of Parliament &apos;s purpose .
Mr Garosci is right to ask for the burden of unnecessary regulations to be lifted from small retailers especially .
Ladies and gentlemen , are you not aware that in occupied Cyprus there has been a Turkish army of occupation for twenty three years ?
Mr President .
I am grateful to the Commissioner for having met me and a colleague this morning to talk about this situation .
The determination of Colombian society cannot be frustrated .
Madam President , according to my information there are different designations of the item in individual versions . That which appears in the German version as recital C appears in an English version as recital D. That will be amended .
As has already been said , the last day or days in Oslo have proved to be a success .
Actually , it is not a question of whether there are enough organisations , enough agencies , or even enough sources of funding .
The beef question is a typical example of a problem which gets harder to solve the further you get from the original source .
Prices have collapsed , beef surpluses have had to be removed from the market by intervention .
The introduction of labelling concerns not just the industry , but also farms , although farmers do not get repaid a penny for their efforts .
Fluctuations in exchange rates add a further hazard in terms of forward planning .
This Christian Democratic Party has supported a policy here , and not only here , but in the national Parliament , which is heading in precisely the opposite direction : the destruction of those farms which you warn us we shall need .
Mr Fabre @-@ Aubrespy , you must not mix up different issues .
Given that , and thanks to better circumstances as well , we should be able to see an improvement in the employment level from 60 to 65 % in five years time and a decrease in unemployment levels from nearly 11 % to 7 % .
Regarding your second question about whether the Council will follow our lead , my answer is that we hope so .
Those who opt to work reduced hours should not be penalized in terms of career advancement .
Thirdly , last year we rightly focussed our attention on the transeuropean networks in the field of transport , energy and telecommunications .
A whole range of ideas have been put forward by Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Tillich in their resolution about the underutilization of credits .
The implementation of the budget is gradually getting better and better , but we should not content ourselves with that .
The Japanese Yakuza are not just active in Tokyo , but also in Düsseldorf and Toronto .
In the strictly commercial sector , it is important that a small number of extremely powerful economic interests , such as those connected with steel , wheat , beef and the audio @-@ visual industry , should not predominate , nor cause us to overlook - or even cause us to consider as less important or marginal - the need to achieve by consensus mutually acceptable solutions to problems which are socially and economically relevant for certain regions and countries of the European Union which , by coincidence , belong to less developed areas , and where , furthermore , solidarity is far from being a reality .
We have our own Rhineland model .
On behalf of the Liberal Group , I should like to make a few things clear .
But I do hope at least that one subject dealt with by this employment summit will be the need to change our economic and labour law structures and make them more flexible .
Member States therefore have a sufficient time lapse in which to prepare for the necessary changes .
International law , Community law , national constitutional law
It must have been a preliminary exercise for his appointment as Advocate @-@ General and I must say that now that he is going to join the ranks of the Court of Justice together with our former colleague Mr La Pergola , we do not need to waste too many more words on the right of appointment of the European Parliament of members and prosecutors at the Court of Justice , because soon the government judges will also become this Parliament &apos;s judges .
We can therefore conclude right away that the rapporteur has covered a number of subjects that concern the very heart of the Community system of law .
Clearly if we are to develop a genuine dialogue between Europe and ASEAN , we must involve directly elected members who have a mandate and we must facilitate contacts as part of the ASEM process and wider EU @-@ ASEAN relations .
It is not liberalism at any cost which reigns there , Mr Telkämper , it is just liberalism , an economic system which is causing deadlock in human rights , in democracy , and which claims , in the name of the market and growth , to forget that human rights are a universal value , to forget about political democracy , and to think that the model of the state can function without these values .
El Niño and the slash @-@ and @-@ burn forestry clearance policies of Indonesia are a devastating cocktail .
Mr President , as a Czech Bishop from Northern Bohemia used to say , to love one &apos;s neighbour would be a wonderful thing , if only the neighbour did not live so terribly close !
I should also like to thank the chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , Mr Rocard and all my colleagues .
On this basis , we must set out to reorganize ACP @-@ European Union cooperation within the framework of a responsible partnership .
Decentralized cooperation gives a human dimension to relations between the European Union and the ACP countries , without which it would not achieve its objectives as outlined in Mr Martens excellent report .
The first one is on staging points , and in the meantime a lot of hard work has been done - this directive already exists - and secondly on the criteria which the means of transport must meet if animals are to be on the road for more than eight hours .
As long as we do not realise that animals are not goods , maintained just for our profit , nothing will change here .
Let me point out that in Austria at the moment the Independent Party is doing lot on behalf of animals who suffer as a result of live transport .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
It is not up to the EU to determine which countries in this region may or may not accede to ASEAN , however much trouble we have with the situation in some countries in the region .
Consequently , I am voting against the Willockx report .
It is far removed from how we believe we can and ought to treat other creatures .
In conclusion , I would suggest that simply tinkering around the edges of the problem will not end the inherent cruelty in long @-@ distance live transports .
We are sure , Mr President , that you will do your utmost to protect the honour of this House and its Members , especially those who - like the people in question - are highly responsible in their work .
This decision is extremely clear and it happens to be the case that in our system we may be condemned by virtue of a decision of a court and that , naturally , the practical consequences of this may be slightly painful .
Nor is it relevant to my argument that Mr Ribeiro Campos may have a private interest in proving that there is substance in what he said , and that there really was a case of corruption .
I believe these to be important steps towards improving Europe &apos;s competence in this area .
A special new Internet channel , the European tourism channel , brings tourist information systems into the home and therefore provides a revolutionary new route for efficient tourism marketing .
We also approved an additional ECU 35 million for BSE research - a real success in my opinion .
This is madness !
Problems must be resolved in order to provide a certain stability for commercial and industrial relations , and investment . This stability can only be achieved by finding a solution - either good or bad .
It must be for the benefit of Europe &apos;s population and protect firms against non @-@ EU countries .
Mrs Ewing , it was an internal matter , that is why it is not there .
I feel that now we at last have the possibility for developing such a strategy , moving from statements of intent to action .
It has been known for a long time that a European company statute would considerably increase transfrontier activity and substantially reduce legal costs .
I do not find this aspect in the report by Mr van Velzen .
50 % of the 20 million unemployed Europeans - and not 18 million - have been without work for a year , 30 % of them for two years .
It remains to be seen whether Amsterdam will give the EU in Luxembourg a new impetus and , more importantly , whether Europe can maintain its credibility and fulfil the hopes of its citizens .
Three participants have an important role to play in tackling this problem : the European Union , which has to provide the impetus , the Member States , which have to draw up their annual action plans , and the social partners , which have to assume their responsibilities .
Secondly , we need more jobs for women .
I also welcome the proposed measures for greater workplace adaptability and more flexible working hours .
There is something different now compared to what was in place heretofore . The difference is exactly what the President @-@ in @-@ Office referred to : the change because of the Amsterdam Treaty and the fact that employment is now a matter of common concern and has moved centre @-@ stage .
It is necessary , and I have asked Mrs van Putten , rapporteur on this subject for the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , to do what is necessary quickly .
In this context it should not be forgotten that employment policy has to be directed at national level .
The Council should be aware of the fact that a new level of cooperation now exists between the two bodies responsible for budgetary matters .
We have to do that and at the same time dispose of our surplus property . That is a major objective of this budget .
I believe that it is right to have a green structural policy , and in the years to come the agricultural policy should also be made green .
It is undoubtedly this cooperation which will enable some substance to be given to the employment initiative at the European Council of Luxembourg which is dedicated to this issue .
In the first place , because we consider that the fight against unemployment and the creation of jobs must immediately be set free from the present restrictive policies .
Thirdly , we have undertaken to prove that we have indeed made preparations to enlarge the Union .
Mr President , the draft general budget which has been presented is relatively restrictive .
We are already a partner to the GPA Agreement and the WTO .
But I would like to draw your attention to the ecological and social criteria which inevitably have to be given consideration when undertaking public procurement .
Even if this method is not the best , the important thing is that it applies to everyone equally .
Mr Bösch , who is to be congratulated for producing such an excellent report , is quite right in urging greater cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament in a number of key areas , and particularly in one which is of great interest to our peoples - namely , what is really happening with Europe &apos;s money and is it being used to best effect .
A decision on this will be taken by qualified majority voting in the Council , and Parliament will be fully involved .
Subject : Cancellation of CMAF Funding
As the author is not present , Question No 41 falls .
Subject : Natura 2000 and military zones
I read in some of the Commission &apos;s documentation that it issued a public invitation to tender and selected a professional communication agency with offices in nearly all the Member States .
On page 7 , where the report mentions frontiers , it says that it is planned to complete the construction of terminals for heavy vehicles using Phare and other structures .
I am concerned not to generate a sense of weariness in those kind enough to listen to me this second time round , and I shall be brief , something which I am not , incidentally , accustomed to .
When my father was born in 1924 , he too was in the post war generation .
But this is likely to cause conflict between the bank and national governments .
Mr President , the first two priorities of the Council and the Commission for the year to come , namely employment and the euro , appear to be fairly broadly contradictory .
Europa must exist . The perception of what we have in common , rather than what divides us ; the meeting of equals , rather than the separation ; the demolishing of barriers which keep us apart .
It behoves you to ensure that the institution is respected from without .
There is wide consensus between original vehicle manufacturers and the spare parts market in Britain that this clause is an acceptable compromise .
The Community action is also of course aimed at the rights of displaced persons in the various Member States - which have up to now all had different rules , nationally orientated - with a view to harmonizing rights throughout Europe .
Secondly it is again stated that temporary protection is an instrument that does not replace or supplement the refugee convention .
Mr President , firstly let me congratulate Mr Wiebenga on his critical comments on the proposal for a Community action for the temporary protection of displaced persons .
I wanted to put a question to the Commissioner , however , and that is why I rose to speak .
A good policy needs to be followed up , we must be courageous enough to face the consequences of our voting behaviour and if necessary laws must then be amended in the light of the results .
It is a shame , from this point of view , that the Commissioner responsible should not be present , even if I am happy to see you among our number .
The European Parliament must insist on clear designation .
We will lose the quality of our chocolate , and we will have to cope with the financial deficits arising from our own shameless attitude with regard to those who put their trust in us .
Of course it is our task to protect European consumers adequately , and to ensure that products can be designated .
Thank you , Mr Wohlfart .

Question No 9 by Sören Wibe ( H @-@ 0704 / 97 ) :
Subject : Nicaragua , the national forum and the national dialogue
Otherwise we should have the grotesque situation whereby the same insurance company which had industrial participation , could continue to use these particular capital resources within the solo supervision system , but these means would cease being capital resources the moment it took on supervised insurance subsidiary companies .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , as the rapporteur rightly said , the Green Paper on copyright and related rights in the information society is a Commission document which seeks to discuss what sort of legal treatment should be given to copyright in a dynamic environment characterized by technological development which makes possible both new forms of reproduction and new means of expression for intellectual works .
The Commission is bound to give reasons why things are technically necessary , but it has not done this in all cases .
We never received a clear answer to that in the Committee on Environment and I should like to get one now .
Parliament is very moderate . Really .
Approval of the Minutes
Madam President , I have no intention of opening a debate on the amendment .
By having an opinion on the preliminary draft budget ready on time it was possible to have a sensible dialogue before the Council established the draft budget .
If vegetable fats must be accepted with a ceiling of 5 % , this possibility should only be offered when it is possible to measure the quantity of them precisely .
The Lomé Convention , one of the principal purposes of which is to promote the exports of these countries , would be quite simply violated .
This situation raises a new and very difficult problem , about which , let us emphasize , we are not at present under any international obligation .
This does not really have anything to do with Islam , it is simply an unprecedented abuse of power by the Taliban .
As for long term aid , it will also be necessary to make this dependent upon real improvements within the country .
This delegation arrived on 24 August and was forced to leave Kinshasa again on 3 October .
Mr President , when I met the new Chief Executive of Hong Kong , Tung Chee @-@ hwa , earlier this week , I raised a number of concerns relating to recent developments there which do not augur well for the protection of human rights .
I do not think that is what we mean by legal proceedings .
But as far as Algeria is concerned , a new factor has appeared .
Areas greater than any of the largest Member States of the Union are on fire .
There is no holy introit as exalting as the preamble to the entry of a European country into the single currency !
We who make the legislation are fighting a continuous battle to keep up with new products which are introduced onto the market .
However , this decision did not mention the tunnel project specifically , and no payment for the work on the tunnel was made .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that in my report by the Committee on Culture on Agenda 2000 , particular mention was made of the necessity to train journalists in the new Member States .
Evidence of this is the decline in circulation of daily papers in the European Union .
Madam President , I wish to speak simply to express the full consent of the socialist group to the report presented by Mr Whitehead just now .
I believe that a regulation at European level is relevant here , even though I do see difficulties in establishing common European values .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9.00 a.m .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for a thorough report in an important area .
In conclusion I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Anttila on her particularly effective work .
In other words , we should bear this in mind and not lump everything into one category . We must continue to encourage slaughter and breeding animals , so that they can reach these markets .
Subsidies could be automatically increased according to the additional costs , but they are set in accordance with the current market situation and to that extent already take account of the exporter &apos;s situation .
Now the measures also include pears .
This regulation might not come into effect until mid @-@ January , when much of the winter , the period which is particularly suitable for grubbing up , will already be over .
Let us trust in the good sense of our farmers .
I ask you to send a message , on behalf of Parliament , and on behalf of all Members present , to the families of the victims , the population of Ribeira Quente , and the local , regional and national authorities , expressing our profound condolences to them all , without exception .
However , I would go even further .
One could give several answers .
So , I would say to her that whilst I am aware of the provisions of article 30 and article 5 of the Treaty on Union , the fact is - and it is an undisputable fact of law - that if a Member State is striving by all practical means to uphold its duty to maintain the freedom of movement within the single market , there is a very constrained power on the Commission to intervene .
Firstly , what measures has the Commission proposed , what can I add as rapporteur for this Parliament and what critical or positive contributions can I bring together ?
The organizers of these trips frequently have links with international criminal networks , and their customers hide behind the pretext that children in Thailand , Cuba or Brazil are more sexually mature than European children . But children are children - and need protection - wherever they are in the world .
First , Mr Wathelet , whom no @-@ one is accusing of being guilty , but who is unanimously regarded as responsible by the parliament of the Member State of which he is a national .
Yes to the strict medical and social monitoring of perpetrators of sexual crimes and the prolonged detention or permanent internment of recidivists .
The report we are discussing is now taking up those calls which have been made for so many years by associations like ECPAT and other women &apos;s groups for better protection of victims and the appropriately severe punishment of offenders .
This detailed and serious forecast by Parliament takes account of some important principles which were emphasized in the document : first , the principle of relative stability which was established when two important countries , Spain and Portugal , joined the Union ; secondly , the principle of maintaining fish stocks at an environmentally compatible level , bearing in mind that in this regard it is not only up to the European Union , that is , the Community institutions - Parliament , Commission and Council - to intervene but it is also up to all the international organizations to order the structures and efforts of the fisheries sector .
We must resist those siren voices and we must resist this report .
We should congratulate her .
Having said that , it should be noted that as a whole the common position adopted by the Council is unfortunately a long way from the European Parliament &apos;s position , and the Commission &apos;s position , as amended , after the vote on this directive at first reading in this House , mainly because there were many essential points where it did not even accept the Commission &apos;s original position .
Then of the 11 amendments which the Commission approved , it only accepted two .
Finally , Mr President , I wish to say that the Socialist Group fully supports this report .
We do , however , wish to maintain the flexibility to put in funds where they are needed in order not to grant any particular country preferential treatment .
The rapporteur was not for one minute tempted to restate the benefits of the free market and had the courage to dismiss some false theories about unemployment and relocation .
It is a sensible and pragmatic approach which recognizes the balance between maximizing the benefits which inward investment brings a country , while not acting as a disincentive to investors .
But I think later on in the next phase we shall also have to think about a larger denomination , probably a 5 @-@ Euro piece , because the automated machinery industry , and especially industry that makes profits from slot @-@ machine sales , will be entitled to enter the market with the possibility of larger denominations , to offer these and operate them with coins .
They are valid everywhere and the arguments that it will not be possible use them in slot machines , that they will be easier to forge , are complete rubbish .
The debate is closed .
I regret that because of the lateness of the hour , I am not able to respond to the many interesting points that have been made by Mr Watts and Mr Lindqvist and others but I am sure we will have a chance to return to them and the further production of legislation that will effectively enhance the safety of life and vessels at sea and safeguard the maritime environment .
We also consider that we have helped to enrich the report by ensuring the inclusion of certain objectives , such as the replacement of at least the equivalent of 15 % of primary energy demand with renewable energies by the year 2010 , and the reduction of CO2 emissions by 15 % by the same year , compared with 1990 .
As you are aware , a large part of this programme refers to renewable energy sources and also to energy efficiency .
The debate is closed .
Now that social security reforms are in progress in many Member States , a common convergence strategy should be worked out in more detail .
It is particularly important that periods devoted to child care should be treated as pensionable .
And considering employment in relation to competition policy is very difficult - because increased competition means cutting costs , but as we all know , cutting costs to compete better has an effect on employment and the intensity of employment in the sectors concerned .
There are many other criteria and many other methods , and I be dealing with them in the report I am currently preparing on the competitiveness of European industry .
It is our right to insist and we do so .
Thirdly , let us reduce the number of coins , from 8 to 6 and help avoid confusion for the blind and other citizens by graduating the size and value of coins .
We in the Austrian People &apos;s Party have always spoken out in favour of protection up to the age of 18 .
But it must be done , because we cannot go on like this , creating problems like the one you mentioned and many others besides .
Mr Corbett , I think the first thing the Presidency must do is find out exactly what happened , with full respect for the independence of each Member State &apos;s judiciary , of course .
In any case , we expect Council to be very interested in the vote on the Méndez de Vigo and Tsatsos report , which means that its members will probably be here during voting time , and will therefore be available to Members of this House who might want to put proposals to them .
The European Union has again clearly stated its position and made known to the United States that we do not think that mere stabilization provides a sufficient political and moral basis from which to convince the developing countries to participate in the process from now on .
As far as non @-@ European countries are concerned , it is unacceptable that the United States , with 4 % of the world &apos;s population , should be responsible for nearly 25 % of the world &apos;s atmospheric pollution .
A few centuries ago the polar icecaps were melting at a far faster rate than they are today .
We will not be emitting 3 % less in the year 2000 than in 1990 ; in fact we can expect to emit 10 % more .
For example , increased traffic exhaust is the direct cause of the rise in greenhouse gases in our atmosphere .
This group said it was in agreement with testing for alternative products , not only in Luxembourg but also in the United States , because its members have very clearly understood that they could be the first to offer alternatives on the world market as soon as they have them .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0358 / 97 ) by Mrs Heinisch , on behalf of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , on the proposal for a Council Recommendation on European cooperation in quality assurance in higher education ( COM ( 97 ) 0159 - C4 @-@ 0263 / 97 @-@ 97 / 0121 ( SYN ) )
To promote such quality education has now become the job of the Community .
The point , Mr President , ...
We came to the conclusion that the desired goal is still not being reached .
Thank you very much , Mr Liikanen .
Could we please , at some time , have an estimate of the loss of revenue in those zones ?
Its task was to monitor the handling by the EU Commission of the 70 recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry , and to report to the Conference of Presidents about it at the beginning of November .
No one who has read the report can be left with any doubt as to the seriousness with which the task has been tackled .
However , for the moment my group can do no more than entertain well @-@ founded hopes that the arrangements will all work adequately .
I have already informed the chairman of the General Affairs Council of this wish , which I personally consider to be a possible way of clarifying this question and of improving understanding between the institutions .
With regard to this , I am also happy that the codecision procedure will from now on be applied to veterinary and phytosanitary questions , with the objective of protecting public health .
In future we must base our decisions on totally scientific facts and not hyped @-@ up misinformation put forward by the media and the press .
I would also like to say that , in our deliberations , priority is not given to social or economic considerations , although they are important for a number of farmers .
What matters here is that we should decide on independent veterinary control , and that must also be put through by Parliament and the Commission .
The proposal is merely of a technical nature and concerns the procedure for establishing the Community &apos;s position .
We shall look very carefully at the half @-@ yearly progress reports which we discuss in the committees , and we shall check very carefully , Mr President of the Commission , on how the proposal for a new interinstitutional agreement is shaping . This will be submitted early next year , and we must debate it .
Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , the chairman of the committee and Commissioner Bonino for the work they have done .
I will summarize these briefly again . Social partners must have a decisive role in the formation of rules of involvement , and their cooperation is a precondition .
Many of those cultures and traditions are not enjoyed in the same way as perhaps they are enjoyed in Germany or Austria .
We have to compete - not just at the level of economies and markets , but also at the level of people &apos;s hopes and confidence , for the Europe we all want to see in the twenty @-@ first century .
Hopefully my fears are groundless , but yesterday &apos;s meeting of the Council of Ministers was not very promising .
I would like to focus on the Hernández Mollar report .
Question No 26 by David Martin ( H @-@ 0798 / 97 )
In conclusion , I can assure you that we are supporting the reform of the educational system , and particularly of the vocational training system , as regards its links with the manufacturing sector , and its contribution to the private sector , particularly the small and medium @-@ sized enterprises which need it .
Nevertheless , I can read that it says &quot; country &apos;s dialling code &apos; .
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question , as to whether he can promise a deadline by when we can get the refunds we have been promised , so we do not find things dragging on for years again before those involved in the project can get the resources which the Commission promised .
However , there is no point in replying to it now since he is not here himself now .
So this says something for the possibilities for a very successful job summit .
In his explanation , the rapporteur points to the fact that , under commercial pressure , lesser airports are more inclined to turn a blind eye to an aircraft which is in a less than perfect state of repair .
I have to say that my comments are not addressed to Commissioner Wulf @-@ Mathies , because we know of her commitment to cohesion policy , but to the whole College of Commissioners .
Policies should not undercut or counteract each other .
Therefore , we need to rise to the occasion we are living through , and plan financially for the challenges we face , by contributing the means to achieve our ambitions .
The proposal for a regulation which the Commission is presenting to us is along the same general lines as the existing 1994 regulation . The European Parliament contributed to that regulation , by means of an excellent example of collaboration with Council , who incorporated all our amendments into the text .
I think it is symptomatic of the goodwill that has been shown towards the peace process in Northern Ireland .
I therefore leave this House tonight feeling extremely satisfied because I believe that we have achieved real progress towards European integration and the creation of the internal market - albeit only in a small sector .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , women are not being asked , but they are the answer .
The report of the Court of Auditors states that 69 % of the members of the Committee on Social and Economic Affairs are alleged to have committed irregularities with travel expenses , not the European Parliament .
Mr Dell &apos;Alba , in reality , we are all fundamentally in agreement about having a debate on the question , which is indeed a topical subject of major importance .
The basis of a new revision procedure that we are proposing will be the initiative of the European Parliament , of national governments , and of the European Commission alike .
Consequently , in their Intergovernmental Conference resolutions , the Committee on Fisheries and the European Parliament have called for the inclusion of a separate chapter on this issue in the new treaty .
Only then will we be in the position to bring about a new order for Europe , and this is something we should be working towards .
The third pillar is in fact the third bar in the prison cell of the Amsterdam treaty , and confers on Brussels competency in criminal matters !
We must not stick rigidly to an event , and then find that we do not have time to resolve the institutional problems .
Here you merely shifted the same pieces about the board , you came out with more procedures , but changed nothing with regard to fundamentals .
Up to now the treaty has lived in its creators &apos; aseptic cocoon , its contents filtered through speeches by the specialists and diplomats who , for the last three years of often contradictory advances and retreats , have been trying to breathe new life into the old Maastricht Treaty .
Out of concern for transparency , the directive will force postal companies to operate their accounts in such a way that they separate accounts for reserved services from accounts in services open to competition .
It would be nice to think this is true , but the agreement is so timid and hesitant that there is a risk that it will be accepted as such - as a first step - and that the illusion will be created that we are on the right road when we are actually going against the interests of workers .
However , last year the world consumed more coal , more oil and more gas than in 1995 , and by significant amounts , and not only in developing countries .
Second contradiction : the Commission is too much wedded to the idea that , in order to combat the risk to health , the powers of the Commission should be increased , and the rights of the Member States to self @-@ defence be reduced .
For the amount of money they contribute , the least they can expect is safe food to eat .
We also ask to be allowed to point out that big promises were made to the Norrland region of Sweden in connection with the referendum .
From seeing the treaty as a great disappointment and directing massive criticism against it , it now appears that a majority are prepared to vote for the treaty , even though it has not been changed .
We have different traditions , cultures , living conditions and problems , so the Amsterdam Treaty is a compromise .
If the Amsterdam decision has difficulty delivering , i.e. does not deliver the security which the citizens expect , we shall risk losing public support .
Secondly , there is an aspect I am constantly experiencing in the area of foreign policy : the citizen of Europe sees that here there is a large continent that produces a lot , pays a lot , but has very little say in the matter , because it does not speak with one voice , but with many voices compared with the single voice that comes from America . We surely need to correct this .
We can and will do more .
We can recognize the significant progress made when we look at all the issues which are now under discussion concerning something which is barely two years old , the new transatlantic agenda .
Not a word either about Iraq , this virtual genocide under which nearly a million Iraqi children have suffered to date .
Some have said that we were under American dominance or hegemony .
These surveys , and the Commission did not see fit to continue - and we all know the reason why - shows that Europe is today being built by Eurocrats , with the agreement of governments , and that it is not the Europe of the people .
In brief , once again , Europe has postponed political reinforcement , and has left the social question in abeyance , while monetarism and liberal dogma is enforced upon us in the form of constrictive criteria .
Today EU federalism has very little support among the citizens .
A recent report from the Coalition for a Different Europe estimates that at least 700 peaceful demonstrators were arrested during the Amsterdam Summit in June .
However , the treaty we have entered into is based on the idea that the certificates we receive from the exporting countries should be correct .
The conclusion is that we must establish that the Member State in question is responsible by means of Community law .
Does he think that our democratic system works well when it indirectly excludes the equal and balanced participation of women in all decision @-@ taking processes ?
Bill Smith has just lost his fight to prevent 100 fine German cigars going up in smoke - not in his living room but in a UK Customs and Excise incinerator .
The swift adoption of the European Company Statute , naturally involving the workforce , would achieve that desideratum .
The debate is closed .
Mr Commissioner , I only wanted to repeat the question : is a reorganization of the standards system in Europe being considered ?
The debate is closed .
During the course of the reconciliation , the European Parliament made a considerable contribution towards ensuring citizens &apos; rights , particularly with regard to the provisions on confidentiality of communications and public yearbooks .
The European level must be reinforced , but without weakening the other levels .
What is going on there - the disappearance of whole truckloads of cigarettes or meat - is obviously nothing less than organized crime .
Mrs Cederschiöld has said that cooperation should not be centralized , but take place directly between the penal authorities . Then she proposes a multilingual glossary of various legal terms .
Mr President , may I start by heartily congratulating our three rapporteurs Mrs Cederschiöld , Mr Bontempi and Mr Orlando on the quality of the work they have done .
They address the problem of organized crime on a national and a European scale but from a one @-@ sided viewpoint , that of the methodology , the philosophy and the practice of repression .
We therefore need great control and so I ask Parliament to take every possible measure for this phenomenon to be arrested .
We need workable solutions to this .
It is rather more a collection of bits and pieces , and something of a contrast with the actual results in the Council .
As proposed in the Nassauer report , the Commission will continue to take new initiatives with the aid of the new instruments that we now have at our disposal under the Maastricht Treaty .
The Fiscalis programme is therefore a necessary initiative , which means , among other things , that national public officials acquire a thorough knowledge of Community law .
I believe there are many excellent proposals in this report that are well worth considering if we want to send a message to international criminals that we mean business !
Will the Commissioner agree with me that the most important thing the European Union can do is make it absolutely clear we are united behind UN resolutions and we will not have any weakening of the EU position confronting Iraq ?
Here too the present situation is unsatisfactory .
Togo is emerging from a difficult political and economic situation .
But the opposite is the case : throughout the world , children are wandering the streets , are put to work and even sexually exploited .
The resistance of these peoples and the brutal attempts of past Bangladeshi governments to crush this led to gross violations of human rights of which the non @-@ combatants were frequently victims .
The vote will take place at 5 p.m .
The Danish Social Democrats do not agree with this position . The Danish Social Democrats believe that the route to a better employment situation must be through further investments and training of the European workforce .
The Odysseus programme includes training in recognizing false documents , and I have a question about this for Commissioner van de Broek .
If we want the Commission to know at the outset of their deliberations what this House expects from a new regulation , then we must say so now , and not only in December or January .
These points were , however , removed or at least blunted by compromise solutions .
It is a good thing that refugee problems are being solved worldwide and that refugees can be dispersed among several countries .
I could not accept - and the industry could not stand - unilateral implementation by the European Union of the various agreements that have been signed .
In fact , what it is all about is the development of an industry which is of great significance for the future and constitutes in its variety and diversity what distinguishes the European Union from the other large blocks that exist in the world : its diversity , its variety and its creativity .
Negotiations to review the procedures should commence right away so that the European Parliament can be properly heard .
While catch levels for the first are already high , and it would be very difficult to increase their capacity , it seems that there is greater scope for exploiting skipjack tuna ; and the small increase in catches that may result from this agreement will therefore not substantially affect stocks .
In addition to the financial return , at the request of the Guinean government , the European Community also participates , among other things , in the financing of research grants and scientific and technical programmes intended to improve the knowledge of the state of fisheries resources and the support of home fishing programmes .
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports :
I believe that is the spirit in which we must confront this unprecedented challenge for the European Union .
The Council is also discussing defining a particular preaccession strategy for Cyprus , aimed at the individual needs of this island .
On this basis a debate will have to be started on , in particular , some of the issues cited in the report , such as the degree of flexibility needed for the next financial framework and the resources necessary to improve interinstitutional cooperation during the completion of the budgetary procedure .
That leads me finally to relations with the United States .
On these financial questions , as on the procedure for enlargement itself , the approach must be political , in the widest sense of the term .
I happen to know this country really well and am also probably the only Member who speaks Hungarian , whose mother @-@ tongue is Hungarian .
I sincerely believe that each time fundamental decisions have to be taken in Europe , it is this concept that must inspire us .
It says , in point 3 , that all the applicants have the right to initiate negotiations at the same time , but in point 6 it clarifies that it shares the Commission &apos;s opinion which states that intensive negotiations should first begin with those countries which have achieved the most notable progress .
Furthermore , we stress the need for intensified measures in the applicant countries to increase knowledge of Community legislation .
It is quite likely that the meagre resources available for the EU enlargement process will make it tempting to redirect funds traditionally used by the EU and its Member States to help developing countries towards the candidate countries .
You do not consider the principle of additionality , you do not reform your administrative structures , you do not demand sufficient compensation from the states in the area of management of appropriations .
The European Union was founded on the idea that integration brings gains , not burdens .
In my country , in France , nearly ten million people , supporters of the National Front and their families , are denied parliamentary representation , denied on a daily basis the right to freedom of assembly , harassed , illegally prevented from standing in workplace elections , persecuted in their profession , in their free time , in their most fundamental rights , and their position is a great deal more worrying than that of the minorities you talk about .
There is nothing at all in the Rules which objects to that .
The concept of cohesion must in this connection be given a new dimension .
I am extremely concerned at the financial implications of enlargement and the effect this will have on the existing regions within the European Union , the future of the common agricultural policy and the very existence of our family farm structure .
The house of Europe needs solid foundations .
At the same time we must arm the chief negotiators with objective criteria so that they can make such a differentiation so that the countries which have developed further do not have to wait when they have finished negotiations , for the others who are not so well developed .
Applying to join is not hard , but becoming and being a member is on the other hand very difficult .
The European Union is moving towards enlargement without first having institutionally consolidated the common foreign and security policy , and without having solved the crucial problems of its fundamental and effective operation .
I went over to these countries and saw for myself the opportunities which exist there .
So that is the text which applies if it is adopted .
Similarly , we must extend our thinking on the guidelines for the enlargement . How to solve a difficult equation : keeping the own @-@ resources ceiling and not touching the internal policies ( CAP and structural funds ) .
Rather than presuming to lecture peoples who may perhaps have something they can teach us , or at least help us to learn , about how to overcome certain difficulties , we would do better to examine ourselves a little and , before we try to impose our will at all costs , make a determined effort to resolve the problems we say only other people have .
Furthermore we are concerned by the Commission &apos;s proposal for the division of funds between the applicant countries in the first and second rounds of the enlargement process .
The European Union should finally have a real dimension .
First , an intelligent coordination of the budgetary and fiscal policies of the euro zone ; secondly , a more flexible labour market and lower labour costs , notably for the least qualified .
The methods must be adapted to the countries &apos; structures and their different sensitivities to economic cycles and external influences .

The priorities of development strategy must also be based on economic diversification , the promotion of research , the diffusion of new technologies , professional training and job creation .
As these are rumours rather than facts it was decided that it would be better to make a statement in January when we have all the facts and a statement by the Commission .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for an excellent Green Paper .
There are plenty of examples of this .
To support this I believe our conclusion should be that we need fewer , not more rules in Europe &apos;s labour markets .
Secondly , much more emphasis on the role of the non @-@ governmental organizations in the information , prevention , protection and later reintegration of women in their countries .
The Conference adopted guidelines which were aimed directly at the Member States .
I now believe that the text which was eventually decided is clear .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , at the time of the recent adoption of the directive on postal services , we agreed on the principle according to which terminal dues should be based on the real costs borne by the postal services at the distribution end .
The second point is the question of how far statistical requirements can be reduced to a minimum .
That is why every Member with eyes and ears has been able to read what the Presidency resolved in this matter .
Though all the signs are there in principle .
We found that the system has worked against us in Raphael in the past , but in this case has worked to our advantage .
It cannot become the norm .
The word of Mr van den Broek no longer counts for anything , it seems .
And those crying the loudest , namely the Germans , have 2.3 % , the French 3.6 % , the Spaniards 4.1 % , the Belgians 3.5 % , the Danes 5.5 % .
The proposal is pure redistribution in the best Socialist style , and I fail to understand what logic moved the rapporteur to put forward this proposal .
However , this budget also supports solidarity .
The challenges in the area of the third pillar are large within the existing EU .
The reason is mainly that I consider aid for tobacco growers to be absurd , since at the same time the EU has a programme to prevent the harmful effects of smoking .
Thank you !
This makes it rather difficult for us to do our work on separate votes and split votes in time .
Such approaches touch on the question of how far R &amp; D policy , based on the principle of first @-@ rate scientific and technological quality , can serve the objective of economic and social cohesion in the EU without watering down or even abandoning their own objectives .
I think we are submitting a good text to Parliament &apos;s vote and we hope that the Commission and Council can take it into account .
Mr President , I too should like to thank the rapporteur for her hard work .
Nuclear power cannot be a sustainable source of energy .
However , this does not allow me to stay here until this evening , given the fact that tomorrow morning the Energy Charter meeting is being held in Brussels and we have high hopes that tomorrow the 30 sanctions of the Energy Charter will be tabled with a view to putting it into effect .
This is a matter for the competent institution in each Member State to determine , according to the objective of the Community rules on social security for migrant workers , which aims to coordinate , not to harmonize , the national rules of social security systems .
The reports of the Commissioner &apos;s recent change in view in his intended removal of age limits in recruitment notices for the European Commission are most welcome and we look forward to this policy taking effect in 1998 .
It accounts for more than 80 % of the budget .
I am grateful to the honourable Member .
Yesterday the Standing Veterinary Committee decided to postpone the date for introducing the Commission &apos;s proposal by three months .
You had to decide on an exceptional regulation , and now Borchert , led by Germany and not wanting the risk material to be removed , blocks it , and lets you fall into the trap , and you have to postpone your measure by three months .
It has also given huge advantage to our trading partners at the expense of our own producers , also without scientific base .
Finally , regarding the USA , I would like to say quite clearly that our scientific committees , applying the IEO criteria , have not granted the USA BSE @-@ free status .
It has been cut to ECU 22 million for two years , which is ridiculous when we have paid ECU 250 million per year for 15 years for fusion .
But today I have already had a foretaste of that debate .
To talk of squaring the circle would probably be over the top , but Mrs Billingham should nevertheless be congratulated on finally putting together a text on which a broad consensus can be reached .
Naked competition in broadcasting has already proved what it will do .
Obviously we are prepared to do so . But I think the right way to do it is to discuss the initiatives which the Commission develops in different sectors .
The aim of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy &apos;s first amendment is to establish the principle of a single set of coins which would be designed so as to enable the visually impaired and the elderly , who have the greatest difficulty in distinguishing coins , to accept them more readily .
It was not easy , and even now we have still not finished , because there were delicate matters to be settled between the three institutions .
The European summit sided with this policy .
This Parliament did want to support Slovakia with a clear accession offer , but did not want to start negotiations .
In this context , I hope that the problem of the accession of the Turkish Republic is dealt with , both by the European Union and by the national diplomacies , with the necessary care and sensitivity .
Let us hope that this does not mean a change in position on its part and that it remains clearly understood that the future coins will have one national side .
It would be correct to say that some progress has been made in the area of justice and home affairs under the Irish , Dutch and Luxembourg presidencies .
They are outweighed by scepticism and fear .
I have a strong impression that a very large number of representatives of Member States do not quite understand what this means and must mean in the future .
One is the danger of thinking it possible , in such a short time , to resolve each and every one of the problems facing the European Union .
I am not sure that we have given you the best proof of your talent , due to the organization of this debate , which has been interrupted two or three times .
So , this Commission is in place for five years , with its bureaucracy even more immovable and untouchable than itself .
The same applies to the northern dimension , which was mentioned in the Council &apos;s resolution .
Neither the national parliaments nor us !
The new Treaty of Amsterdam has not yet come into force , but the planning cell could nevertheless be put into operation before that happens .
The first problem is the minority question .
Thank you for you answer Prime Minister Juncker .
Having spent seven years of my life studying Latin , I would like to believe that the teaching of dead languages enables a better comprehension of the integrality of European cultural heritage .
To reply to this question I will say that the maintenance of dutyfree sales for travel within the Community is in contradiction with the existence of an internal market without borders .
Two of them - Nos 19 and 20 - relate to transitional arrangements for the treatment of commodities .
The olive in some regions of Spain , and especially in Andalusia , represents a strong source of employment , an environmental concern , the struggle against deserting the land , settlement of population , rural development , and to sum up it represents economic , social and territorial cohesion .
Even Al Capone and Lucky Luciano got caught , so why not a poor olive @-@ grower or oilproducer if he commits a fraud ?
If you smoke this tobacco it blows the top off your head !
The aims of providing proper and accurate information , of encouraging health promotion and education initiatives , of using excise systems to help health measures and of removing temptation in the form of vending machines which are too accessible are not just worthy wishes but practical , effective , proven steps forward .
I would like to point out once again that I have made an official warning about disturbance during the proceedings , and that incident was really a gross infringement of the Rules .
But how can we protect our children ?
Trappers have already gone beyond what is now found in these agreements .
This is absolute rubbish .
It is , by the way , a method which I have discussed in a very positive spirit with Commissioner Pinheiro during a previous question time .
Then there is a further technical correction to be made to Amendment No 36 . My proposal here is as follows : since Amendment No 36 contains an expression which is contrary to previous joint resolutions and designations , this should be adapted to comply with normal forms of designation and Amendment No 36 corrected accordingly , so that we can vote on it in the appropriate manner .
The European Parliament has also said it would leave this ECU 200 million unused on condition that the Council decides on a legal basis for ECU 150 million for an employment initiative .
We are against special directives for sportspeople , because sport can cover a lot of things , and children and young people involved in sport will prefer sports drinks to soft drinks ; they can be half the size but contain the same amount of energy .
The overview is useful and a contribution to more transparency in the field of energy .
But it knew what it was doing , because the Luxembourg Council , on 13 December , has just welcomed , again allusively , a proposal , which has just been made .
Valverde López report ( A4 @-@ 0341 / 97 )
Madam President , I personally would like to welcome Mrs Bjerregaard here .
This is something which we should emulate whenever possible .
Let us also undertake not to trade the rights we have thus obtained , with countries who are not yet ready to substantially reduce their emissions .
I believe that we must draw up international proposals which set out the next course of action and define the rules governing emissions trading and joint implementation ; these rules should be clear , verifiable , reconstructible and fair .
We must intensify our efforts and work towards a comprehensive ban on such devices .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are today discussing the situation in Burundi , and some of you , even those on the platform , may be intrigued to know why the European Parliament is debating this issue at all .
The same arrogant refusal to welcome a delegation from the European Parliament in Nigeria in October , which wanted to hold a series of meetings and visits , that would not submit to the restrictions laid down by the regime , bears witness to the absolute desire not to take positive steps along the road to democratization .
We are quite confident that this will happen and today &apos;s motion will certainly help to support these efforts .
We are concerned about the human rights situation in Djibouti and are disturbed to hear of acts of violence against members of the opposition in advance of the parliamentary elections , which are due to take place on 19th December .
It would be interesting to know the difference between bureaucratic and administrative expenses and expenses intended for the promotion of human rights .
Madam President , though we may question whether the human rights policy pursued by the European Union is consistent , outside Europe it is experienced a great deal more positively , considering the many times appeal is made to our human rights policy .
Unfortunately the Union &apos;s actions are not particularly visible - I mean in so far as European citizens are not familiar with them , because I know they support us in those decisions and therefore ought to be familiar with them - and the political reflections of those actions are normally confined to our parliamentary discussions .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0387 / 97 ) by Mr Murphy , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the communication from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on Benchmarking - implementation of an instrument available to economic actors and public authorities ( COM ( 97 ) 0153 - C4 @-@ 0387 / 97 ) .
Thirdly , the European Union is increasingly associated with various financial backers via joint actions in international structures , such as in the case of Kedo , for example .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
In my opinion , the Conference of Presidents was not entitled to take this decision as it contradicts the Rules of Procedure .
I will not go back over the history of the case , since you are as familiar with it as I am , but I will respond directly to your questions which in some cases deal with the same issue .
None at all .
It is therefore natural that there are demands like this on the part of consumers .
The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy , or to be precise its draftsman , Mrs Anne AndréLéonard , recommended suspending a decision on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement until spring 1998 , as the democratic and human rights position in Uzbekistan is regarded as extremely unsatisfactory .
Furthermore , it is likely that with its population of 22 million and its abundant cotton , gold and natural gas resources Uzbekistan will become an important partner for the European Union during the next few years .
I now invite Mr Wynn to speak for one minute .
So I agree with the question , but I must insist that the European Commission is given the opportunity to define its position .
The emissions of CO2 in particular are not getting any less , as we think they should , but in fact are increasing .
Our rapporteur , Mr Sarlis , apparently worried about the consequences , is making an admittedly notable attempt to slow the speed down and to raise a number of problems which , in his opinion , call for the gradual promotion of liberalization .
My question to the Commission is therefore whether they are prepared to supervise this compliance strictly .
The Commission &apos;s communication does not delve into the problems of a real European space strategy and proposes a series of specific measures which can broadly be divided into three sectors in which space applications are opening up new markets with a high economic and strategic value : multimedia telecommunications , satellite navigation and observation of the Earth .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Desama &apos;s report illustrates the different approach to space travel on either side of the Atlantic .
Article 150 has therefore not been respected .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the European Radical Alliance will also vote in favour of Mr Fayot &apos;s report , thanking the rapporteur for the speed with which we in the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunity have carried out what seemed to be in the general interests .
I would like our sympathy to be expressed , and also a call to the Spanish mining unions and Government to remain calm . However , the Commission must realize that it has to respect what has already been agreed between the unions and the Spanish Government .
I , myself , believe that the rather modest calculations of the pace at which electronic money is going to come into the economy may well prove to be mistaken . If you look at Internet money in the United States that has come through much more quickly .
This shows that the Community &apos;s approach , one of an integrated economic and monetary space , on the basis of a whole set of precise and coordinated policies , is quite justified , an approach indefatigably advocated by Commissioner de Silguy .
When prices are converted consumers must also be shown how to easily calculate the conversion from the Member State currency into the euro .
A stable euro will be good for Europe and good for the world .
I agree with those who think that dual pricing must not be imposed in a compulsory fashion .
Already 64 % of the larger Finnish concerns have said they are getting prepared for the switch .
Deregulation would adversely affect employment , reduce efficiency , damage &apos; public service &apos; interests , destroy a supportive division of costs between rural and city consumers , and adversely affect the legal employment position of the personnel concerned .
In paragraph N the report raises the need for a coordination of tax policies , and in paragraph 8 it talks about the harmonization of tax obligations .
How can these relationships between the European Union , the Member States and the United States be renewed in today &apos;s geographical context , which has been radically changed by the disappearance of the Soviet system , so contributing to the definition of a new international order ?
Because of their economic power , the EU and the USA have a special responsibility for wellbeing on this planet .
We proved how good this can be at the WTO meeting in Singapore , but by the time we had reached Amsterdam we seemed incapable of finding an answer to foreign trade problems that went beyond the immediate , and instead fell back on tolerance and experience .
The building of bridges in the context of the New Transatlantic Agenda , as aimed at and already achieved by the Ties project , involves the public directly in transatlantic relations .
But it has never been so clear in recent years as in the Balkans how important US participation is .
We are therefore requesting in the strongest terms that the correct legal basis should be taken for this Commission proposal , that is Article 100a , and I would like to ask you again , Mr Bangemann , as a representative of the European Commission , whether you will support this European Parliament proposal .
My hands are tied .
Moreover , a rapid alert defective product recall procedure is in place in the Community .
The Commissioner could confirm whether that is the case .
We need a lot more debate , because some Member States think the Community &apos;s involvement in this area should be minimal .
This is the third time I have asked Commissioner Oreja a question about the study , repeatedly promised by the Commission , on the effects of advertising on minors .
I cannot remember the address now , but it is a well @-@ known public fact that that Office has been in existence for a year .
By reducing these substances at source we can also make a major contribution to climate protection .
If the answer is yes , the present debate would itself be a surprising event .
I am pleased that at least some of our suggestions have already been incorporated .
It is not covered by the 1998 vaccine produced with the advice of the WHO .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0399 / 97 ) by Mrs Sierra González , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , on the Commission communication on cohesion and the information society ( COM ( 97 ) 0007 - C40044 / 97 ) .
I am saying it because I believe the information society provides some answers to problems of this kind .
The new British Government is committed to making a success of European cooperation , and our presidency will be an affirmation of this .
But there must also be progress on the reform agenda for Europe itself .
It is the only Parliament in Europe which can have a direct relationship with the European Central Bank and which already has a direct relationship with Ecofin .
According to the Treaty this appointment will run for a full period of eight years , and not for two or four .
Social justice is not everything , but without social justice Europe is nothing !
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , I believe that your policies are based on good will .
We must ask the Algerian authorities if a lack of freedom of the press , whether the right to publish is in the hands of the state or not , is part of their concept of democracy ?
That is what is needed . It is also true that it has not managed to harmonize its criminal laws for corruption and fraud on financial and food matters to be punished .
The second is education and legislation .
In reality this involves a few hundred people who are guarded by the Italian police and strictly controlled by the Italian authorities , and whose asylum cases are being conducted strictly according to legal and statutory regulations subject to the most stringent control and without freedom of movement .
I have to confess also to a private fascination in trying to figure out how some people got 1 1 / 2 minutes , some 2 minutes and some 3 minutes .
I would like to insist , for the following dossiers , on the fact that the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights was given on the five Directives in September 1996 , that is , at a politically different time to today .
One of the objectives of the Fifth Environmental Action Plan was the reduction of atmospheric pollution .
This is why the Commission must make extremely sure that there is a strict reciprocity in concessions , a symmetry of allowed advantages and a globalization of negotiations when concerning issues of foreign trade relations with the United States .
Allow me to point out a danger .
In the Commission &apos;s report there is no review of the joint programmes , i.e. European Year , LLL lifelong learning , or the ADAPT initiative .
Large differences exist , both between categories of businesses and workers .
However , we expect the social partners to provide information and inform themselves about the PEPPER systems , as well as having regard to these systems when conducting their negotiations .
We are looking within the European Union at what further steps we can take .
With the calls for Schengen to be repealed , which is only possible if there is an actual threat to public order and internal security , 2 , 000 people in flight are declared to be a threat for 370 million EU citizens .
We are talking about the fate of people who are forced to escape because they are threatened life and limb , because their property is threatened , because they are driven out of their native country , because members of their family have been killed and because their basic living standards have been destroyed .
Do you not think it is time that we , who are pumping so much money into Russia from the European Union , should gradually start knocking at Russia &apos;s door and tell them that as they have such an influence in Belarus , they should use their influence there so that these questions of human rights can somehow be tackled in order that we can also somehow exert our influence there
Question No 4 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis ( H @-@ 0948 / 97 )
Freedom of conscience and religion are not expressly guaranteed to citizens under the Cuban constitution and , therefore , their application by the Cuban authorities is a question of practice on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis .
I , like he and others , hope that we will manage to be successful .
We cannot on the one hand move towards liberalization , globalization and the application of the full potential of modern transport and information technologies without , at the same time , advocating a regulatory system .
Mr President , could I begin by paying tribute to the work done by Mr Sainjon on this report .
That is quite excellent and very well intentioned , but it is still a risky thing to confuse such politically @-@ controlled subsidy programmes with real measures to create the foundations for investment @-@ friendly and investment @-@ oriented business .
By so doing , they put resources at risk by devastating young shrimp stocks , which are found precisely in this coastal area .
It is in this framework that the measure being discussed is incorporated ; it cannot be temporary , as the structural conditions that fail to favour these regions result from the their separation from the European market to which they export their products .
In the first system , it is the service provider who defines the place of taxation , to which has to be added the distortion of competition outside or inside of the Community .
Obviously you do not have the confidence to open this amendment to discussion or put it to the vote .
Similar figures also came out of a study comparing Switzerland and Austria .
That is a serious infringement of personal integrity .
When we discuss the Eurodac Convention , we must do so in the light of the Dublin Convention , because that is where we find the criteria for which Member State is responsible for the examination of an application for asylum .
This also means that the professional risks accountants run at the moment differ widely .
As far as we are concerned , it is not acceptable for the Swiss to say : We are happy in our isolation . Do whatever you want in the Brenner .
Other complex problems relate to the possible levying of tolls on the four most important passes through the Swiss Alps , a ban on night journeys , and transition quotas for 40 tonne lorries .
Obviously nobody who has received a residence permit in a Member State should risk having his or her data remaining on the database .
They will react against the already perceptible dangers of dislocation , isolation and depression of remote and structurally weak areas , and will not allow the ambitions of capital to entrap and bleed dry the &apos; grey matter &apos; of Europe and bring about the suppression of citizens &apos; rights , acquisitions and liberties .
The Danish Social Democrats have today voted for a resolution on Kurdish refugees .
Five important negotiations have been concluded successfully and every effort is needed to reach an agreement in the transport sector too .
In Europe , at the end of this century , it must surely be possible to create a genuinely common traffic policy .
The Development Assistance Committee of the OECD provides a more or less satisfactory answer to this , by proposing to use as development aid evaluation criteria , pertinence , efficiency , impact of the development and durability .
These measures should not be considered exceptional as they serve as a model for normal behaviour in any legal system .
That is why a new criterion should be included which forbids exports to countries which do not meet the terms of this UN register .
The Council of Europe &apos;s Monday Clone Protocol expressly omits any reference to reproductive clones and is therefore further @-@ reaching than the demand which has just been detailed .
The signature and ratification of the Council of Europe Convention last April , and its additional protocol specifically banning human cloning , could be the start of the solution , but the Union &apos;s partner countries must be urgently involved .
Mr President , this is my first speech from the Green Group in the European Parliament , and I hope you will be gentle with me .
The fourteen opposition candidates shared the remaining 60 % , but their divisions , maintained by constant disagreements , has brought them in disorder into a Parliament where Mr Arap Moi &apos;s party has retained the absolute majority by two seats .
Let this Parliament show not the least indulgence or understanding with regard to ETA assassins and torturers .
With the intake of new projects we are shooting randomly from the hip .
Aid must stimulate people to take matters in hand themselves , and should not become a habit .
We work on the basis of legal regulations which in fact have been aid down by the Council , and which contain a host of elements intended to guarantee complete transparency on the one hand , but at the same time mean extremely time consuming procedures .
Experience so far shows that EU aid goes mainly to former colonies of some of the Member States , which means that certain countries which need help are put into another queue .
It gives priority to support and structural adaptation , and only afterwards to the reduction of the debt held by the highly indebted ACP States .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
Even if the gross registered tonnage of the fleet does not increase by transferring vessels , such a substitution of younger vessels for older ones will lead , inevitably , to an increase in the effective fishing capacity of the Latvian fleet .
I would counsel against losing the disadvantage of those areas in a much bigger area just for the sake of administrative convenience .
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , I am very pleased that this debate is being held , during the plenary session , and that it is part of the prospective review of the structural policy of the CAP , as it seems particularly important to me that we should discuss , within these walls , the way in which the European Union can , alongside the Member States , contribute by means of a controlled policy towards the protection of ecologically sensitive areas of agricultural production .
I find this very disturbing and want to register a protest in this House .
Thank you , Mr Bangemann .
However , I shall pass on the criticisms that have been made here both to the Bureau and to the Conference of Presidents . We can then decide whether to forward the matter to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities , or whether , as Mrs Fontaine has suggested , we can find a simple solution in advance , so that we have acceptable arrangements in future .
Training seafarers so as to avoid accidents can accordingly make an indirect contribution to preventing sea pollution and to environmental protection .
However , anything that comes out of this study must definitely be included in the water management policy which , as Mr Izquierdo Collado said , is in its infancy in the European Union .
Why should water not play a similar role ?
That is why the draft framework Directive on water obliges Member States and regions to jointly seek to solve their water problems within shared hydrological systems , but does not aim for large @-@ scale transfers of water between hydrological networks .
This House should support the agreement but demand that the human rights situation is kept under close attention .
Quite rightly , the Council in Edinburgh blew the whistle on the Commission .
The fact is that extensive areas of the Community suffer cycles of unbearable drought , and without water there can be no life , progress or solidarity .
I want to stress to the Commission that the difficulties that we have had with them have been due to a mistaken loyalty to their predecessors .
The De Luca and Wemheuer reports represent a courageous stance .
A second matter I should like to mention , ladies and gentlemen , is that the Committee on Budgetary Control cannot properly carry out its task concerning the granting or not of discharge to the Commission in respect of its responsibility to implement the budget , for the simple reason that the Commission does not provide the European Parliament with any figures .
But it should be clear that this unit can only be a reality if the budget authorities support it .
The ECU 150 million loan means that the European Union will be meeting almost one quarter of Ukraine &apos;s anticipated financial deficit for the 1997 to 1998 period , which has been estimated at ECU 765 million .
Here the Commission refers to major breakthroughs and achievements , including the satellite monitoring of forest fires , new discoveries relating to the volcanic eruption on Iceland and the development of an ocean survey robot capable of operating 6 000 metres below sea level .
Finally , with the adoption of the Fifth Framework Programme and its specific programmes , the Council is , on the one hand , setting out the future financial prospects for the Union , and on the other , establishing conditions which will again bring into question the principle of multi @-@ annual budgets and predictability of resources which is the very essence and interest of the Programme .
It has been very gratifying to see active and constructive efforts aimed at pushing the directive through .
When does the Commission think it will get around to doing something about this , or does it hope to divert us from the really important issues by submitting technical questions ?
I have no particular information to offer by way of an answer ; I therefore take note of it and will pass on the question to the group composed of the three general secretaries .
If Community law has been infringed , that will most probably be due to contravention of the European rules of competition , mainly Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty , rather than an infringement of the law in relation to the Cassis de Dijon affair mentioned by the Member , which covers the elimination of quota restrictions on imports between the Member States pursuant to Article 30 of the Treaty .
Although the compromise proposal is very much a backward step compared with the first reading , I still firmly support it , particularly as regards the mandatory values for 2005 .
Firstly , reasonable time limits must be defined to allow industry to adapt to the new standards . Secondly , we need to know if controls greater than those strictly necessary would not cause exactly the opposite effects to the ones we are hoping for , in particular an increase in cars , thus provoking an ageing of the cars on the road and a worsening of pollution and safety risks , along with economic difficulties for the manufacturers .
The debate is closed .
As Mrs Schleicher said , it is a tame cemetery for data , that is not really good enough .
We know that in today &apos;s EU it is the case that certain countries allow the irradiation of foodstuffs , while other countries do not allow it , such as Sweden and Germany .
You are telling us you are accepting no amendments whatsoever !
Finally , we should not forget that the Member States voted unanimously for the former version of this directive which effectively excluded 50 % of EU territory from its scope .
Despite the uncharitable remarks made , as Mr Watson said , about the Commissioner being a speaking weight machine , I ask the Commissioner to be more charitable herself and tell us how much money there is in the landfill bank and what the cost of this proposal will be .
You are a former Vice @-@ President of Parliament and you can well understand that when a new measure is first applied , it is impossible for us to have sorted out all the details in advance .
Mr President , one of the troubles with this procedure is that it draws attention to the fact that Members attend the votes because they are paid for it but they do not attend the debates .
However , let us not forget that it is the United Nations , not Saddam , that is responsible for this .
There is no need for a new UN resolution for such intervention .
Like a proud terrier , Great Britain is walking next to the American elephant , and is saying : listen to us making all this noise .
The fact is that we do not play an active role , but nevertheless I think that our debate and the joint resolution which we present today are an important contribution , for we in the European Parliament will reach a decision before the Council and the Commission have been able to work out a common position .
We have just heard from a leading French socialist the sort of words I might use myself .
As it was not a formal Council , it was not possible to have formal conclusions but the Presidency , in representing the European Union in the various forums where the problem of Iraq has been discussed , has stuck to the text which was agreed at the end of that meeting , as one on which the Presidency could express a common view .
It is a question ...
Whilst the modern car is 40 times cleaner than its equivalent in the 1980s , air quality will be greatly enhanced by the implementation of the proposals before the House .
Afterwards , I do not know how we will be able to take part in an honest election campaign in which we keep saying : Europe is working on behalf of consumers .
Last year , during the annual meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights we saw a terrible display of 15 EU nations towards China .
The Council promised better , and why not in fact ?
We accept that they have the potential to be a force for good in Nigeria , but they must accept greater responsibility in response to the latest crisis .
The maintenance of democracy and human rights is one of our highest principles .
The opposition , however , has not yet participated in the work of the Committee on Institutional Affairs , giving as a reason , the fact that the parliament does not have the moral authority to rewrite the new constitution , and this gives us cause for concern .
I would like an assurance from the Council that the EU Commission will actually step aside from the process on this and allow the people to make up their own mind and that it will be in accordance with the constitution of Ireland which prohibits the use of public money to promote one side of the argument in a referendum .
I should also like to thank the President @-@ in @-@ Office for his reply .
Finally , is it intended that the EU regulations should replace national regulations on weapons exports to other countries , or will the national regulations even be taken over ?
As the honourable Members will know , when the Council adopted directives abolishing fiscal frontiers from 1 January 1993 , it decided to put an end to tax and duty @-@ free sales for intra @-@ European Community passengers because retaining such sales would be inconsistent with an internal market without frontiers .
The Council has yet to really think about the post @-@ 1999 situation .
I recall the discussion Mr Kinnock had with us in the Committee on Transport and Tourism when he took office , and in which he promised emphatically - I would almost say , with his hand on his heart - to put an end to state aid .
Together this will enable the development which will allow us to satisfy passengers &apos; demands by the year 2000 .
In this context , one of our biggest and most important tasks is to help ensure that safety requirements are increased and not reduced .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , I did not intend to spoil your future as announcer of the lottery numbers on the BBC , but you also , of course , have a past as a parliamentarian , and I had asked a question which certainly did not come up in your speech , that is , the question of how this nationality plate will be treated in Switzerland .
I will , however , have it checked and then we shall return to it .
The biggest problems are the use of hormones and antibiotics , the use of substances that are prohibited .
In order to maintain the competitiveness not only of agriculture but also of its related industries , it is important to supply it with the means necessary to participate in the game of world competition , particularly within the controlled framework of reducing Community aid to agriculture , as laid out in Agenda 2000 .
A step by step procedure in the release of gene technology modified organisms is a necessary condition and we must not allow a general go @-@ ahead to small and large @-@ scale open experiments .
Finally , I would like to emphasize once more that it is essential to mark these new products so that consumers themselves can decide what they want to eat .
Mr President , on a point of order .
That , too , is something we are worried about , since we are witnessing procedures in which collective agreements are being broken and flexible labour relations are being imposed , as shown by the recent amendment passed by the Greek Government concerning Public Corporations and Organizations , and the plans to make Olympic Airways &apos; healthier &apos; .
We know that it is precisely the raising of local resources which inhibits applications for EU resources .
If Saddam Hussein continues with this attitude , there will only be disagreeable solutions involving constraints which will obviously not be totally satisfying .
It is clear that in certain cases liberalization has led to reduced influence for union bodies and therefore for employees .
They have no freedom of movement or expression .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I find myself in a very difficult position because , naturally , the European Commission shares the sorrow felt by the Members for the victims and understands the irrationality of the accident , which should never be repeated .
But we must also consider and say that the international community of states is really called upon to do everything in its power - and this applies not just to Mauritania , but also to other states where slavery still exists - to bring this situation to an end .
We confirm that hopefully - the Commission will perhaps be able to say something about this - we have re @-@ established the TACIS Democracy Programme .
I hope that it now puts massive support behind making the agreement work .
Mr President , concerning the four resolutions on floods which the House has just voted for , three @-@ quarters of an hour ago an insult was offered to the dignity of Parliament .
Finally , as all Members will know , many times Member States use the European Union as a scapegoat for unpopular national rules .
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 9.00 a.m .
It is thought that the outcome should be &apos; processed &apos; quickly and painlessly through Parliament and the Council .
However , information relating to cases of fraud is already available in the Annual Report .
The Green Group does , of course , support Mr Wynn &apos;s proposal .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0021 / 98 ) by Mr Giansily , on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control , on the Court of Auditors &apos; Special Report No 5 / 97 on management of the Community cereals trade involving export refunds , special import arrangements and regional aid schemes , together with the Commission &apos;s replies ( C4 @-@ 0351 / 97 ) .
In conclusion , please allow me to say that this Special Report and its concerns are in my view a good example of how the Community bodies , namely the Court of Auditors , the Parliament and the Commission , can cooperate here in order to be able greatly to improve the implementation of various EU policies .
Why ?
Quite simply , we are seeing here the future Member States .
Order of business
The Commission , as Mrs Bonino pointed out , must use its powers much more consistently .
Unfortunately , the list of countries where women are looked down on and ill @-@ treated is much longer than this .
It also looked again at the question of the timetable for a rescission of the contract or a reduction in price .
And if one brings the proposed change in the burden of proof into the equation , i.e. the supposition that the fault was already present at the time of purchase , this overall arrangement represents an increased burden on the small and medium @-@ sized enterprises in particular , who would in no way be in a balanced position in relation to the improved consumer protection brought about by this change .
Here it is a question of giving the consumers clear and easy @-@ to @-@ understand labels and information on the food .
How do we make allowances for the irrational or the emotional ?
We cannot take our leave when it suits us .
The best system of supervision is openness and publicity .
The European Parliament must appeal not only to the European institutions to prepare people and SMEs for the euro - national governments and administrations also need to play their part .
It is also essential that the ECB presents and explains to the democratic institutions of the Union , and to the public in general , the decisions taken in carrying out its duty .
As regards the practical aspects of the introduction of the euro for those who are going to use the single currency on a daily basis , I want to underline the need for information on the changeover to be targeted on all users , just as it already is on small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
I still believe we are going forward into the unknown with undue haste and without clear knowledge of the longterm effect .
I think all countries should do this ; it should not be a technocratic choice by a finance minister and some civil servants .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , while listening to the debate , I remarked to myself what a change there is compared with the debate just eighteen months or two years ago ; there is unanimity and consensus on the changeover to the euro and the single currency .
Sorry , I thought I was up to date , but the euro is progressing so fast that it is impossible to be totally up @-@ to @-@ date .
This means that anything urgent must have a first reading in Parliament by autumn at the latest .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
During the Parliamentary sitting , certain amendments from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection were adopted as additions to the notion of consumer expectations and the buyer &apos;s right to an alternative option , thus making the text extremely vague and favouring the development of litigation .
Ownership costs SEK 20 000 per variety .
Some would like the Commission to be present as such in the Codex Alimentarius , a scientific body recognized by the WTO .
It appears that the supporters of this proposal are inspired by those areas of Community responsibility such as the hundreds of thousands of devastated households in the agricultural sector , or by deregulation , redundancies and doubt as to the possibility of national intervention - for example in air transportation and telecommunications .
Any Member who sits in this House and represents the Presidency should also protect that right to reply .
What we must look at jointly is the construction of cars , crossborder traffic and the increasing amount of traffic on our roads , so there is plenty to be getting on with .
Secondly , however , far from ignoring her , I already took over ten minutes when I had been allocated five , and I could not get every response in .
Secondly , if stipulated by legal requirements , the Commission should propose a new directive specifically devoted to hazardous rail transport .
The OECD Code of Conduct for multinationals must be incorporated into the agreement in such a way that it is binding and enforceable .
Yet the US is stepping on the brakes .
The Belgian national contact point does so reactively and all other affiliates replied negatively .
Of course as a parliament we find it hard to accept that the negotiations have to a very great extent been kept secret from the public and from parliaments , as the report notes .
Otherwise we will be helping to spread myths about a plot , and the MAI may well fail and be added to the cemetery of stillborn projects .
Among negotiators there is now a consensus that the MAI should not undermine the GATT acquis , excluding audiovisual services , that is to say , the conclusion of the Uruguay Round .
Subject : Beef market
We have done so in this case .
Question No 48 by Mark Watts ( H @-@ 0032 / 98 )
Question No 64 by José Apolinário ( H @-@ 0173 / 98 )
This is a very serious issue .
It remains for us to examine whether the programme , as it has been formulated , is effective .
Anyway , in the short time allocated to me I do not want to say much more about Alzheimer &apos;s disease than Mr Poggiolini has already said .
This was a matter brought up by Ms McKenna when she pointed out the need for better coordination in this area .
I would also like to say , and here I agree with Mrs Flemming , that the directive on the freedom of movement of doctors , on reciprocal recognition , of which I was also a supporter , has failed .
Are the financial perspectives going to start from scratch ?
When the eight programmes were given the envelope of money , the money was all gone .
This cannot go on .
I started by saying that we do not intend to delay the negotiations .
Yet that is what we had asked for .
And that should be the standard conduct and behaviour of us all , because I do not think it makes much sense for us to limit our action to a complaint , at a time when Parliament is making a positive contribution to the process of enlargement .
I thank you , Mr President , for again giving me the opportunity to try to clarify some of those points and I hope that there will be assurances given to Parliament which will enable Parliament to give an opinion to allow the process of enlargement to proceed in a speedy and effective way .
Mr President of the Council , Commissioner , I am ashamed when I turn on the television as I did this morning and see the American representative , the special envoy , in Pristina , but no special envoy from Europe .
In conclusion , Mr President , the resolution proposed by the two large groups today is the weakest this Parliament has ever devoted to the situation in Kosovo .
Under my reading of the rules , which were adopted by the Bureau without consultation with Parliament , I am entitled , as a Member , to stand up at every roll @-@ call vote and state that I am present but I am not participating in the vote .
What I would like to ask you most urgently is : can we please carry on with the votes ?
That is why I support the amendments proposed by Mark Watts aimed at maintaining fair competition between the ferries and the Shuttle , whilst staying in keeping with the position within Europe as a whole .
Whereas there has been considerable disagreement among scientists regarding the effects of organophosphorous sheep dip on farmers who have used it , there has been increasing evidence to support campaigners &apos; arguments that use of organophosphorous sheep dip can lead to damage to the nervous system .
Every country should have the right to go further by keeping or introducing tougher rules .
The multinationals would become masters of our world in the name of the sacrosanct free market and free competition . They would hold all power and , in particular , the possibility - and this really is the limit - of bringing a state to justice on the grounds of a &quot; loss of profit opportunity &apos; , a company &apos;s profits prevailing over the choice and interest of a people !
Environment , health and consumer issues should be given greater priority in political work at European level .
If we can resolve the short @-@ term problems we must increase our efforts to resolve the long @-@ term problems .
We need a new framework . It should be established in London .
The Summit will also launch some new initiatives , possibly in areas like money laundering , child welfare , environment , etcetera .
Finally , I am turning to the Commission and the Council to ensure adequate financing for the Court , and for that purpose a line should be created in our budget to ensure that the permanent international court can work properly .
The objective of the resolution prepared by the European Parliament is precisely to ensure that hope can become reality .
Last year under the Dutch Presidency the Council of Industry Ministers concluded that Member States and the Commission must increase their awareness of the impact their actions can have on competitiveness and , under the Luxembourg Presidency , the Council adopted a work programme carrying this forward .
Perhaps it is time we invented a new word that is translatable in order to ease everybody &apos;s difficulties .
I just do not believe that .
That is a basis , or more of a basis , for political stability .
I think that our countries set a really bad example by continuing to use antiquated methods such as child labour .
I know that the Commission and members of the Council have consulted with the Association of Scheduled Airlines which represents the larger airlines in Europe , but no charter airlines were consulted , no airport managers were consulted and no ferry companies were consulted .
I set out the legal position and some of the history .
We must ensure that older people remain integrated in society and that solidarity between the generations is promoted and older people are assured dignity and non @-@ discrimination in their twilight years .
We are rightly tied to the European social model , even though social policies in all of our countries cost a great deal of money .
I thank the rapporteur , as well as the House , for this report .
I would like to say clearly that the Foundation is doing good work .
It should , however , be noted that the Commission itself does not escape criticism .
Since the creation of the CIS , the twelve member countries have largely contented themselves with declarations of intention , in spite of constructive proposals on the part of the Belorussian President , Alexandre Loubachenko , and evident good will on the part of the participating states .
We need an enhanced proposal , a global proposal , a proposal with vision and with objectives concerning future relations between the European Union and Ukraine .
I believe , as the rapporteur said , that it is important that the directive can come into force quickly .
At first reading of the European Parliament , we amended the draft programme submitted by the Commission , while essentially sharing its approach .
However , we have to be clear about one thing .
This support varies from one state to another , because the degree of information varies and because the media in some countries willingly publicize the issue whilst others are more reticent to do so .
I am not only speaking for the Socialists but also , as Mr Colajanni already pointed out , as a person who has been involved very directly with this report , since I had the privilege of being rapporteur on the report on the MEDA Regulation and , at the time , put forward proposals - without success , however - which would have given our policies a more European character .
It cannot therefore , as the rapporteur proposes , be applied to the MEDA Regulation , which belongs to the acquis communautaire .
I shall try to ensure that framework decisions are mainly used .
The Quaestors &apos; note was quite clear : that it should be on the vote , and the vote means that vote which is about to take place and not to pre @-@ empt that vote in any way whatsoever .
Over and above the free movement of people and the human and cultural exchange that may be offered by the programme , one of its central elements lies in working together with young people from other European countries in the voluntary pursuit of a shared civic objective .
This desire for children exists and , in view of the serious question which I raised a moment ago , the events of last summer in Paris during the World Youth Days truly give hope to us all , to all the countries of Europe , indeed not only to Europe but to the rest of the world as well , in terms of what Europe can offer it .
The sole justification was to enable him to recover his passport and to give himself up in Germany , which he did , although he was immediately released on bail .
During the gigantic operation of four years ago , at which I was an observer together with former Commissioner and Member of this Parliament Mr Cheysson , Mr Cheysson and I made a plea for Europe to continue monitoring and for it not to assume that once the elections were over , everything would automatically be fine afterwards .
A meeting is to be convened in Geneva in the near future during which , under normal circumstances , it would be possible to negotiate the cancellation of that debt .
In one or two cases the families knew more or less the whereabouts of those who had been abducted .
The army barracks where I once served is named after Wilberforce , the anti @-@ slavery campaigner .
You now have a complete picture of the breakdown of tickets .
So let me share with you a heartfelt letter which I received from a football fan from Aberdeen , in my constituency . He says , &apos; I write to you in the hope that the European Parliament can do something about the ridiculous ticket allocations for the World Cup finals in France .
You , Mr Van Miert , and you , the authorities responsible for competition at national level , you deserve a red card , go and sit on the touchline . We are going to deal with this . &apos; 
The EU must take steps towards judicial cooperation more quickly than before , not just to protect the Union &apos;s financial interests but , more importantly , in the interest of our citizens &apos; safety .
There is no doubt that , for example , the fact that our ACP colleagues did not vote for a very moderate resolution , which only involved a request for free elections , caused a certain frustration on our part , as Europeans , and it was undoubtably influenced by the topographic factor of the location of the meeting .
Madam President , let me first of all congratulate Mr Robles Piquer for the quality of his report on the work of the ACP @-@ EU Joint Assembly in 1997 .
( The Minutes were approved )
However , we believe that we should take this opportunity to look at the various current control and inspection systems used in the NAFO regulatory area .
Fishing is distinct from other means of livelihood in that fish stocks cannot be increased .
There are two considerations .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
I am very glad that the Commissioner is here to listen to this debate .
Congratulations , Mr Cunha .
The Commission , however , intends bring forward a Council regulation on the control of unloading and transfers : this proposal is already being prepared and the Commission believes it should provide a more appropriate framework .
The task of reconciling these ideals becomes insoluble if it is misused for deregulation , as is the case here .
This morning , at the beginning of the sitting , a Member , by virtue of a very broad interpretation of Rule 126 - as is often the case - made a complimentary speech about Mrs Fontaine .
If this is not the case , it will , of course be put to the vote in Parliament .
We will check the situation .
That means it will be very easy for them to make comparisons .
I have considerable sympathy for those who oppose the introduction of such networks .
There is a great problem when you talk about aviation and , in particular , airport charges , in that the airlines always think that the airports are overcharging them and the airports think that the airlines are always wanting something on the cheap .
In other words , it is just a recommendation . We think it deserves a stronger legal base , in view , I repeat , of its social importance .
I believe that the Commission and the Council should recognize this fact as we do in Parliament .
The various Member States will have to create more scope for cross @-@ border health care , including the purchase of medicines abroad .
What has been recorded is that Mr Rübig asked the President a question about crime in Brussels and about whether this subject has been referred to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities .
However , on reflection , that would be rather childish .
To achieve this there is a need for cooperation between the Commission and the bodies , including the Member States .
We could just as easily have got together and said &quot; discharge with critical comments or postponement of discharge &apos; .
Madam President , I would like to begin by stating that I fully agree with Mr Elles &apos; suggestion that the discharge should be postponed on account of the errors and omissions reported by the Commission in the administration of Community funds . This is more particularly evident in the light of the unacceptable attitude adopted by the Commission in failing to furnish in due time the information required by Parliament to analyse these matters and issue an opinion , as appropriate under such circumstances ; in particular , in situations where such accusations of corruption and irregularities exist , as has occurred in the tourism sector .
And finally , you are envisaging Eurodeployment .
This is good news , but I think it will throw the entire system into confusion , because the Spanish authorities seem to be saying that the manufacturers are selling their cigarettes knowingly and despite warnings to known smugglers .
We must , therefore , decentralize and deconcentrate as quickly as possible and the recipient country and authority must be able to re @-@ organize their working methods accordingly .
Mr President , words are obviously very important things and words can be used either to emphasize something or to conceal it .
So far we have used the Maastricht Treaty as best we can .
( The matter was referred back to the committee responsible )
I believe that in this field we have much more to do , particularly in terms of access to employment and the fight against all kinds of latent discrimination , which affects disabled people all too often .
These extra receipts should be put into a fund for environmental improvements at the airport itself , or for cofinancing investments which people living nearby have to make as a result of disruption or damage .
For this reason we should be working with ventures which already exist and , instead of complicating the process by introducing a tendering system , let us therefore first take on those which have been successful .
I come from an area with a tremendously sparse population and I have to ask : what is small ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the House , Mr Pronk &apos;s report follows on from the &quot; growth and employment &apos; initiative which you mentioned , and which Parliament approved by making the necessary resources available during the 1998 budget procedure .
We must replace the old donor / recipient mentality with the idea that we have to solve the world &apos;s future problems together .
This behaviour is schizophrenic .
I would therefore like us to have a somewhat less rigid view of this state aid .
Regions eligible for Community funds wonder why they cannot receive regional aid , at Member State level .
Now that the main shipbuilding nations of Asia are in the grip of an economic crisis , and devaluation of their currency has increased their competitiveness in exports , it is a most opportune moment to embark on global measures to end aid .
In the second part of paragraph 2 , it says : &apos; It is up to the President of a sitting to rule on the admissibility of supplementary questions which must relate directly to the subject of the main question . &apos; 
I would ask you to please sit down and allow me to proceed with my work properly , with the following question .
There are also legal obligations arising from other directives such as third countries requesting approval for exporting fisheries or for exporting fresh meat to the European Union .
Thank you for the information .
Finally , it does not take a study to understand what is increasingly being perceived by public opinion , namely that duty @-@ free is , in fact , a hidden , regressive subsidy , favouring the consumption of alcohol and tobacco to a large extent .
If we look at the shipbuilding programme , there are still subsidies for lay @-@ offs and restructuring , for innovation and environmental protection ; that is enough subsidies to apply over five years .
In its regulation , the Commission proposes that contract @-@ related aid should cease on 31 December 2000 , but the recitals of the same regulation introduce a safeguard clause to cover that eventuality .
But here I am ready , and I emphasize this , to consider along with the Council of Ministers how to limit regional aid , possibly even by combining it with certain other measures .
There has been a lot of fuss made about my report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
Our concerns lie in a different direction , however .
Mr President , we all know here that statistics are somewhat unpopular , particularly in the eyes of those who have to supply the data .
If anyone thinks there has been a change in the rules , which of course is not the case , I will submit the question to the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities .
One of the major priorities for our Presidency is settling the mandate for the Lomé renegotiation .
We therefore believe that we need to move on from a marginal and experimental decentralized cooperation to its development as a priority , be it within the framework of external cooperation - Lomé Convention , MEDA Programme , and so on - or in the direct actions of the European Union .
Making a link between the targets of armaments restriction and development in the health and education fields is something very important .
However , I do deplore the fact that we have not managed to revise the list of countries covered by the Lomé Convention .
We therefore need a parallel policy for trade measures .
I agree with those who say that logically the poorest countries should become part of the ACP .
Mrs Lalumière &apos;s excellent report originally gave the impression , and still does to some extent , that there will be a new bi @-@ zonal Europe made up of Russia on the one hand and the rest of Europe on the other .
A few days ago , the Russian human rights activist and Duma member Kovaliev expressed his concern about the anti @-@ democratic tendencies which still exist in his country .
The new directives are no longer directives of the Council alone , but directives of the European Parliament and of the Council .
The way to do that is to make sure it is accountable to the only democratically elected body we have among the European Union institutions .
There are no choices but ideological ones , of the same type as that of Vincent Auriol , &quot; I &apos;ll close the banks and lock up all the bankers &apos; .
I conclude , Mr President , by saying that we have to realize that in setting out along this road , Parliament must show that it is up to its new role as the European Central Bank &apos;s main partner for dialogue .
If we want European public opinion to support the single monetary policy which the Central Bank is going to implement as from 1 January 1999 , this policy must be clearly explained and well presented .
I am very glad that a start has been made with matters of substance , and that perhaps some people who saw things as very open and very casual have now changed their conception , that we are actually talking about subjects which are very important for Europe and the future .
That may cost more in grant aid in the short term if we are to achieve permanent stability in Europe in the long term and the cautious approach must be followed .
People around Karadzic and Mladic , and others , are particularly responsible for this .
If one takes , for instance , Amendment No 6 , where Parliament proposes that the Commission work with the high representative , I do not see any major problem with that proposal .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are now going to deal with a block of ten questions .
I am pleased that Mrs Ewing has raised the point on behalf of the town in her constituency which has the same name as the diplomat after whom the marbles are named .
Subject : Severe repercussions for weakest economies of introduction of euro
Currently , under existing Treaty provisions the EIB publishes an environmental policy statement which sets out its general approach .
Allocations are already rare . European public opinion is already looking at us because of budget restrictions in every country .
This puts me in a reflective mood , because it is quite possible that in future we shall discover that other commonplace things are also vitally important .
This is the objective of Amendment No 20 which corrects the original text in this sense .
Amendment No 1 : it is important to recall that in adopting Directive 89 / 381 / EEC , which governs the placing on the market of medicinal products made from human blood and plasma , the Council agreed that Member States should encourage the voluntary and unpaid donations of blood and plasma as the starting material for the manufacture of medicinal products .
I will now conclude my speech , ladies and gentlemen . Music has always united our countries , overcoming all sorts of frontiers and barriers .
It is not an adversarial situation where we are trying to score points off one another ; instead we are actually trying to get a budget which we can all agree to and this adjustment of the financial perspective .
We have , that is Mrs Dührkop Dührkop has found a formulation in paragraph 8 of her guidelines , in which , as never before in this House , Mr Fabre @-@ Aubrespy , she states in writing that Parliament is only prepared to join in creating a 1999 budget growth rate which is on the level of the budget growth rates of the Member States .
Training and refresher courses are considered to be two of the key instruments for developing adaptability and entrepreneurship and , above all , for enabling young people and women to find jobs .
Unfortunately , I had a puncture in my wheelchair this morning and that is what delayed my arrival - I had to get it repaired .
Finally , I would like to point out that there is an error in the Swedish version when it comes to the national ombudsmen &apos;s duties , but this does not apply to the other language versions .
In order to have a true citizenship which takes account of people from third countries , the procedures for granting visas must be improved , there must be better information and openness in these procedures , and the right to family reunification must be extended and strengthened , while always ensuring respect for fundamental rights and the right to dignified treatment and privacy .
I come from the Aachen border region , and I am aware of all these problems and the difficulties which exist .
The general conclusion is that the existing legislation is adequate .
We must push this through , in the interests not only of Parliament , but also of the European Union as a whole , so that our aid in Bosnia @-@ Herzegovina can finally be effective and we can catch up with the Americans .
Although we might consider that there is now virtually no risk as regards AIDS , it is vital that we take all known measures to eradicate all risks of transmitting the BSE agent .
Following the overthrow of the USSR and the promotion and support , direct or indirect , of the so @-@ called Russian Mafia , which controls a large section of the economic and therefore the social life of the country , plans are being pushed through to strengthen the process of democratization , which aims to completely marginalize the Russian people and to subject them to the geopolitical dictates of NATO and the USA .
I think that the NGOs &apos; appeals for a boycott of tropical wood are completely justified , and now more so than ever .
We have also learnt today that the Turkish Government will essentially be responsible for Cyprus joining the European Union with the annexation of the north of the island occupied by Turkish troops .
Then we should mention the terrible deterioration in the living conditions of the prisoners , as we have seen in particular in the Greene Jail in Pennsylvania .
But it is those people who actually took a gamble on the whole process , and have now done so again , who must bear responsibility .
Only then will it earn the same high reputation as the Deutsche Bundesbank has in my country .
The political nature of the project will also surely undermine the position of the Central Bank and make democratic accountability harder to achieve .
Austria has shown us , however , that every transitional period comes to an end at some time .
Reference is made to the rule of law , but only as an obligation for others .
So the enlargement process will last several years .
If we assume that this European police force exists , with rights and , of course , powers of control under the rule of law - so the Member who has just spoken need not get excited - this would not mean that the results which such policing would bring could be used judicially to the correspondingly necessary extent .
Under the auspices of this Convention , the suppressive aspects of this European action need to be strengthened .
What we must seek to do is establish the fastest and simplest procedure possible .
What we have also got to look at is the economic consequences and there are a number of unanswered questions here , too .
I am not saying that we should maintain the duty @-@ free facilities ad infinitum , but I do think it is very bad that on the one hand we are saying to society that we are abolishing it , yet on the other hand , the planned tax harmonization - which was supposed to be further advanced than it is at the moment - and the internal market are not yet a reality .
Tomorrow Parliament will vote for the resolution demanding such a study .
Mr President , this is the text relating to the Randzio @-@ Plath report .
We had , in fact , already suggested it .
Today &apos;s document is not a strategic document , but it creates a useful premise for a European strategy on satellite navigation which we will be discussing in the near future .
That is why it is important that in implementing the Plan the EBRD should take every opportunity to ensure that the implementation of the project brings as much work as possible to the local people in Slavutich , the nearby town where most of the workers involved at the plant live .
It is absolutely right for the report to urge the Commission to examine TACIS funds in this respect .
Huge amounts of energy could be saved in that country .
It is a fact that the United States demands respect from others for the laws of competition and the free market , whilst reserving for itself the right to violate them .
The Agreement does not cover mergers and concentration .
Madam Vice @-@ President , ladies and gentlemen of the Australian delegation , on behalf of the Members of our institution , I welcome you to the European Parliament .
Like Mo , I would like to express my deep gratitude for your solidarity and for your encouragement .
Of course , the two governments who are represented here today and in particular the two people who are representing them who have been involved in very detailed work during the talks leading to the agreement have put enormous efforts into it , together with previous governments who have also made very strong moves towards peace in our country .
The future of Northern Ireland and its ultimate destiny lie firmly in the hands of those who live and reside within Northern Ireland .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am pleased to be able to present to you today the new European Group on ethics , science and new technologies , which takes over from the advisory body on the ethics of biotechnology .
Mr President , I would like to thank President Santer for his personal involvement in this issue .
Now we await this weekend the Council &apos;s appointment of a candidate for the Presidency of the European Central Bank , and we hope that the candidate will be appointed for the full eight years of office , as stipulated in the Treaty .
We have never supported that and we are happy to see that the euro is starting off on a very broad base .
Fortunately , we can see that the first phase of the neoliberal monetarist project has largely begun to flag .
That is why the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations is calling on the Council to take a global view of the situation and not to be limited by financial criteria , as stipulated in Article 109j of the Treaty .
As freely elected members of Parliament , we will be its partners in dialogue .
Indeed , we should not now be concentrating on 2 May , but on what lies ahead after that date .
One of the important objectives of the Amsterdam Summit and also of the Luxembourg Summit was to create coordination , a balance , between macroeconomic policy and employment policies .
Up to now , the fundamentals of economic policy have required nothing from any Member State .
That is why coherent structural policies must be pursued .
Firstly , the question by Mrs Soltwedel @-@ Schäfer .
In its communication , the Commission unfortunately follows the employers &apos; recommendations , since its proposals aim at improving the competitiveness of companies , essentially , and finally , by putting pressure on the cost of labour and by developing flexibility , a solution which has been proved ineffective , as tax gifts also have .
We all know that as long as practical and theoretical training are not integrated - and this may eventually come about - for the time being they are at least complementary access points .
That in turn led to the establishment of a high @-@ level panel of experts on the freedom of movement of persons chaired by Mrs Simone Weil .
This is just a start , a very small start , and it must be followed up in due course by further proposals .
The report recognizes pragmatically the realities of a very recently introduced divorce law in Ireland and also historical realities which relate to the annulment of marriages and agreements with the Holy See .
Because in Singapore , as you know , the Committee on Trade and Environment ( CTE ) report was not even ratified , and if there is no declaration in May it will mean another year will be wasted on discussions at official level .
We hope that the approval of this directive can be finalized this year , so that from 2002 the selection can be made according to this new directive , as planned .
To make matters even worse : in Northampton , alone , the area that was affected was a socially deprived one where people basically have very little insurance coverage .
In that respect , I think the Commission &apos;s proposal is good and well @-@ balanced , because it protects those economic interests but without restricting people &apos;s rights .
This we also find in the directive .
Nevertheless , the opening up to liberalization is progressive and not as strong as the Commission initially proposed .
As regards the amendment on the submission of a report after the directive has been in force for three years , I would like to say that the European Commission is willing to accept this amendment if Parliament considers it to be really necessary .
Not only is there no money - because there really is not - but , as we are always saying in the Energy Committee , where we talk about renewable energy every day , all we are being presented with by the Commission are good intentions far removed from reality .
Comrades and colleagues in this Parliament , we need public support for the European Union .
Vote for my amendment .
On the other hand , I had already given the floor to one or two people and I was feeling very uneasy in the face of your request .
Yet I am saying &quot; No &apos; to the transition to the euro , as it currently stands , and to Mr von Wogau &apos;s report because the minimum democratic and social guarantees are not fulfilled , and because the overall balance presented at Maastricht is not being adhered to .
This also emerges from the report , which speaks of a &quot; stepped @-@ up coordination of tax systems and rates &apos; .
Gasòliba I Böhm report ( A4 @-@ 0133 / 98 )
Their extremely restrictive attitude during the Kyoto Conference on climate change clearly illustrates this wish .
From tomorrow , the euro will give the internal market its full meaning , by eliminating transaction costs , putting an end to speculation , improving price transparency and strengthening financial integration .
Never before have so many countries striven of their own free will to reach the same targets at the same time and with such success .
We are also very concerned about the simultaneous establishment of a European Central Bank independent of political guidelines and without any real democratic control , and which by its very nature will sacrifice economic growth and employment if there is the slightest hint of inflation .
Mr President , I am a little anxious : will the advent of the euro signal an increase in the nineteen million unemployed living in the Union ? Yet I really feel we can achieve that goal , which we have been pursuing since the end of the 1960s , and I hope that the single currency will become the starting point for finally achieving political union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in giving their definitive consent to the changeover to the single currency , maybe there are some of you who will believe that they are voting in favour of the European Union ?
Today the European Union has taken a decisive political step for the future of our continent and is showing the way for the other great regions of the world , a way of drawing together , of overcoming the nationalist tendencies that bring conflict and war .
Since the necessary conditions have been fulfilled , the euro is clearly strengthened and made more credible by being adopted from the start by most of the countries of Europe , both north and south .
In my opinion the Commission and the Council have not yet addressed this issue to a sufficient extent .
This interventionist orthodoxy cultivates the naïve hope of breaking up the nation states from within .
Nor has it ever obstructed the two branches of Parliament and , above all , it has never used the increased tax burden as an argument for stirring up hostility in our country against the construction of Europe .
Swedish opinion has also been developing in a positive direction .
Lower interest rates which is good news for small and medium sized enterprises .
In view of the oft @-@ quoted &quot; globalization of the world economy &apos; , this would be a real mistake , for such a development would only produce further tensions and rifts , both within the EU as well as around the world .
It is working people , the unemployed , and the most vulnerable groups in our societies who will be , as always , the ones who suffer when this leaky vessel disappears beneath the icy waters of economic reality .
A simple multiplication shows that the cost of introducing the euro for European agriculture should be of the order of ECU 1 billion , more than FF 6 billion .
At a time when the nations have just freed themselves at least from the blocs which had tried to break them up , why try to create , in the form of the euro area , a &quot; new type of empire &apos; , according to Mr Moscovici &apos;s formula in Aix @-@ la @-@ Chapelle , a new bloc , in other words , a new source of division and confrontation in Europe ?
Economic and Monetary Union will lead to a federalized Europe .
This Parliament increasingly represents the citizens of Europe .
Do we really want to destroy the financial basis of this research ?
In the forthcoming negotiations on this agreement , the European Union must work towards safeguarding the interests of developing countries , and this House must ensure that in these negotiations , the Commission has a clear position in favour of the Convention on Biodiversity and a fair distribution of income from the wealth of nature in the developing countries .
Madam President , for ethical reasons the Group of the European Radical Alliance is opposed to any form of patenting of human beings or any of their biomolecular elements .
In the pharmaceutical research sector , only 15 % of patents are of European origin whereas 65 % come from America .
You can bring the debate here to an end with the vote , but in society the debate and the political and moral arguments about this issue will continue all the more vigorously .
It is only for that reason that the Commission does not believe it is necessary to mention this aspect .
As is known , the abolition of Article 20 of the second banking directive was recommended by the SLIM task force for banking questions and the Commission supported the recommendation in its report to the Council .
We are very grateful to the Conciliation Committee which , under the admirable chairmanship of Mrs Fontaine , has devoted time and attention to this matter .
Consumption , however , has not decreased .
Perhaps the Commission should come up with a recommendation to file a complaint against putting the family in many Member States at a material , moral and even fiscal disadvantage .
I would therefore like to repeat that there is no problem with regard to the legal basis of this report . This was , moreover , confirmed by Parliament &apos;s legal service in an opinion dated 27 March 1998 , although even the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights would have had us believe otherwise .
When the scientists presented it with the results of the study , which clearly showed that nicotine is addictive , the company destroyed the study and dismantled the laboratory .
So it is dangerous to smoke a cigarette but to smoke a joint is evidently good for your health .
Half a million people are dying of smoking @-@ related diseases while the EU supports 135 000 tobacco producers !
If you want a recommendation , that will not ban tobacco advertising either , because you cannot square a recommendation with the idea of common rules for the internal market .
I regard the reference to seeking an alternative legal basis as something of a red herring so far as this proposal is concerned .
I await an apology from you , and if that is not forthcoming , then we all know what to think !
Any other interpretation would lead to substantially undermining the procedure in question due to the continuous expansion of cross @-@ border services .
Work pioneered at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh ( in my constituency ) is a good example .
Indeed , 83 % of genetic diversity is to be found in Africa , Latin America and Asia , and this is a source of enormous profits when combined with traditional knowledge about the use of this biological diversity which has been acquired by the indigenous people and local communities in these regions .
Nevertheless , many young people fall victim to these substances .
On that point we actually agree with the majority position on the Committee of the Environment , and prefer the earlier position taken by Parliament in the House at first reading .
The Commission has proposed 15 years , and this has been accepted by the Council .
The working group on this did not recommend an hourly limit figure but I believe it is more realistic to try to reduce excedences than to go for the drastically lower limit value that some colleagues want .
They are a major step forward .
The rapporteur has also mentioned other effects of acidifying emissions , the effects on health , for example .
Mr President , first of all , my thanks go to the rapporteur , Mr Poggiolini .
Those extra 60 000 tickets are now being made available to citizens of the European Union and that is a bright spot .
And there have been two notable examples of this .
The objective must be that the measures introduced to protect the euro will act as an equally strong deterrent in all the Member States .
In any case , you have our support on this question , as Mr Camisón Asensio said . I invite you to reply to his supplementary question .
However , beyond this , a feature which governs this Commission communication is its generality , its lack of detail .
And , finally , if the Union recognizes the primary importance of education , it must express that recognition by means of firm political decisions which will enable it to be successfully implemented .
Mr President , the report we are now dealing with leads us into a very important discussion of principles .
But I believe that apart from regulations , which are often difficult to apply internationally , educational efforts , as highlighted by Philip Whitehead , are vital .
Because of its population , size and strategic nature , Mexico - which , under President Zedillo , is immersed in an unfinished process of reforms - is one of the powers of the American continent , and is a real bridge between the United States and Central America . It is also a privileged port of entry for all those foreign investments anxious to establish themselves in the emerging market of Latin America .

There are of course sensitive areas , such as tobacco , alcohol and agriculture .
Finally , the future single monetary policy will be shaped by the European System of Central Banks , not by the European Central Bank and its Executive Board alone .
Every teacher knows that the most brilliant pupils do not always achieve the most brilliant careers , and we all know of less able pupils who have later turned into real high @-@ fliers .
Mr Duisenberg , Mr Issing , Mr Padoa @-@ Schioppa and Mrs Hämäläinen gave clear answers in writing and / or orally , and made it convincingly clear in the time available that they were well to excellently qualified for their job .
Madam President , before we held the hearings with the candidates for the European Central Bank last week , we obviously already knew that , legally speaking , we had no veto right against the candidates .
Some have spoken out and then gone silent .
However , this historic event was overshadowed by the debate on the future President of the European Central Bank .
It is good that these cooperation programmes have been relaunched on a new basis .
The Council has , however , no power to interfere in the internal procedures for ratification by those Member States .
It is no secret that at the moment ECU 400 million from the Algerian budget heading , the Mediterranean protocols and the new MEDA programme have been frozen .
I then intervened in the part @-@ session to say that this could only mean that everything compatible with the already accepted amendments had been adopted .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
If only six or seven countries were to have joined up to the new currency then this would have only resulted in the building of a two @-@ speed Europe .
However , this is a completely different issue from the position of tobacco in the common agricultural policy .
As a consumer I have the right to know which products are on the market and what these products offer .
Having made the above statement of principle , we now have a choice . We have a choice between a society in which freedom - of the strongest and most fortunate - is a doctrine and not an achievement used to protect the most vulnerable , and a society in which accountability is a political asset , even if it threatens some financial interests .
We have recommended this exceptional measure at the request of many personalities in Chiapas , and in Mexico , for the same reasons that I described to this House , on 15 January , the day after the terrible massacres in Acteal .
However , there are no signs that this is likely to be achieved in the near future .
I should like to take this opportunity to reiterate some of my concerns about the Commission &apos;s Agenda 2000 proposal .
Presently , negotiations are being conducted with the five plus one , and there will probably be further pressures on security .
Do the Member States constituting the European Union today have the will to move forwards towards the establishment of a truly independent common defence policy ? General de Gaulle &apos;s European Europe ?
I too believe that he would have liked , would have tried to do much more than he succeeded in doing in the end , and that it was therefore extremely difficult for him to arrive at this point with results that are , honestly speaking , modest from the point of view of whoever considers this issue - common defence policy - an essential point , if Europe is not just thought of as the Europe of the single currency .
Major enlargement of the EU would in all probability reduce the degree of unity between the EU and NATO , thereby reinforcing the need for defence cooperation within the EU .
Mr Tindemans and Mr Titley wish to manufacture weapons a long way from the front for those who will have to fight there whenever , according to the report , the basic principles of the EU are made a laughing stock of .
On the other hand , as has been mentioned , one improvement to the Amsterdam Treaty was realized on the initiative of Sweden and Finland , namely the inclusion of the Petersberg tasks .
Unlike many commentators on this subject , Minister , I personally am not surprised .
I will therefore encourage the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy to consider that current circumstances are no longer conducive to strengthening the partnership ; on the contrary , they must lead to a temporary halt in the process until India has permanently stopped carrying out nuclear tests , has signed and ratified the Non @-@ Proliferation and Comprehensive Test Ban Treaties and has begun to contribute actively towards improving relations between states in the region , more specifically with Pakistan .
Then the international community will be left with two choices .
The next item is questions to the Council ( B4 @-@ 0464 / 98 ) .
I should like to ask the President @-@ in @-@ Office whether at the conference , which as he said , is going to create such an agency , consideration will also be given to safety inside the aircraft .
I say to the honourable Member that I was not aware of that decision , but it is something that will be taken into account by the Council in its deliberations .
Thank you very much , Mr Henderson .
Nevertheless , in Algeria it is being sought , in the Western Sahara it is absent , in the Middle East it is essentially a spectator , and in Cyprus it is politically downgrading its original constructive involvement . Towards Turkey at times it takes &quot; a tough stance &apos; without any obvious effect , and at other times it tolerates the unacceptable interference of this country in the internal issues of the European Union , such as with the recent singular veto which Turkey imposed on Community programmes on islands inhabited by Greeks .
It is also important to discuss the competitiveness of European industry because it provides the basis on which we build a large part of our prosperity .
None of these will be impressed by a rigid and unrealistic European &apos; social model &apos; , which may be based on the best wording ( idealistically speaking ) of the Treaty and other texts , but which does not put into practice the entrepreneurial dynamism that is essential to creating jobs . Otherwise , there will be a negative general reaction to something it is important to safeguard , namely the correct European social model .
The legal framework should be flexible and adaptable .
I believe the fifth framework programme could also play an important part on that point .
It is perhaps even more significant that large sections of the report agree with the positions which the Commission has so far put forward , and this is important because in the debate about regulations we must speak with one voice with other trade partners and competitors if we are to succeed .
Amendment No 3 concerns the freedom of establishment of a service operator .
Everyone would be able to interpret it as they wished .
There are a number of other important areas that still remain outside the democratic control of the European Parliament .
But this is what is going to happen with the draft Treaty of Amsterdam , which the majority of this Parliament approves , but which will reduce democracy in Europe and deprive the national parliaments of their powers without offering any equivalent democratic control .
The European Parliament , on the other hand , has been created &quot; from above &apos; , and its tragedy is that it really lacks a civil foundation .
I therefore request everybody to respect their speaking time strictly , and I will remind people of this where necessary .
In effect , this diversity of opinion prepares the public for an understanding of what is at stake .
It is that flexibility that has enabled him to complete this report , which deals with a highly important subject for all the Union &apos;s institutions .
It will provide an opening to other businesses through the network of 232 centres throughout the European countries .
Your attitude is completely stupid .
The realization of a common defence policy has been removed from the agenda for a long time , to come as a result of the Amsterdam Treaty .
The adoption of the euro - whose entry into force will certainly represent an asset for European companies finally freed from the substantial administrative and financial costs of the exchange rate - will help to improve their financial environment .
The Sudanese government has an appalling record of ruthless repression in north and south alike , apart from its military operations : imprisonment , torture , execution and the use of terrorism against its own and neighbouring peoples .
In 1995 this Parliament refused all assistance .
Peace in Guatemala also marked the culmination of a process of pacification throughout Central America .
Turkey wants to join the European Union , and it could well be that there were a few hitches - and in my view there certainly were - in the talks which were held primarily with the Council last autumn .
Sale of human organs in China
But I repeat , whatever happens in the elections , no matter who wins the Colombian elections , the first priority is to seek peace , which will require major negotiations . From then on , the priority will be gradually to reduce the current tension in that country , which gives rise to the situations we have seen there recently , which are so hard to understand .
Arms brokers and end use will require close monitoring .
Anyone who saw it on television - and a great many people did see it , not only nationally but throughout Europe - could see great despair in the eyes of those people , but also great dignity . That is perhaps what most struck the journalists , who have become used to grief and profound sorrow .
We are also against the motion to institutionalize the informal working group on information policy between Parliament and the Commission .
Time is short , but the guiding principles for agreements in the air travel sector are of fundamental importance , in my opinion , and we need to have more contact on matters such as this .
There are four major systems in the European Union , and one of them has a market share of more than 70 % in 10 of the 15 Member States .
Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on both reports .
Proposing to those countries undergoing transition that they apply measures which are in line with the objectives of this and other programmes , whose aim is to promote an environmentally friendly agricultural industry , therefore seems to me to be eminently sensible .
Systematic theft or the systematic counterfeiting of credit cards , for example , should also be included .
In short , the Commission welcomes this proposal for a joint action .
Nevertheless , the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry should never compromise or put at risk the health of human beings .
In April 1998 , in relation to the subject of resistance development , the Commission &apos;s Scientific Steering Committee agreed on the appointment of an inter @-@ disciplinary working group which will probably submit relevant findings at the end of this year .
It is also very important that we switch to a less intensive breeding programme that is less dependent on the prolonged use of medicinal products .
The debate is closed .
As regards the failure to differentiate qualitatively in the export refunds , the Commission points out that healthy and normal commercial quality is the only available criterion for export refunds , so that there was no case for any more detailed differentiation .
I think this is a very good example of how combined heat and power could be promoted in the European Union . I call on the Commission to resist the lobbying by oil companies which are naturally not in favour of cogeneration because it will reduce the amount of fuel they sell .
I have to tell you that I think that both the President and the Bureau have behaved in a really irresponsible way in this matter and that such behaviour leads to mistrust on our part .
That is a tremendous quantum leap for Europe .
The plans , of course , will vary from one Member State to another but it is important for us all to recognize the need for common themes among our various approaches .
There has been an abundance of subjects for initiatives and events during your Presidency , as Mr David has said .
I wish them continued success for the next couple of weeks and that Cardiff will be like the finishing of the Grand National , as was said by Mr Titley .
While there is far less that government can do to stop people losing their last job , there is a lot more that government should do to help people gain their next job .
It is to encourage them to have a foreign policy worthy of the name in the first place .
There have been other areas where I could have wished that we could have achieved a more robust and a more united approach .
I should like to know the Council &apos;s view .
There are also EU representatives in Bosnia and the Middle East . Furthermore , they are there all the time , not just when the television cameras are there , and they even try to act with a certain amount of consistency .
It is indeed the case that when we have the planning and early warning unit and when we have the High Representative in place , we will have a better mechanism for giving expression to the common positions we adopt .
How can we assure the positive impact that we are aiming for ?
Madam President , I would like to express the grave concern of my group over the state of the negotiations between the Union and South Africa .
In the event that more flexibility is shown by the South Africans - and I hope that will be the case - on the basis of the Council discussions on this matter at an earlier stage this year the Commission has some flexibility to be able to respond to any initiative which might be forthcoming from our South African colleagues .
Madam President , this proposal by the European Commission is confirmation and proof positive of the hardline , in our view , single @-@ minded approach which colours all Union policy and which is perfectly illustrated in the Stability Agreement , the application of which is already speeding up apace .
Otherwise you will not arrive at a serious , integrated and balanced approach .
But since the legal experts and diplomats were not always sufficiently bold or particularly pushy , what did they achieve ?
However , as regards the consequences of the Amsterdam Treaty and the enlargement policy , we have taken into account , within responsibly reduced limits , the Parliament &apos;s need for more adequate human resources .
My point is that I am pressing for a political reaction from our President , given that the press out there which is full of suppositions and insinuations is demanding answers which have to be given by every Member of this House .
I hope that the Commissioner can also give his opinion on that , although of course it falls within the remit of his colleague , Mr Monti .
Commissioner , I think that a very important element in this report is the Europe test , or a vetting process to determine what disadvantages frontier workers might experience as a result of new legislation passed or new decisions taken in Member States .
That will unfortunately still not tell you who is the owner of the vehicle , but we shall at least know who is the authorised owner of the registration documents .
In the long run they are probably the salvation of industries like this one .
They are sources of innovation potential .
The world would not understand such a lack of vision and the future would not forgive us for it .
The hallmark of Structural Fund administration is sluggishness and bureaucracy .
I should like to point out that certain island regions already have a distinct , special treatment . These are the ultra @-@ peripheral regions , which are already recognized , even in the new text of the Treaty of Amsterdam , in Article 299 ( 2 ) of the modified text .
The Cohesion Fund is not a regional fund and its functions must therefore be assessed in terms of the Cohesion Fund regulation .
This week the results of the working party &apos;s discussion on MEPs &apos; pay , travel and other expenses will be made known here .
But we could also vote on Thursday .
The Union has a powerful instrument in its hands with the human rights clause , and should also wish to use it .
Mr President and Members of the House , it is clear that during the course of the debate a number of issues have been touched on that go beyond the strict terms of the second interim report of Mrs Aelvoet .
But we cannot always apply restrictions in the area of biotechnology or we will never be able to catch up in this area .
Concerning the requirement in the amendment to present a report on experience with the directive , the Commission considers that the aim of the amendment could be achieved by making available to Parliament the report it is required to produce under Article 18 ( 3 ) .
We must finally learn that animals are living creatures and not commodities .
Mr President , I would like to say that I agree with the report .
With this protocol , the Commission recognizes the action taken since 1996 by the Guinean Government to ensure overall control of access stocks and to develop the battle against illegal fishing and marine research .
Unlike other major agricultural product areas , the common organization of the market in wine has not been reformed for 15 years .
A set @-@ aside rate of 10 % would also comply in principle with this request .
The truth is , that without European Union subsidies there would be no tobacco industry in Europe .
It does not do this and that is why it is a sham .
And I think it is good to be bold when it comes to investigating new uses and varieties of tobacco .
The Union &apos;s citizens do not want to finance the growing of this harmful crop .
This is exactly the point that affects our voters , the people who put us in this House and who , not being farmers , increasingly fail to understand this system of financing .
A strategy of attack has yet to be defined , and the agricultural policy reform proposed by the Commission does not take that important international deadline into consideration .
I am very concerned at the proposal for national envelopes because I believe that will bring inequalities between Member States .
Another important point ( Amendments Nos 4 and 9 ) makes it compulsory for operators to obtain insurance cover for the contained use of GMMs .
We believe all forms of official support for tobacco production should be phased out .
Agenda 2000 extends EU aid to forestry .
On enlargement and Agenda 2000 I finally wish to say that it is not worth prolonging the discussion as long as the institutional problems in the EU today remain unresolved .
With regard to agriculture , its proposals are confined to reducing the prices of arable crops , milk , beef and veal in order to maintain a socalled balance , by providing partial compensation , theoretically enabling farmers to adapt to these price reductions .
And I wonder , how many decimal places of GNP are we talking about ?
The first is that enlargement is only possible if the agricultural and structural policies are reformed .
Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs Schroedter on her report , and tell her that the best thing about the report - and she should not be upset by this - is that it is indebted to the proposals made by the Commission , and specifically the Commissioner here with us today , Mrs Wulf @-@ Mathies .
However , it surprises me that after years of discussion about the necessity of integrated regional development strategies , the integrated approach should suddenly be called into question .
I certainly hope that is so , because the uncertainty created by the ongoing threat of further WTO action would be neither conducive to the proper functioning of the market nor to the ability of ACP and EU growers to adjust to the new arrangements .
Does the Commission consider this draft law to be compatible with the principles which govern the internal market and those enshrined in the European convention protecting personal correspondence ?
Question No 51 by Alexandros Alavanos ( H @-@ 0498 / 98 )
Do the Community programmes for preserving the cultural and architectural heritage include shared funding for the repair of the damage to the Monemvassia bridge so that they may make a contribution to the urgent action needed to preserve an important monument from the Byzantine period ?
So we have an agreement .
As for the licence regime , we fully agree with the views expressed in the report , where it says the reference period should be taken as the shortest and most recent period for which data exist .
I must say , Commissioner , that this time , in general terms , we share the views expressed in the Commission proposal , because we need to modify the current import licence regime and make it compatible with WTO rules .
I congratulate the rapporteur and welcome this common position .
To go without research today means being less efficient and competitive tomorrow .
I would like to ask the Commission to devote special attention to this subject , not because I believe the Fifth Framework Programme for Research can solve the problem - there is far too little money for that .
I had previously commissioned a study and I had consulted the Member States , who were able to organize their representatives into three working groups .
If political will is combined with political creativity at Union level and at national and regional political levels and channelled into new energy sources , doubling looks set to be achieved before 2010 - I am sure of that .
Renewable energy sources are also worth striving for to conserve resources and promote future export business .
This example shows that the draft directive has not quite taken shape .
The proposed amendments naturally take account of the Commission objective , which consists in strengthening the possibilities of effecting controls along the external borders of the Community .
The previous speaker said he expected more demands by the European Parliament .
That seems to me to be the most important point in political terms !
Lastly , the European position on the peace process has not changed .
A particularly striking example is the Commission initiative to exclude products from Jewish settlements from the preferential trade conditions applying to Israel .
We in the Union should block our existing agreements with Israel and promote all efforts to help the Palestinian National Authority .
That position is enshrined in the conclusions which were agreed at Cardiff yesterday ; if they have not already been circulated they will be very shortly .
Owing to circumstances , this aid is increasingly concentrated on the development of support structures for the Palestinian Authority which , unfortunately , is interpreted as a sort of anticipation of the peace process and consequent recognition of a still doubtful State whose borders remain , at the very least , to be defined .

Gerard Collins has accordingly been elected Vice @-@ President .
Mr Collins , instructions have been given .
Europe profited from its many colonies in such countries in the past , so it is only right that today &apos;s Europe give a hand @-@ up to people in the poorest parts of the world who want to earn an honest living .
In think decisions concerning energy policy should be taken at national level .
We are not going to be driven out .
Mr President , the situation in Kosovo is untenable and unacceptable .
That is why , in spite of all the difficulties , we must now seek a clear UN mandate .
He has no such right either in international law or in human law .
Outside the laboratory the patient must be able to understand the instructions easily in order to avoid all possible error in the use of the test .
We hope that the setting up of a European database , which also springs from a suggestion made by Parliament , will contribute towards this .
Other countries have high nominal rates and , on the other hand , they offer a low effective tax rate for business through special reliefs and allowances , some of which are not so transparent .
The transition to the country of origin principle should be completed as quickly as possible .
An early warning system will , we hope , help in the short term but if that was the solution then there would be no need for the long @-@ term computerized way of tackling the problem .
To my mind , it is wasteful to pay out £ 10 , 000 to remove a window in order to get a car into a building , followed by another £ 10 , 000 to get it out again .
When the Council considers this matter further , all these issues will be taken into account .
Does it give the right of autonomy to some people but not to others ?
I look forward to the Austrian presidency .
However , we must under no circumstances allow ourselves to close our eyes to the economic reality of the European Union .
I would like to look at this matter more in terms of principle .
One closing comment : I rank amongst those who favour getting rid of the unanimity rule on taxation questions because , if I may say so , it would boost this Parliament &apos;s decision @-@ making role .
The proposal does not address selection criteria for licences or the pricing of the licensed frequency spectrum - which is not its purpose anyway - because the freedom of the Member States must be respected in this field .
There is no need to commission a study and we will soon be suggesting , in a statement to Parliament , how the various options available can be used to develop a sensible frequency policy .
I think that is regrettable .
Objective testing and transparency must be guaranteed immediately and where abuse occurs , legal measures must be taken immediately .
Mr President , as you all know , we had a debate last night on the Commission &apos;s statement about nuclear transport .
( Applause ) In recent months , too , the European Union has secured a more prominent role in the Middle East peace process .
I am convinced this will yield a positive result .
In the remaining days of your presidency , we look to you to ensure that the words &apos; a people &apos;s Europe &apos; have some tangible and lasting resonance through this action .
Finally , I would like to thank Mr Henderson and Mrs Clare Short for their willingness to accord consultative powers to the European Parliament in respect of expansion and the Lomé Convention , amongst other things ; support for the strengthening of this Parliament means indeed support for the strengthening of democracy and closer ties with the citizens .
That is why we need more rights for this Parliament , that is so say more majority decisions at European level .
These institutional digressions are not meant to reassure the citizens , who cannot make sense of it .
First of all I offer my congratulations to those who have stayed the course during our debate this morning which I have very greatly enjoyed hearing .
Their objectives are all the same anyway .
It is not a question of bringing to the fore the negative results following the implementation of the reform in 1992 , but rather of establishing a consistent and clear framework regarding European policy guidelines for agriculture , within the context of Agenda 2000 .
I welcome the main lines of the Schroedter report on economic and social cohesion in the context of the Agenda 2000 proposals .
Any attempt to have fundamental decisions made at the remotest point , that is , Brussels , actually means removing powers from a near and living democracy in order to transfer them to an artificial , distant democracy .
A fast , efficient and easily accessible mobile network offering services like a reliable Internet connection can help meet the needs of individuals , businesses and other organizations in the coming years .
But China , too , should adopt a more conciliatory attitude in this particularly vulnerable region .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen Members of this House , the Commission is extremely preoccupied by the recent military confrontations which have occurred on the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia .
In a farcical trial , 15 people have been sentenced to death in Equatorial Guinea and 117 people have been judged and also given varying sentences , in addition to being tortured .
Moreover , the people involved are minority groups , who are already under pressure in Chad in this respect , and repression is increasing . Comparison with the Nigerian problem , namely in Okoni land and the arrest and death of the Ken Saro Wiwa , cannot be avoided .
The blasphemy law should not just be toned down , but abolished .
Our progress is a slap in the face for all Realpolitik which believes that morality and justice are irrelevant in foreign policy .
I am unlikely to be complacent since I will ultimately have the responsibility to give the EU &apos;s position on that election .
To conclude , I would also like to express my conviction that the emergence of renewable energy sources and the unfettered deployment of a genuine programme of stable development together constitute a source for jobs of all types and all grades .
The Commission proposals and the report by Mr Secchi seek to remove the barriers to satisfactory operation of the single market .
We have been constantly reinforced in this view by the scientists .
Moreover , it is our opinion that a reduction of the by @-@ catch currently permissible in sand eel fishing at sea is a viable proposition and is something which should therefore be made law .
Indeed this gave us in the West of Scotland a particular problem . There is an area called &apos; the wee bankie &apos; , where some Danish and Scottish fishermen almost came to blows at the end of last year over the fishing activities that were going on there .
Firstly , several phenomena on the market in fisheries products run counter to the efforts to conserve fish stocks , on which the future of the whole fishing industry is dependent .
This policy has had particularly negative effects on coastal and small @-@ scale fisheries , which show reduced levels of production and employment as well as a reduction in their share of the total fish market , to the benefit of large @-@ scale fishing industries .
I believe that the report is very honest and reveals the problems facing the sector .
Hence , a number of criteria , quite clear in their purpose , have already been defined with regard to sardines and tuna .
Finally , Mr President , I should like to remind the House that the fish product canning industry is highly diversified and not limited to the above two sectors of activity .
However , I would like to tell you clearly that the producers of olive oil cannot understand that , while in other sectors of the CAP there do not seem to be any budgetary problems , in this sector , in spite of the contribution the olive sector makes towards combating erosion and desertification and in spite of its contribution to employment and to keeping the population in the countryside , the Commission &apos;s proposals go in the opposite sense .
A ruling must be found , however , whereby sensible , verifiable and economically acceptable support is possible .
Commissioner , please listen to me .
Farmers will not accept such incoherence .
The information society is a lot more than just fast communications links ; nevertheless , without fast connections people &apos;s patience runs out .
This , of course , could not have been done earlier .
I have told you already that we have been able to clear budget lines which amount to approximately ECU 240m .
It has not been mentioned this afternoon but I believe it is not as sympathetic to us as we might want .
It wishes to play a positive role in the peace process and will , therefore , be an important participant in any future negotiations .
The most important question relates to the peace process .
The draft spatial planning document has now made progress , thanks to the push given by both the British ministers and indeed the group of experts .
Anything that can be done locally should be .
Quite the opposite . Diversification can offer new opportunities for the promotion of our cultural and natural heritage , as well as the development of rural tourism affecting small- and medium @-@ sized firms and craft industries .
In that connection , it is also essential that we train social workers and partners and campaign against xenophobic and racist activities .
This is in line with the Commission &apos;s intention to embark on new programmes of action .
Why should the Commission be trying to decide details such as this ?
Individuals who have bought their quantity of duty @-@ free alcohol or cigarettes in the airport have no difficulty in obtaining another lot on board the aeroplane .
Secondly , ending duty @-@ free will create unemployment .
The rise in costs and transportation difficulties will also mean an increase in costs to the export industry , affecting its competitiveness and , indirectly , employment .
I am most grateful for that .
More attention paid to European symbols or to our shared history will certainly help us , but we are in urgent need of restoring the confidence of the citizen in Europe .
Nor has it really been grasped by the people who decreed it or by our citizens or by my colleagues . Many of my colleagues have not actually realized this yet either .
In finishing , I wish to congratulate Mr Schmid and my coo @-@ draftsmen on their contribution to the issue of the safe use of the Internet , and to thank them for supporting the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
That is why we are calling for a strategic policy to be formulated at this point , and not a reactive policy that could cost us much more in ten years &apos; time .
On the other hand , first and foremost the European Union must set up a framework of guarantees and constitutional standards within which union rights at a European level can blossom fully .
It is absolutely essential that we enshrine in European law the right to join trade unions and the right to bargain collectively .
All of us must be concerned with the continuing decline of rural populations , the deteriorating age profile of our farmers and the real threat to the traditional family farm .
This sort of situation still exists and maybe more than we think .
Mr President , I support Mr Chanterie &apos;s proposal to ask the Commission to submit a proposal to amend the working time directive .
This calls for comment . In the report that we are about to approve there are proposals to increase Community support for fair trade projects , not only to educate people about development , which is certainly an important aspect , but also to provide direct support to producer organizations .
Nonetheless , I hope that common trade with third world countries , including the fair trade discussed here , continues to develop in a positive way , and I also hope that the Commission will continue to support us in this .
As the report underlines , no @-@ one is proposing to set the world of the town against the world of the countryside , but we must support a development process which limits the rural desertification process which affects most of the Member States .
The driving force behind the document &apos; Europe 2000 &apos; , approved by the Committee of the Regions , is wholly appropriate .
The artificial prolongation of duty @-@ free regulations as a roundabout way of achieving long term clarification of grey areas , as set out in Amendment No 29 , is considered by the large majority of my group to be much too vague and indirect as well as being unfair and inefficient .
In our view , teaching pupils about European history and culture is excellent , and voluntary coordination between European countries and their schools and teachers centred around particular subjects is also an excellent idea .
It is also a sector of activity which desperately needs recognition of its usefulness , but while it may sometimes need only a little to encourage it , it can also be all too easily discouraged .
It is somewhat strange that at a time when the WTO denies Member States of the European Union and the Union itself the right to grant trade preferences which are designed as development aid , we are forced to operate this type of policy indirectly , via hypothetical actions in favour of consumers .
That is not what matters now .
You know that , according to the Treaty of Amsterdam , the issue of policy regarding third @-@ country nationals will in future be subject to Community law , and that this issue was moved from the third pillar to the first pillar .
It must be stated and repeated - because the worst kind of deaf person is someone who does not want to hear - that the OECD has recognized that there is no close correlation between the influxes of foreigners into a country and changes in the level of unemployment .
In the Union there is no right of immigration and establishment , and it must also be possible to draw up common rules relating to the asylum procedure .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have heard some points made here today by Mr Pirker and Mr Nassauer which I would have liked to reply to in person , but these gentlemen preferred to move on to other activities , following their vigorous words .
Fundamentalism which exists in all sorts of religions internationally has been referred to , and rightly so - as Mr Colajanni rightly says , as a sort of misunderstanding .
Bearing in mind the diversity of the different Islamic tendencies , the radical trends must be clearly distinguished from those which do not question the values of freedom and democracy in any way whatsoever .
There is also a worthwhile coordination with the help of various working groups which have been established within both the second and third pillars .
What is the point of making technical and economic analyses if no changes can be implemented , even though the records show them to be beneficial ?
In accordance with the employment policy guidelines , it is important that Member States should reduce indirect labour costs , particularly those arising from poorly qualified labour .
We have not received any positive reply , apart from long speeches in support of codes of good conduct .
Weaknesses in the sector in Europe have long been due to unfair access to markets .
Mr President , I congratulate my colleague , Mrs Berès , for throwing light on one of the more shadowy organizations of the European Union - the Monetary Committee .
Judging by the way in which audiences are arranged between the Parliament &apos;s committees and various bodies that are far more important than the one we are debating at the moment - and Mrs Randzio @-@ Plath makes reference to this - and judging by the way in which they respond , I have the impression that this will continue . I would also like to see what committee would refuse to appear before the committees of the European Parliament to give an account of decisions it has taken , even if this is not provided for by the Treaty or by anything else .
That is how it was in the European Union when we intervened in the traditional set @-@ up whereby national government contracts were placed nationally : we discovered after a time that the intervention had unintended side effects .
The efforts of the European Parliament were futile and were perhaps at times coloured by political romanticism , since it judged that the political map of Europe could be redrawn - albeit for European elections - with Brussels and Strasbourg at the core .
With this in mind , and in view of the fact that this House , including the Socialists , has indicated its willingness to discuss these issues once more in committee , I am prepared to agree to the amendment being referred back to committee and would ask my group , and indeed all other Members of the House , to comply with Mr Schulz &apos;s proposal .
Our Parliament lacked courage .
The European Commission &apos;s plan of action is well @-@ intentioned , but it is not very specific . It lacks cohesion and precise commitments about funding and a timetable for implementation .
Mr President , one of the new features of the Treaty of Amsterdam is to establish the possibility of this Parliament incorporating common principles for elections to the European Parliament .
Naturally the smaller groups in this House - and this is something which Mr Frischenschlager referred to - wish to drop this qualifying clause .
Therefore that is where rules for elections , including elections to the European Parliament , should be formulated .
Mr President , the history of a civilized society is the story of a succession of battles against repression and discrimination .
I agree with the remarks that were made previously by Mr Papayannakis .
Thus , many young people aged between 18 and 26 years can participate in the work of NGOs , they can enter problem areas , they can perform humanitarian services for others once they have acquired the rudiments of the language of their host country .
I must emphasize - and I make no secret of this even in my capacity as rapporteur - that I would like to see more comprehensive labelling .
It raises the question of how the European Parliament can best deal with such a technical question .
I have always resisted including a mass of detail on labels since this would make the label useless to the consumer .
If not , then the programmes cannot be carried out .
We have studied all the budget lines from this angle .
Her husband and the friend were refused a drink on the grounds that they were &quot; Arabic &apos; .
We are looking into this calculation in some detail .
It is particularly important that environmental policy is included in agricultural policy , and I am very grateful to the Commission that this additional statement on the common agricultural policy has been included in the decision by the Conciliation Committee .
I can also confirm that at the Council meeting in Chester in April , I promised we would come up with a plan of action on chemical substances .
For example , there is a dearth of statistical information , and , given this , I believe the report , in the shape it is in now , will act as a sort of catalogue of those issues that ought to be systematized and considered later on .
He in fact claimed that Mrs Myller wished to increase the tax burden on the Member States .
Water charges for the purpose of ensuring that costs are fully covered are an essential element of this directive , and I hope I can count on your support in the debate on this subject that we can expect to have with the Council .
Work has already begun in this House on a common voting procedure for the European Parliament and on a uniform statute for Members .
We will support every initiative to strengthen trust and cooperation , and we also intend to increase the visibility of the Union in this area .
Well , what kind of image has Europe been projecting these past few months , these past years ?
President Santer hopes that this project will move forward apace under the Austrian presidency .
You have not said a word about the programme for the extraordinary summit , which Parliament is pinning certain hopes on , as it is after all the continuation of a protracted debate .
You said , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , that it will be a presidency dominated by work and not play .
That means that we need a strategy , and Buenos Aires is a good opportunity for it . The presidency is also an opportunity for you to demonstrate that you are capable not just of words , but also of deeds .
( Applause ) We have made some important discoveries .
My inner hope is that those who are now fighting against oppression and for freedom in Kosovo should be driven by the desire not to set group against group , Orthodox against Muslim , Serb against Albanian , that their goal should be to anchor Kosovo into a European community characterized by democracy and respect for every single person .
Because fleeing our responsibilities is no longer an option .
Sustainable development nowadays enjoys a broad consensus in our countries .
Instead I will concentrate on the question of whether this report has any basis in fact .
This report contains the incompletely drafted proposal of the so @-@ called transnational lists for the European elections , and I cannot accept it in this form .
Such a practice would unfairly favour large Member States to the detriment of the small ones .
This is thus an argument for different requirements and timings , or indeed the fact that an energy tax will be a particular burden on transport , and will thus affect the poorest , peripheral countries much more than the others .
This , in turn , will provide the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth .
We do not expect you to do that because we need anonymity in that area .
Therefore , Mr Duisenberg , permit me to say that I was interested to note that your first message to the outside world , to society , stated last week and again here today , constitutes a message of alarm about the rate of deficit reduction , adding that some countries have to be shown the yellow card .
Mr President , the time has come to recall the promises the European Union made to its newest Member States , Austria , Finland and Sweden , when they joined the Union almost four years ago .
The next item is the report ( A4 @-@ 0253 / 98 ) by Mrs Hautala , on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive relating to motor vehicles and their trailers - transporting certain animals and amending directive 70 / 156 / EEC in respect of the type @-@ approval of motor vehicles and their trailers ( COM ( 97 ) 0336 - C4 @-@ 0339 / 97 @-@ 97 / 0190 ( COD ) ) .
In the agricultural industry , as in any other , farmers and livestock dealers have very large vested interests in presenting their product in prime condition in order to command the best possible price .

That is quite simply continued discrimination against homosexuals , despite the fact that this type of cohabitation is permitted in the countries where they originally come from .
Mr President , Mr Macartney , as a result of consultations at the European Ecofin Council on 19 May 1998 , it became apparent that there was no consensus on the question of calling for a Community @-@ wide study into the effects of the abolition of intra @-@ EU duty @-@ free sales on 30 June 1999 .
Mr President , I am doubly grateful to you this evening , for exercising your discretion in this way .
I believe that it is not enough just to have no discrimination .
How are minority rights developing within the various states ?
Therefore , I believe that we must all support that political objective .
Who does not see that closer cooperation goes in the opposite direction , that is , towards what is known as a two @-@ speed Europe or a Europe à la carte ?
We must build our common Europe together .
Abolishing discrimination against third @-@ country nationals cannot wait until we have a Community migration policy .
This must not be allowed .
We should know to what extent the Commission wants to incorporate the wishes of Mrs Weiler - the wishes , I would not say of the whole House but maybe the majority of the House - concerning third country nationals ?
In my opinion , the amendments presented by the Committee on Legal Affairs must be approved in their entirety .
Of these , I would like to very briefly look at No 26 and No 27 .
It is , therefore , essential to link employment and the environment .
We have noted your remarks .
So , despite all the difficulties , it is gratifying that many petitions have nevertheless reached a successful conclusion .
But it is here , in direct contact with the citizens of the European Union , that we find the flaws and limitations of European Union legislation .
It is true that the issue of the languages in which petitions are drawn up is essentially a problem which is Parliament &apos;s responsibility .
The way in which we treat this Special Report can , in a way , create a model for the future .
The Commission supports the view of the report that access to documents is an important element if we want to create increased openness in the Union .
But here again , if there is to be fruitful collaboration , we need partnerships which work well .
I am happy to back this report which seeks to make the petition system in the European Parliament more accessible to our citizens .
I am contacted on a regular basis by people whose holidays have been ruined as a result .
It will not lighten the crushing weight of the two large dominant groups in our Parliament .
1.The acquis communautaire and the proper functioning of the internal market must not be called into question ; 2 .
Extending the scope of those entitled to join migrant workers to include same sex partners , family members regardless of their nationality , family members not living in the migrant worker &apos;s household and those who have more than one spouse or partner , would lead to a flood of immigration with which my small country , more than 37 % of whose population is made up of non @-@ Luxembourg citizens , could simply not cope .
I therefore believe that it is very important to ensure that , at this time , the European Union maintains a firm and demanding position with respect to the authorities in Lagos , and that in no way is any credibility given to the promises made , not even a minimum of credibility .
We do not apply double standards , but perhaps we do look at some countries more closely than others , quite simply because we need and want to have a close relationship with these countries .
I think that it would have been useful to consider the text of the resolutions more fully , all the more so since controversy seems to be centred on the problem of the transmission of just a few results .
I find it particularly regrettable to have to reprimand Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan , but nonetheless I must express my astonishment concerning his condemnation of the boycott policy of the state of Massachusetts .
Well , really !
The forthcoming EC @-@ Vietnam Joint Commission in October will provide the occasion to judge the scope of the September amnesty and in particular to see what consideration has been given to the individuals on the EU list of political detainees .
Madam President , Greece has the painful privilege of being the country where , with each of the many fires that occur , the extent of the damage is greater than anywhere else in Europe .
( Loud applause )
Unless these principles are absorbed into practice , it will be futile to talk of closer ties for the citizens of the Union .
Because the traveller is now insufficiently aware of his legal position , he misses out on compensation .
Amendment No 10 , second and third paragraphs , adds unnecessary bureaucracy and would make the information notices difficult to read , especially for someone like myself who needs the support of glasses on every occasion .
If these guidelines have no central significance , there will be no European cohesion policy .
I believe that Commissioner Bangemann &apos;s initiative for the globalization of the information society and international cooperation , sometimes defined as an initiative for a map of the Internet , moves in this direction .
For the last few years as a frequent traveller with Sabena , I and my fellow passengers have endured lost luggage , delayed flights , tremendously over @-@ booked planes , rude staff - especially in Brussels - incompatible computer systems ( even within one company ) and a level of inconvenience which , if associated with a major retailer , would have produced consumer resistance and bankruptcy a long time ago .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this report has a political significance which transcends the actual content .
Some keywords I see in this include access to information between the Member States , high priority in the form of rapid processing of applications for the seizure , rapid action , personal contacts between investigators , judges , etcetera and simple procedures whilst upholding legal certainty .
Young people from Prague , Budapest and Warsaw are prevented by the division of Europe from taking advantage of training possibilities in London , Paris , Bologna and elsewhere , while young people from the EU are deterred from spending a year in Poland , Romania or the Czech Republic .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
The Commission does not entirely agree with the objectives of Amendment No 6 and , in particular , the reference to small local fishing enterprises , since these fisheries agreements , which are , obviously , commercial in nature , seek to provide fishing opportunities for Community shipowners , while taking into account compatibility with other Community policies and especially development policy .
I would also like to point out that Mrs Theato &apos;s request , made in her capacity as chairman of the Budgetary Control Committee , should give rise to a vote on the request for the Bösch report to be re @-@ entered on the agenda .
The Group of the European People &apos;s Party therefore supports all the amendments from the Committee on Transport , as we have already done in the committee .
Reference is made , for example , to the fundamental characteristic which a utility design or model must have in order to be recognized as such .
It has been on our agenda since as long ago as 1993 .
As far as the adaptation of Community analysis procedures is concerned , we have already committed ourselves to bringing the existing analysis procedures for coffee into line .
We know how difficult it is to have a balanced transatlantic relationship .
Mr President , during this period of financial crisis in both Asia and Russia , we can see the extent to which the United States and Europe are bastions of economic and commercial stability .
I am quite staggered that you do not find all this alarming .
Are there any comments ?
Even so , the Commission has not taken the opportunity to put forward concrete proposals in this area .
Secondly - and this comment is also directed towards the Commission - I am yet again hearing calls from some Member States for export refunds on pigmeat , butter and milk to be increased , to rejuvenate the Russian export market , which is currently in a state of collapse .
Because we must not forget that the Erasmus and Konver programmes , efforts to promote the peace process in Ireland , and so on all started within a framework which we are now trying to adjust by the procedure of legal bases for pilot , preparatory and other similar actions undertaken in the context of the European Union .
I believe that this is a good agreement both for Mr Christodoulou and this House , and for the Commission and the Council .
Mr Wynn and Mrs Müller asked about budget line B @-@ 5321 on the social economy .
That should not happen again .
Mr President , the European Union and the Member States must work closely together and liaise with Europe &apos;s motor and oil industries at all times so as to guarantee that pollution is defeated once and for all in the near future .
The fact that there was nevertheless substantial opposition to the directive is due to the disagreement over freedom to protect designs for spare parts .
The EU must again take the strain in ensuring that we make substantial progress in Buenos Aires , even in some of the difficult areas .
There is a big risk : the threat to biodiversity .
We must also take into account the constraints , realising that production costs can include social dumping and also environmental dumping , but above all take into account the pressure which the consumerism of the North places on this level of the production cost .
This close cooperation continues .
It is an administrative policy instrument which can work well if government is convinced that it makes sense to use it . So it must not be viewed as a bureaucratic nuisance .
In such cases , Mr President , we have a multiplied environmental impact , something more than the simple sum of the effects of each respective project .
The intention was to avoid unnecessary delays in the procedure or further costs arising from the poor quality or lack of information in the environmental assessment .
So what do we have to do ?
Ireland is presently experiencing strong economic growth and part of our resources must be invested in alternative waste management schemes .
The Belgian Government has once again shown that whilst being , &apos; at the heart of Europe &apos; , it is unable to provide nonBelgian nationals with their full voting rights , but it is not the only offender .
This has still not happened .
The problem supposedly lay in the fact that it began too late , and that particularly as far as the media over there were concerned and the political developments in the run @-@ up to the elections , fair conditions were not in place .
In the course of the two years under review , the Danish krone fluctuated against the currencies participating in the exchange rate mechanism , reflecting , among other things , the non @-@ existence of a target exchange rate .
Why ?
If the committee and the Commission cannot reach agreement , the measure at issue may only be approved by the legislative authority , that is to say , under the codecision procedure of the European Parliament and the Council .
It is therefore with the utmost urgency that serious negotiations should be started in order to conclude an interinstitutional agreement in this respect , with this agreement clearly going further than the current modus vivendi which , it must be said , leaves all the comitology procedures as they are .
Their shareholders are not insurance undertakings .
There is no better example of this identification than the present political situation , dominated by the terrifying campaigns of the Taliban and by the horrific news of the continuing bloodbath in Algeria .
Only a knowledge of our actual origins , history and traditions will enable us to understand the values of peace , solidarity and tolerance which constitute the pillars for the construction of Europe .
The European Union is particularly keen to be active , just as it has been since the end of the Soviet system .
What is sometimes lacking , from our Russian partner , is vigorous coordination , capable of providing the political impetus needed to prepare and implement these projects .
However , political crises , although dangerous , can be beneficial when they do not turn into a catastrophe .
Let us launch this second pillar , which is still absent in so many areas and sectors where it could be having an innovative effect , now that it can finally operate outside the traditional blockages paralysing any autonomous European initiative .
Russia is primarily experiencing a crisis of authority , particularly because the political leaders have ignored the people too much .
This is no passing malaise ; it is a crisis rooted in the ultra @-@ liberal approaches that are prevailing throughout the world ; consequently , its impact will become apparent , and indeed already has , in a downturn of growth , demand and employment in our national economies .
So we must not abdicate responsibility .
I believe this government deserves our trust , if only because the head of the government has said that there will be no change to the reforms and that the loans will be repaid .
Above all , a regulatory system must include measures for the compulsory disclosure of financial data of a comparable standard , for transparency in all finance market transactions , for more efficient financial markets , for better supervision by creditors and borrowers , for measures to reduce the volume of short @-@ term borrowing and to curb speculation , as well as incentives for long @-@ term cross @-@ border loan agreements .
With regard to the international economic situation , we must firstly be careful of mistaking the right solutions .
These 12 amendments were all rejected by the Commission .
If this happens , then our colleagues will have been 100 % successful in their task .
I would like to congratulate our rapporteur , Mrs Mosiek @-@ Urbahn , on her work and on all the effort she has put into reaching an agreement on this important directive on supplementary supervision of insurance undertakings .
Once more Ireland has been seen to be dragging its feet .
Aristotle was more successful in the West than Averroës was in the Islamic world .
Here too the Commission bears particular responsibility in the search for a means of finally ending this blockage .
Commissioner van den Broek was right in identifying them as such .
Like any other European country , Turkey indeed has a right to become a member of the European Union , but it also has corresponding obligations .
Clearly , a political solution is the only viable way .
I hope that decisions can be taken here promptly this time .
Secondly , I have heard it said , even by distinguished colleagues , that we cannot discuss the refugee question because we have already discussed the Albanians ; rather , we should send them back to the villages razed to the ground by Milosevic .
Milosevic of course !
Mr President , I regard this debate as extremely important .
I think that transport through the Straits is of concern to all the European Union &apos;s countries , especially those in the south , and in that sense I think she should comment on the fact that , despite the Treaty of Montreux , Turkey is trying to control it .
Their passports and identity papers are taken from them and , deprived of any rights , they are forced to earn the money the pimps paid for them .
The EU will therefore continue to give strong support to the US mediation efforts in every way and to coordinate its own approach closely with that of the United States .
We find this unacceptable and unsafe .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have closely examined Mr Secchi &apos;s report , together with the opinions and the Council directive on a common system of taxation applicable to interest and royalty payments made between associated companies of different Member States .
I do not know who wrote that or whether that person had actually been sampling some of the products of excise duty prior to writing it .
Having analysed the current situation with the reduced rates , the Commission has confirmed that there are indeed considerable disparities .
We were told that electronic trading will lead to distortion but electronic trading represents such a marginal amount , not even 1 % .
Public institutions , e.g. local and national governments , and the European institutions themselves are amongst the worst late and slow payers .
Faced with these new challenges , SMEs must be able to mobilise the necessary human and financial resources rapidly .
I would be interested to know what creative ideas the Commission can come up with here .
With regard to the amendments , I would like to focus on two points : firstly , we are strongly in favour of the amendment that introduces a new article on the use of debt @-@ collection agencies or services in the single market . Secondly , we feel it is important to mention the various amendments that take into account the problem of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises .
These are all appropriate measures which will not distort competition but will , on the contrary , allow better use to be made of the opportunities offered by the market .
( The Minutes were approved )
In the words of the Jean Ferrat song , women are men &apos;s future .
These benchmarks should be based on the average of the three most successful Member States .
We will certainly listen with considerable interest .
In a recent report on the competitiveness of the textile industry I took the opportunity to propose this approach , which was accepted .
In Sweden the figure is 11 % , which is only natural since Swedish women are already in a better position .
As Mrs Colombo Svevo said , her report cannot be discussed in isolation from the excellent one by Mrs Marinucci and the debate relating to it .
We are also voting against Amendments Nos 6 and 11 , which concern the timescale .
And the only promising programme , that of introducing environmental tax reforms as quickly as possible , continues to be debated again and again in the relevant committees .
The European Union has made considerable efforts here .
But , as today , this has never stopped us from talking about it .
Of course , it is sometimes depressing when we try again and again to make progress , to provide support and assistance , and yet things do not turn out as well as we would have wished .
Belgium and other European states owe a large part of their current wealth to the exploitation of former colonies in the Great Lakes region .
The joint debate is closed .
Mr President , our group tabled an urgent motion for a resolution on Cambodia to put forward three main points .
In this particular case , it seems that Massachusetts intended to apply sanctions to companies which entertained any form of economic relations with Burma , be they American or foreign , in particular European .
We are aware that some of these fires are of criminal origin while others are the result of climatic changes leading to lengthy droughts and heatwaves .
Madam President , I would ask for the attention of the House for a moment .
In brief , I fully agree with the comments made by the rapporteur , Mr Hendrick .
Only the parts were rejected , and not the whole text .
They experience psychological , economic and social difficulties , which call for a well @-@ focused mix of policies as different as the situations concerned .
I am happy to report that our plans took a very important step forward just yesterday .
All the interested parties must participate in the discussion , dissemination and implementation of monitoring measures .
The debate is closed .
I just wanted to make this clear .
We shall now proceed to the vote .
The interim agreement therefore marks an important stage in the development of our cooperation with the transcaucasian republics , and we also see it as an incentive for a speedy resolution of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh conflict .
Mrs van Bladel has the floor on a point of order .
His mantra @-@ like insistence on the word &apos; detail &apos; , his persistent use of it à propos of the Holocaust , reflect an obvious desire to provoke , even though that desire is glossed over with half @-@ hearted expressions of token regret .
( Heckling from the French non @-@ attached Members : &apos; Vous mentez ! c &apos;est faux ! &apos; ) said that the Americans built the gas chambers in the Buchenwald concentration camp after the War .
Mr President , this report , by my good friend Mrs d &apos;Ancona , has both positive and negative aspects .
I agree with Mr Blokland that , in terms of principle , it was a mistake to refer this report back to committee .
I too want to mitigate suffering , and references to Trojan Horses are misplaced in my view .
Between now and then , I will be working alongside others in the Commission on evaluating the range of measures taken over recent years in this area .
One point is the general disorder that prevailed during the tests , with a lack of supervision of toilet visits and use of mobile phones .
We need better information .
A good system of inspection must also be simple , easily implemented and not cumbersome , and it must discourage fraudsters .
I would not like this discussion to become a personal confrontation between Mr Coates and yourself .
However , he did suggest that there were still some important aspects that needed to be clarified sufficiently before the euro came into effect .
The IMF , with our money , has baled out supranational banks , instead of individual countries .
This naturally provided greater scope for the hedge funds , which operate not only in the money market but also in the commodity market and which , because they can be quickly liquidated , lead to a doubling of costs for entire industries .
So I believe that this balance safeguards the interests of both operators and the manufacturers of terminal equipment .
The second green rate is for direct income support for farmers such as premium payments .
In response to the wish expressed by the rapporteur , we can certainly also submit a report on the entire process that is taking place to prepare the Community for the euro , and we shall probably manage that by the end of November , which I hope will ensure that Parliament is not only informed about the present situation but is aware of the action that remains to be taken .
If the aliens ever do take over they may have the same view of history as it does .
However , would a ban on the extreme right not be an extraordinary acknowledgement of political weakness , in view of the ambiguous fascinations which it exerts over part of public opinion ?
But this will be dealt with at a later stage .
It proposes greater coordination and cooperation between Member States in dealing with the serious problem of the escalating use of illegal drugs , whilst recognizing that - with the current divergences of view in the policies adopted by different countries - full harmonization is not practicable at the present time .
In conclusion , I am glad that my Group has been able to support this report .
In order to cancel out these effects , agricultural prices must be converted through the EAGGF .
We neither wish nor require to start again from scratch .
I hope that the confidence between our institutions can be restored , that tempers can be calmed and that the necessary clarifications can occur without the pressure of leaks and a general climate of suspicion .
However , the fight against fraud cannot be discussed without noting that total freedom in the circulation of goods and capital - that is , the absence of any controls - favours fraud and trafficking on a large scale .
As is clear from the title and substance of the report , it is based on special report No 8 / 98 of the Court of Auditors and hence on Article 206 of the Treaty .
Only an independent OLAF , cooperating with the Court of Auditors and , of course , with the Commission and answerable to the European Parliament , will develop into an incisive instrument in the fight against fraud and cooperation .
In my five minutes I cannot really say a lot but I know there were four points that Mr Tomlinson wanted to be highlighted and these are as follows .
This House has complete faith in Mr Miranda and we therefore support his conclusions .
It looks as if they might even be the first body to get the certificate of assurance within the European Community .
Mr President , we know that we spend a great deal of money on the safety of nuclear power stations ; that is done under Euratom .
Exactly what happened is currently being looked into by the Belgian authorities .
I did not doubt his sensitivity in recognising these cultural events , which have old traditions - the Misteri d &apos;Elx dates back to the end of the 14th century - and which have continued up until today . This is , in some way , proof of the multi @-@ culturalism inherent to Europe .
By the way , I have just come from Washington where I participated in a G8 meeting on development , and it was thanks precisely to my intervention that it was possible to ensure that the next G7 / G8 meeting on development will include trade and development and the concerns of developing countries as one of the main topics of the agenda .
From the analysis carried out by the Commission &apos;s services , it emerged that the production of 2 100 000 tonnes in 2001 from underground seams proposed by Spain for the HUNOSA company corresponded almost exactly to production in 1997 from the underground seams .
Thank you , Mr Papoutsis .
Implementation must take place in ways which the European Union itself sometimes does not allow to proceed .
It is vital that information be made available so that we can assess progress to date and determine what still has to be done at any given moment .
Now the Commissioner will perhaps say shortly that that is how it is done .
Looking at these advantages , the VMS system should bring about a 30 % reduction in accidents and a 40 % cut in the numbers of dead and injured , an average reduction in speed of 10 % , a 30 % reduction in rain @-@ related accidents and an 85 % reduction in fog @-@ related accidents .
The Commission &apos;s report arrived at a key moment for the future of the Community tourism policy , between the problems of fraud concerning certain actions in the early 1990s and the major challenge that the start of the new millennium represents for us .
The report calls on the budgetary authority to make a functioning budget available for direct Community measures for 1999 .
Mr Watts , I have taken note of that so that it can be corrected .
I wonder how these issues should be dealt with in the future .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there has obviously been a communication problem between Parliament , the Council and the Commission , since the Commissioner only realised what was happening at the last minute thanks to the prompt on the screen .
The main tasks of the new special envoy will be to coordinate the EU &apos;s humanitarian activities with those of the international humanitarian organisations and , at the same time , to act as a point of contact for the Belgrade government and as an intermediary between it and Kosovo &apos;s political leaders .
Mr President , there are a number of questions I should like to ask .
The mission by the American envoy Richard Holbrooke has so far been a failure .
Europeans should finally be left to deal with the conflicts within Europe and to build up their own security system themselves .
When we want to declare something inadmissible , we move a motion of inadmissibility .
Several of the amendments put down suggest some interesting options in this respect .
Thus greater independence for UCLAF may be one of the few steps that can be taken at the present time to make the unit more effective in its action against fraud involving the EU &apos;s financial interests .
The present tourism operational programme accounts for 369 million pounds , which is over 8 % of the overall Structural Fund programme presently spent in Ireland .
Apart from the greater financial autonomy which would ensue , the main advantages of introducing new own resources in the system would be to enhance political accountability and visibility in the eyes of the public .
The discussion on net contributors , led by the former Minister of Finance , Mr Waigel , can thus confidently be consigned to history , along with the Finance Minister .
Why not talk about finance ?
But often , instead of finding freedom , they end up dying a horrible death , becoming victims of the trade in human beings or finding that they are not welcome in their &apos; promised land &apos; .
Mr President , the problem of illegal immigration deserves specific attention because of the intense human suffering involved .
Whereas it is fair to expect us - Italy , Spain , and Greece when it joins the Schengen area - to carry out careful surveillance of our coastlines , it is also fair to equip us to fulfil our tasks properly , not only of monitoring but also of cooperation and humanity .
However , this satisfaction is tempered by the fact that the electoral system is less than fully democratic with too much power vested in the hands of the elitist functional constituencies .
Last week one of Hong Kong &apos;s most powerful men , Sir Donald Chang , visited my country , and while in The Hague gave a further illustration of how Hong Kong , as a special administrative region in China , is determined to maintain transparency and the strict application of the laws of the market .
Hong Kong of course supports it , and provides a unique example to China of the benefits of WTO membership .
In the past few years , all we have had is an occasional visit from a representative of the Council , sometimes when the Ombudsman was present to give a report to the committee - which is welcome - but very rarely when there was a matter of particular concern to one of the Member States .
I should like to ask the President of the Council , in the event of the agreement of 18 May coming into force - which appears unlikely at present - if the Minister can assure the House that this will not lead to the creation of serious obstacles for European traders seeking to carry on business activities in Cuba , those being implicit in Mrs Albright &apos;s letter ?
In the insurance field , I would refer the Honourable Member to Directive 92 / 49 / EEC , which aims to regulate activity in this sector and ensure greater competition .
Fiscal policy is primarily a national matter , however . We all know how sensitive people are to being told by the EU what tax policies they should adopt .
The onus is on the European Union to tackle the pollution which is causing health problems and which could be avoided .
At our first reading , the European Parliament considered this action programme to be of undoubted benefit , and greatly improved it through 28 amendments , which among other things provided for the people most directly affected - the sufferers themselves - and their families to be involved in the programme .
I should especially like to thank my assistant , for whom this report was the culmination of four years of specialised work in this area .
We should now devise rules to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry .
This success has undoubtedly been achieved thanks to the combination of the rapporteur &apos;s rigour and skillful negotiating .
After all , we all know about the complaints of numerous sectors that could offer enough jobs in certain regions , but cannot find suitable workers .
But justice still has to be administered if the Court is to be strengthened .
( The Minutes were approved )
Investigators in such cases must have all possible resources to intervene , and we must not have a situation , such as that publicised here recently , where not all the documents are to hand .
We now have to ask ourselves if this is a desirable state of affairs to be in .
It covers only safeguards and the transport of radioactive materials , and while safeguards are certainly very important , they have nothing to do with this issue .
I hope the Commissioner will do some work on this .
It would therefore be a great shame to lose this scientific aquis , particularly concerning issues relating to the clean and efficient use of coal , because Europe &apos;s technological level , which I believe to be so important , is on a par with , and in certain areas even above , the situation of the international market .
I would also like to reaffirm my support for our colleague &apos;s relevant proposals .
I believe that they correspond to the expectations of the majority of those who may be affected by the fifth joint programme on research and development .
We would like instead to get away from an energy supply system based on the burning of fossil fuels in the longer term .
Semira is not the first victim of a restrictive refugee policy practised by Member States of the Union and also by the Union itself .
This is clear , for example , from the shocking testimony of the Reverend Herman Boon , the chaplain at Zaventem Airport .
Madam President , although this has already been said , there is reason to note that the Slovak people have realised that in a democracy it is possible to change the future of one &apos;s country .
The Internal Security Act , which permits detention for long periods without any form of trial , violates the most fundamental principles of human rights , as does the criminal discrimination against homosexuals and the threats , persecutions , arrest of critics , mistreatment of detainees , refusal to grant legal assistance and much more .
A strong message has to be sent out and it has to be forced to toe the line on this issue .
The new condemnation of Mrs Zana by the Ankara State Security Court on 17 September is particularly worrying as it has inevitable consequences for the situation of freedom of expression in Turkey .
Secondly , we must look at the situation of the factories which are to close and the development of the whole group .
But the Alleanza Nazionale delegation calls on Parliament not only to condemn the defaulting countries , but also to enquire into the real reasons for the crisis facing that institution .
That is the sort of approach we want , not a great harangue about obscure points which do not help anybody in this debate .
Nor are those who have to provide the information for these statistics particularly enthused by having to fill out so many questionnaires , particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , which consider statistical questions to be a tiresome duty .
However , in a global economy in which multinational corporations are assuming an increasing prominence , we cannot confine ourselves to the European area .
I therefore think that there is a misunderstanding here .
But clearly that growth has not been the same in all countries , so the solutions cannot be the same for a country where over @-@ production stands at 104 % and for others where the level of supply exceeds 470 % .
What proposals for financial help were requested ?
That is quite clear , and then we shall never be able to resolve this dilemma .
During the market depression that we are experiencing , they are obliged to produce , even at a loss , and to sell at very low prices .
Nevertheless there are ways in which politics move sometimes that are quite mysterious .
The consumer wants to know what he is eating , and farmers like to know what production standards they have to meet .
The market in agricultural products is therefore no longer linked exclusively to price , but to the region .
Producers realise as never before that respect for consumers &apos; interests and meeting their needs is an absolute prerequisite for success in the marketing of food .
The Objective 2 measures remain extremely important to creating and preserving jobs .
He also fears that the population ceiling established by the Commission will lead to inappropriate criteria for defining theoretically eligible regions .
Mr President , I appreciate and thank you for your kind words .
Mr President , I should like to inform the Labour Party , having made that comment , that Mr Moorhouse has obviously found the real third way , which is liberal democracy .
We must do that another time .
The reduced capacity to transport oxygen manifests itself particularly in young babies up to six months old and causes a condition which is commonly known as &apos; blue baby syndrome &apos; .
Nitrate levels in the environment are far too high , and it will take tens of millions of guilders to clean up our drinking water . More certain still is that by the year 2002 the Netherlands may face a fine of 500 000 guilders a day .
However , the problem in Portugal is not the same as that facing Sweden or the Netherlands .
The widespread use of synthetic chemicals is a post @-@ war phenomenon .
In the United States alligators have been affected .
It is a high @-@ quality document , containing good suggestions as to the policies we should implement .
Looking at the situation as it is at present , the incorporation of environmental safeguards into other policy areas is still nowhere near good enough .
I should like this to be corrected as I was here yesterday .
It is somewhat strange that the Council forgets budgetary rigour when increasing a programme that has serious difficulties in terms of absorption capacity , with implementation figures well below the amount allocated .
Will the next financial perspectives be sufficient to ensure that spending develops ?
Last year , one of the main political questions was whether anything should be done about the supposedly excessive compensation paid to British arable farmers , for example .
But to hold these poorest people in the world hostage whilst we sort out the administrative problems of the Commission is not fair .
That is what Europe needs , and that is also what Europeans need .
The reality is that the majority of our group will be voting against the amendment which will put the money on the line .
I believe that our control role must be exercised with the greatest possible rigour if we want healthier , more transparent institutions which are more capable of responding to people &apos;s expectations .
I very much hope that the recent recognition - much deserved and much valued - that Mr Hume has had bestowed on him by the Nobel group will act as a further incentive to Mr Trimble and all the others that are there to follow right through to the end of the road , knowing that they have the full support , not only of Parliament , but of the entire world .
It is always difficult tackling a subject where national passions often rule over reason - and agriculture is always a real minefield .
We do not need more delays , we need legislation which takes account of consumers and the precautionary principle .
You can control people with policy , but not markets or capital .
The other point I would like to make relates to the famous 100 % reserve of part D operational appropriations . In my opinion , one of the European Union &apos;s most positive external actions , our emergency humanitarian aid , has been taken hostage to resolve some irregularities that are out of all proportion to the sanction .
We did not have the hype we have had for the past two years .
That is why we are well advised to tell the Commission that there are two conditions and that these need to be met .
Amendments have been tabled to that effect .
I am delighted that the Commission has proposed that Article 4 should be used to accommodate Parliament &apos;s concerns and that this money should not be lost in the budget , or be subject to any complicated and costly procedures and that in this way we can maintain , specifically , targeting in relation to ECSC funds .
It is unfortunate that the non @-@ governmental organisations , the people who work for us and with this aid should be the ones that suffer .
If it cannot be given now , I would be glad of an assurance that it will be provided in writing .
There is no doubt that , if the European Union &apos;s institutions are to be made more effective , one approach would be to broaden the scope of their powers and even to increase their respective weightings .
Perhaps , instead of recalling what a political action means , it would be preferable to offer an overall view allowing us to go more deeply into the various issues and see what impetus the European Union can be given with a view to the future .
We will clearly need to consider , against the objectives set in the unanimously agreed mandate of 1995 , what the best way forward now would be on further work on trade and investment , including the MAI .
Mr President , the Prime Minister , Mr Jospin , chose the only correct option last week in announcing that France was to withdraw from the OECD negotiations on the MAI .
The French decision puts down an important marker in this respect .
I believe that we will never know the answer to that question because the negotiations are likely not to be concluded in that way .
I would like to propose , however , that we should be a little more ambitious in one respect , namely the matter of particulate emissions .
We think that the common position is in large part acceptable .
Mr President , my name is Schiedermeier !
The successes of the past show that we have good reason to be optimistic for the future .
They should not present the Member States and the Union as being always in conflict , they should stop using the Union and its institutions , and in the first instance the Commission , as a convenient scapegoat , and they should stop inventing &apos; euromyths &apos; .
The new Treaty recognises how important this issue is .
At the Pörtschach summit we must ask - and I expect you to do this - what the new Bonn government &apos;s views are on the independence of the European Central Bank .
The drama of foreign policy which is once again being revealed over Kosovo is that there is not in fact any common foreign policy at all .
I should also like to thank you for paying homage to the historic work of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
The people are aware that the list of the Union &apos;s shortcomings is a long one .
But in what the Union can and should take on , it must show greater commitment and efficiency .
Firstly , there are still no European political parties worthy of the name .
It is to be welcomed that the Council &apos;s common position meets the main demands from the first reading in Parliament .
I wish to join in this protest and make it known to the public , on behalf of the German @-@ speaking Members .
In the meantime , the Commission continues to prepare proposals for the Council , as requested , to sharpen up the sanctions policy and package which has been in place for quite some time but which contained some loopholes that needed to be closed .
So the tragedy continues : more people are being forced to leave their homes and take refuge in the forests .
That is all the more reason for us to get down to work .
It seems to me highly irresponsible to just allow people to engage in such dangerous work for which they have received no military training whatsoever , in addition to being unarmed and also , as we have heard , with an appeal to the Serbs to help evacuate them in an emergency .
My group is concerned for the citizens , for social stability and democracy .
The Marxist dictator Allende had ruined the country , which , following the lorry @-@ drivers strikes , was experiencing a revolt among housewives .
Despite all the problems engendered by the changes in Eastern Europe , which have brought similar problems in their wake , we should not forget these partners , and especially not the risks which this kind of disappointment can entail .
Under the Treaty of Amsterdam , the preferential treatment that public service broadcasters are getting is bound by special conditions governing the content and quality of programmes .
Mr President , perhaps I might cite two topical examples of convergence .
US companies are much more successful than their European counterparts .
The entry into operation of Economic and Monetary Union , and consequently too the European Central Bank &apos;s assumption of responsibility for monetary policy , coincide with a period of exchange @-@ rate fluctuations and pressures which , I would like to hope , are temporary but , as it seems , are not an isolated phenomenon but one that is fairly generalised and needs careful and prudent handling .
The central banks themselves also have cause to keep an efficient quantity of foreign reserves , since in future part of the income from foreign reserves will be added to the reserves of the national banks .
Bearing in mind that the vote in the Committee on Social Affairs on these amendments was unanimous , we hope that the Commission will accept them and amend its initial proposal .
A strict interpretation of the term by Member States , in so far as one is technically possible , could not only signify an end to furniture production , but could also pose a threat to the production of hand @-@ crafted work .
I wish to congratulate her on her report .
Perhaps Mr Monti will tell us what he thinks of that idea .
In any event , we shall look into it .
Can we carry the previous vote over to the motion for a resolution ?
Although I reject many of the budget items , particularly the support for nuclear energy and for fusion research , the contributions to the NATO golden jubilee and some agricultural premiums , I voted for the budget because the prudent measures it finances outweigh the others .
Obliging Parliament to shuttle between Brussels and Strasbourg is a terrible waste of financial resources .
Most of what is said takes us too far along the road towards integration and federalism .
In the light of these figures , what conclusions can be drawn ?
The judicial authorities in the United Kingdom and Spain have to go through the correct processes .
I hope that justice will give them the victory that history , hampered by crime , denied them .
It is an immensely important opportunity for European businesses and engineering skills .
But we do need a decommissioning fund to ensure that the population is protected from radiation .
And not just those of Soviet design .
Community co @-@ financing in the Objective 1 area is 75 % , and 50 % elsewhere .
As Mr Otila said , forestry in the future must operate according to the principle of the free market .
As for industrial @-@ type operations , which often cause pollution , let us steer them towards the &apos; polluter pays &apos; type systems , with environmental conditions and an upper limit for aid .
We want the economic benefits of tourism , but we need investment in bread @-@ winner jobs as well .
I remember the time when nearly all farming was organic .
The other consideration is that , if farmers go beyond this minimum standard and do more to improve the environment , society must compensate them for the loss of earnings or additional expenses this entails .
The European Parliament is far more agreeable in that respect than is sometimes the case , unfortunately , in other parliaments .
At the moment in Northern Ireland there is no structural support .
I have , on a number of occasions on a Friday , raised the fact that this sitting , which is often a very good sitting , is not televised .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the information society knowledge is a vital resource and information the most important raw material .
I was very impressed with the library provision and the importance of libraries in Finland and I commend Mrs Ryynänen &apos;s report .
So I will do likewise this time , and congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Ryynänen , on the work she has done in the name of education and culture .
However , even if sign language were to be recognised and enough interpreters were available everywhere , there would still be a great many problems .
It is too ridiculous for words that we do this in a way which makes it impossible to guarantee that our plans can actually be implemented in the budget year for which they were intended .
Despite the fact that I had passes for them to go into the visitors &apos; gallery , they have been prevented from doing so .
Compiling these reports has been a huge task .
That is why the preparation in general has to continue .
Estonia is already part of the first wave but has it made sufficient progress in the treatment of its Russian @-@ speaking minority and is Latvia not now overtaking Estonia in this respect ?
I am being careful because I regularly tend to mix up the nuclear power plants in Bulgaria , Lithuania and Slovakia .
The motion for a resolution contains a large number of calls on the European Council and the Commission .
As an example , let me quote the Kyoto follow @-@ up process .
Manufacturers claim that an indication of this kind discriminates against their products in favour of other medicines , and is pointless given that therapeutic indication is not part of the registration procedure .
And it is easy to see why .
I also agree that there is no reason to maintain the ban on registering veterinary homeopathic medicinal products for foodproducing animals .
So I am in favour of that section of the amendments .
On the other hand , I do not agree with the proposals and amendments from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , because they overstep the mark .
I am just trying to imagine what would happen if we included game .
The debate is closed .
We should take account of the very good advice from the European Federation for the Arts and Heritage which has just produced a conference report .
On the measures for implementation - Amendments Nos 24 , 25 , 26 , and 27 - such measures are generally published by the Commission in the Official Journal , where information on decisions taken by our institutions is provided for the benefit of practising professionals .
We say that we should not create imbalances between the four freedoms , we should also enforce freedom of movement for workers and thus improve the entire concept of the single market .
But , Mr Kerr !
We are limited in the space we can give to an opinion .
Sadly , concepts such as European citizenship for young people , living together and inter @-@ cultural learning have been pushed into the background .
It is most important that young people should have the chance of international exchanges under these programmes too .
To my mind , this point is essential if we are genuinely to improve our youth programmes .
As long as we continue to regard olive plantations as more important than young people , we are barking up the wrong tree .
I would like to thank Mrs Waddington for drawing my attention to this essential aspect , which is also a key factor in ensuring the success of the European pathway .
We have voted against Mr Castagnetti &apos;s report today on the promotion of European pathways in work @-@ linked training , including apprenticeship .
With the welcome move towards greater EU integration and particularly in the context of enlargement , Europe &apos;s rich cultural diversity is its greatest resource in protecting the identity and individuality of each Member State .
This is the fundamental issue underlying the Socrates II programme , and I subscribe to it totally .
It has not been properly thought through , and although it has been toned down and is thus an improvement on the original , it is still unacceptable .
The absence of statistics in such an important area seems to be a contradiction given that the Structural Funds account for a third of Community expenditure and that , as I have already mentioned , we all agree on the importance of the role of SMEs in a modern economy and in job creation .
The next item is the order of business .
The Commission &apos;s relationship with the Member States &apos; judicial authorities is simply different from the situation that would apply within a Member State .
So a whole network of firms largely managed to bring the implementation of a whole policy under their control , and they were able to do so because this was tolerated , if not encouraged , by Commission officials .
Let me draw your attention to three of them , which are obviously reasonable . In future , we want a better method to be found for issuing credit cards , because sending them by post , as is usually done now , is too unsafe .
But the future role of UCLAF still has to be clearly defined and , in the wake of cases of fraud at ECHO , the President of the Commission , Jacques Santer , has just publicly announced the Commission &apos;s intention to transform the UCLAF into OLAF , a body completely independent of the Commission , extending its inquiries and investigations to all Community institutions . That would then leave it for the Commission to focus on the legislative proposals and coordination with the Member States in the fight against fraud , in the interest of the European Union , as would be the case of counterfeiting the euro .
What we need , without any doubt , is a combination of repressive and preventive measures .
The sole guiding principle in making decisions will be how effectively we can protect the euro .
The Commission can accept the remaining nine amendments .
There are three main problems which may be a cause of division .
I would like to believe that the Commission will accept all these amendments .
Had the same criteria that apply to other cereals been applied to durum wheat , more than ECU 3 billion in subsidies could have been saved over a four @-@ year period .
On behalf of the Court , I would like to thank , in particular , the Committee on Budgetary Control under its active , wise and intelligent chairman Mrs Diemut Theato , together with the rapporteur responsible for us , Mr Brinkhorst . Finally , I would like to thank all of you who have listened to me here at this early hour of the morning .
According to the Court &apos;s audit , ECU 70 billion have not yet been spent .
Firstly , many newspaper reports simply rehash the special reports already published officially by us .
We have about 10 000 contracts a year and about 3 000 public tenders .
I hope I can reach a more satisfactory resolution of this with the PPE Group , because I think it is putting our future cooperation in jeopardy .
Europe &apos;s leaders have concluded too late , regrettably , that a better balance is needed between a Europe of monetary union and a policy of employment .
Mr President , allow me to begin by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr van Velzen , who has managed to home in on the fundamental issues concerning this key aspect of the economy - employment .
You all know that early intervention to prevent youth and long @-@ term unemployment and the move from a curative to a preventative approach lie at the very heart of the strategy .
Both of these relate to the reinsertion of text that was part of my document prior to the vote in committee .
The industry is familiar with them . They are afraid that a European directive will create a lack of clarity and thus an additional link in the chain of decision- making on clinical testing .
The Commission mentions it only randomly , however , instead of devoting a chapter to it .
I believe that it would be a good thing if the report were to emphasise that the issue of equality should be incorporated in all social policy , with particular emphasis on mainstreaming .
After two successful test runs involving the guidelines on parental leave and on part @-@ time working , we now have a Commission communication that is considered to be a revision and a new direction .
Mr President , I congratulate Mr Peter on his report , which is of a very high quality .
I will come to that at a later stage , but I entirely agree with her that we must not allow it to completely distort our consideration of relations between the European Union and the United States , which relate to wider issues .
Three conditions must be met : we must work to make trade more compatible with sustainable development and social welfare ; we must respect multilateral solidarity and commitments ; and we must guarantee real democratic control .
My second concern is that we must make it quite clear to our friends in the United States that we do not share the unilateral vision of managed trade they uphold and that is particularly evident not only in Act 301 and &apos; Super 301 &apos; , but also in extraterritorial legislation such as the Helms @-@ Burton Act and the D &apos;Amato Act . In addition , it underlies several other measures that contravene the regulations of the World Trade Organisation .
The project for a transatlantic marketplace , as it stands , will give a little more encouragement to the colonisation of Europe by the American economic powers . We must reject this .
I would like to think it could happen but , as you say , it has proved impossible so far and I do not see any great hope for the immediate future .
The Commission would be in favour of the national authorities including , in their regional development plan , proposals on ways of promoting integrated development when making plans for the next programming period .
I should like to thank her for attending .
Please allow me to declare an interest .
Concern has been expressed that consumers are being deprived of the opportunity , thanks to parallel imports , of buying branded products at cheaper prices .
If you look at the reports of the Court of Auditors , DG IA is hardly a model of sound management .
Commissioner , it would be good if you could do this .
I am not Mrs Schaffner who was down to speak , and nor am I Mrs van Bladel .
At present fewer than two per cent of all workers in Europe are employed in another Member State .
He , with our support , rightly questioned the wisdom of such extensive and detailed proposals . It was high time that this happened .
Manufacturers must now increasingly come together . Only in this way will the European Union score new successes in the aerospace industry and reap the benefit of its skills through the development of new activities .
Despite the difficulties caused by the problem of restructuring in the defence sector , the immediate progress to be made in the civil sector must not be delayed .
I consider it right and proper that the edge of the 50 cent coin should differ from that of the 10 cent coin , since it has proved difficult for people with visual impairments to distinguish between the two .
I also saw a film crew yesterday along the corridor filming some of our employees moving a trunk .
We want to decide Agenda 2000 during this parliamentary term , before the elections .
We cannot afford any duplication .
It is not the financial target of 1.27 % of GNP but the quality of the preparation for enlargement that must determine the level of aid .

I believe it is enough to analyse what we already have in that respect .
Everyone is aware of this situation so I will not go into it .
The Council &apos;s proposal amending the Regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation has two aims . The first is to alter the weight of the 50 cent coin in order to meet the requirements of vending machines , and the second is to change the definition of the edge of the 50 and 10 cent coins , at the request of the European Blind Union , to facilitate their use .
After all - to put it in business management terms - it produces valuable human capital .
It is also not focused on the search for specific solutions to their very acute problems , on the effort to safeguard and extend their individual and collective rights , on the development of initiatives aiming to address the profound crisis that is affecting the EU and on the promotion of a progressive alternative solution to the liberalisation and globalisation dictated by the multinationals .
Yet , the closer we get to political union , the further away it drifts from us .
He said that we do not want enlargement of the Union - we are in fact Europe , and we should try constantly to move closer towards the same principles in a common Europe .
Continued EU funding is necessary to help consolidate the progress made so far .
Turning now to the second controversial issue , everyone here knows that mainstreaming for women is not enough to reduce the discrimination against them in the labour market .
It offers a possibility of a better proposal than exists at present .
It would be ironic if , just when the work of the Commission has enabled us to halt , for the first time , the drain of our brightest and best young people away from the Highlands and Islands , it suddenly came to a stop because of the infrastructure .
Mrs Glase , concentration is not about cutting back on the given aims .
Therefore , the obligation for all the European institutions should be to try to improve and strengthen them , without forgetting the fact that there is also inevitably a flow of capital into the more industrialised Member States .
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Central America and European Union action .
However , we must not make the mistake of making decisions for them , as I believe that the chance to support the development of democracy in these countries has been presented to us on a plate .
The steps taken to relieve the burden of debt are also of vital importance .
We must also recognise that there has been a certain courage shown by Yassir Arafat in arresting some of the leaders of Hamas .
It could be seen as progress or one may feel rather uneasy , as I myself do , and think that the actors involved are only hoping to prolong a situation which has already been going on too long .
Secondly , the port . Foreign Minister Sharon said himself in talks with the President @-@ in @-@ Office , Mr Schüssel , that we could count on further steps towards agreement , if not agreement itself , in about two months &apos; time .
Let us accept a duty to negotiate this package on time .
But it is not so , since the cohesion policy funds will also be used to finance the pre @-@ accession , thus reducing by half a point the percentage of expenditure laid down at Edinburgh and confirmed in Agenda 2000 for the cohesion policy of the Fifteen .
For example , I read the Council &apos;s thoughts on the horizontal regulation where you specify that the main issues are the need to include &apos; environmental conditionality &apos; , the need to regulate aid , the need to fix a ceiling for direct aid and the need to determine how budgetary resources are redistributed .
Others , however , believe that radical changes to the system are indispensable .
I hope that I shall be able , with due brevity , to dispel most of your misgivings or at least make it clear where the Commission &apos;s view differs and why .
It is very important to keep to timetables , but it is just as important to take the right decisions , with the appropriate methods and pace of debate and with sufficient transparency .
The situation is particularly acute in sparsely populated areas .
In the end , there is a considerable possibility that the option that has the most support and the most justification will become a definitive part of Community legislation .
This is not a dispute between Italy and Turkey .
( Parliament decided to refer the matter back to committee )
Although the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs McCarthy and Mr Hatzidakis on the Structural Funds speaks of the &apos; horizontal nature &apos; of this Objective 3 , and considers that it should cover all areas of the Member States , there is reason to fear that lack of funds will cause the Objective to be confined , as suggested by the Commission , to only those areas that are not covered by Objectives 1 and 2 .
In this respect , 9 % of the population of the Member States of the Union benefited from Objectives 5a and 5b ; in the future , no more than around 5 % of the population will be eligible for such aid .
Most parties are in favour of a further integration of environmental policy objectives into the CAP .
In his draft report the rapporteur sought to extend the present measures , which are mainly aimed at developing agricultural structures , to other rural activities .
Once the Member States have resolved to apply the joint actions , it is only logical that they should then disregard visa restrictions and dispense with the principle of safe third countries .
We would therefore most strongly oppose the rapporteur &apos;s proposal for temporary status to be extended to a maximum of 10 years .
In fact , I cannot help thinking that this is similar to the discussion we had regarding the Members &apos; Statute .
It seems to me that one of the conditions for this must be not to set the prices too high as otherwise you will not help the people you want to help , who are mainly the people with the least money , while people with a lot of money will be able to buy the aid .
In an earlier resolution , Parliament has already clearly confirmed the judgment of the International Court of Justice which stated this , and that is why we should also remain consistent in our decisions here .
I believe that a particular form of indirect censorship is indeed carried out in Belgium , and we have been among those who have identified it in a number of matters that are corrupting the country .
Nor are they able to become really involved in a case through a completely independent prosecutor .
So take action and put aside half @-@ measures , put aside evasiveness , forget about investments , pipelines , oil and gas , and remember for once that you wish to be known as a democratic institution , a democratic organisation , the European Union .
In our explanation of vote , we should like to focus attention on the importance of patent applications and other patent @-@ processing procedures being carried out in all Member States &apos; languages .
It is because we are keen to see this idea progress that we have put forward this proposal . This is something that needs to be achieved .
In practical terms , this means that Romania , for example , has to arrange a visa for its negotiators to participate in top @-@ level meetings in Brussels , since Romania is still on a list which , despite having been annulled , is still in operation .
This measure is urgently needed , particularly because of the Union &apos;s inability to implement a genuine common foreign and security policy , even at its own borders !
A recent survey on the use of hashish among students in French schools shows that only 16 % of users are still at school at the age of 18 , compared with 75 % of the rest of students , and that 60 % of them do not progress beyond secondary education .
Mr President , I think that today we have seen how without the EU we should have not reached this binding agreement .
Certainly , a book is not a commodity like other household goods and appliances .
I have even done something which was perhaps not right in legal terms .
I believe these small bookshops depend very strongly on this issue of fixed book prices .
Once again , I would invite you to draft a resolution which seeks to strengthen the position of the small bookseller in a meaningful way .
pursuant to Rule 66 ( 7 ) , a recommendation in the form of a letter concerning the marketing of fertilisers containing cadmium in Austria , Finland and Sweden ( Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy ) ; -pursuant to Rule 99 , the report ( A4 @-@ 0434 / 98 ) by Mrs Schierhuber on inland waterway transport ( Committee on Transport and Tourism ) ; -pursuant to Rule 99 , the report ( A4 @-@ 0440 / 98 ) by Mr Langen on extending the temporary derogation applicable to Germany and Austria ( Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy ) ; -the report ( A4 @-@ 0400 / 98 ) by Mr Ferri on supplementary pensions , the vote on which was postponed during the November partsession ( Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens &apos; Rights ) ; -the motions for resolutions on various budget headings concerning human rights and democracy in Chapter B7 @-@ 70 , the debate on which took place on 17 November.If there are no comments , these changes are approved .
However , it is only really since the beginning of this year that we have developed a more comprehensive , more coherent and higher profile approach , involving all staff more directly .
Just how do you intend to ensure that the Commission really is transparent ?
You can file a motion of censure against me if you like , but I will say it .
Subject to that reservation , I hope we will manage to achieve three things .
However , we are going through a difficult phase .
That was confirmed in Pörtschach .
We have to improve the surveillance processes of national policies .
Its plans , as stated in the coalition agreement , sound very hopeful .
Lithuania has agreed to close Ignalina for good when the pressure tubes need replacing .
We , as Members of the European Parliament , also have to try to overcome the reluctance , sometimes even opposition , of the citizens of most Member States as regards enlargement .
I think it is most important , as far as the applicant countries are concerned , that this should be combined with a message of further encouragement , and then I think the speed and momentum of the process can be sustained and consolidated .
That said , what is undoubtedly missing from the Swoboda report is the whole issue of the Council &apos;s clumsy treatment of Turkey over enlargement , excluding Turkey for no reason from the list of countries that will one day become members of the European Union .
Mr Fabre @-@ Aubrespy has the floor for a point of order .
We should be judged here on the way we carry out our functions , to legislate , to monitor the work of the Commission and the Council and to set the budget of the Union .
On the question of principle , no Member of this House surely has so little respect for him or herself that they feel they should not be paid a proper salary at a level common to each and every one of us .
What seems to be of prime importance is how much a Member will earn and what for .
Likewise , however , we must disregard attacks motivated by anti @-@ European sentiments which aspire to discredit the European Parliament and the European Union &apos;s other institutional bodies .
I must say that I was shocked by this statement and I must ask you , in my capacity as a Member of the Bureau which is responsible for the administrative organisation of Parliament &apos;s work , to reassure our officials of the esteem in which their Members hold them .
The euro will provide Europe with true monetary existence .
Conveniently forgetting that is unhealthy , and stops us from reflecting on our own mistakes , something I have found sadly lacking in our debate on the crisis so far .
In fact , capital flows out but does not flow back in .
In practical terms , Mr Fabre @-@ Aubrespy , when we come to the vote on these amendments , we shall decide whether they are admissible case by case . I would ask you to draw my attention to them then .
I would say very clearly that I am not going back on what has happened .
The Statute must therefore be adopted by an absolute majority of the Members of Parliament .
I am sorry , Mr Fabre @-@ Aubrespy .
There is the fact that as MEPs we are voting , in the case of my country , to more than double our salaries .
Having a uniform salary means the need for a uniform tax .
However , the other Members - those living near the &apos; centre &apos; and on higher salaries , in addition to various official positions in their own countries - would occupy that space and end up taking decisions by themselves .
This method has been tried in Russia , for example , where average life expectancy at the beginning of the 1990s fell by six years .
There are not going to be three voices .
However , your written protest will be forwarded to the Rules Committee without delay , so that it can consider this interpretation .
My question to the President is about when the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control will have the opportunity to reflect upon the findings of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities .
This text will be forwarded immediately to the political groups , to the rapporteur , and to the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
In the text that we are going to vote on , the winners are transparency , information , small and medium @-@ sized enterprises , and the fragile sectors of society , such as the disabled and the elderly , and a fillip has been given to the outlook for peace , with the specific references to biological and chemical disarmament and the exclusion of nuclear armament .
It was not easy , but you have succeeded !
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the life sciences have hitherto been divided among three different programmes but they are now combined in a single , problem @-@ oriented programme .
Mr Linkohr said that the results would have to be quantified , and that Parliament would have to exercise an important supervisory role .
My Amendment No 20 highlights the fact that it is not the job of a research programme to pay for the decommissioning of nuclear facilities .
I very much welcome the fact that this specific programme continues the efforts to promote the training of European researchers .
You are responsible on behalf of the people in this respect .
In line with Parliament &apos;s wishes , it will propose a new distribution of the budget for this programme benefiting key actions , services to the citizens and essential technologies and infrastructures .
I know - or at least , I imagine - that we cannot now change the questions , but the Bureau should use its authority to monitor such matters .
The compromises shown on a daily basis in the selection of operators call into question the highest authorities of the Commission , and there are serious flaws in the appointment of officials which cast doubt on the credibility of the institution .
At worst , rejecting the accounts now may mean that good Commissioners like Mr Liikanen , who is the first Commissioner ever to have shown some interest in clearing things up , will be forced to resign .
Firstly , forcing the Commission to resign while Europe has weighty matters on its agenda would be very serious indeed . We cannot afford to deprive the EU of leadership at such a juncture .
Where this issue is concerned there can be no definitive refusal , no refusal that applies for the entire administrative future .
We have a huge task in front of us .
Parliament has successfully defended these appropriations .
The Council ignored it .
We would underline the importance of Union action to strengthen the rights of disabled people . The Helios II programme is a case in point .
I think you will agree that his years at the helm of the Committee on Budgets will not be forgotten .
I would like in any case , at this early stage , since I will indeed be going some more of the way with you - and have no fear , I still want to leave my mark on Agenda 2000 , so that you will think of the work I have had a hand in here for another seven years - to wish every success to those who must then continue working on the budget .
And we should be delighted about this .
There are , in fact , three .
Mr President , there has been talk of new employment goals for Europe . However , I fear that we could easily fall back into old moulds when it comes to ways of achieving them .
Before any new enlargement the European Union must , however , see to it that the policies of the separate northern dimension are realised and that next year the means are found to make progress on those issues designed to make policies in the European Union &apos;s Nordic regions more effective .
Should there be any difficulties , the Commission is kindly requested to use its powers in the field of aid and competition rules to improve market access .
That is why it is so important for the European Union to be present at an international level and for it to draw the political consequences of its economic dimension in order to assert itself before the rest of the world .
I should like to welcome Mr Monti and ask him to reply to Mr Watson &apos;s question .
Firstly , in November 1996 the Justice and Home Affairs Council decided to extend the mandate of Europol &apos;s drug unit , now Europol , to include trafficking in human beings .
Even if they have no legal entitlement to enter the Union , they can expect to have their human rights and fundamental freedoms respected .
Special offer fares of around GBP 16 are available to all citizens of the European Union for day trips .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , money is present in numerous acts of daily life .
I am certain that with a properly organised information campaign we will quickly adapt to the new euro symbol .
Other possibilities for resolving country- and region @-@ specific crises and the unemployment to which they lead could well be labour mobility and wage flexibility .
I feel that , in addition to freedom of movement for workers , freedom of movement for citizens would help to make our economies more fluid .
Firstly , there are shocks caused by nature , for example after an earthquake or epidemic .
I give the floor to the rapporteur , Mrs Lulling .
Last week the Council working party responsible discussed the amendments and I gather , Mr President , that it may be possible to avoid a conciliation procedure . That will save a great deal of time and money .
It is absolutely necessary that we do this .
The debate is closed .
But I shall check this information and will let you know immediately if it is correct .
But the Pörtschach meeting must not mask the progress made on the other major aspects of Community integration .
During this year of the UK and Austrian Presidencies , the European social market economy model has created more jobs than the Americans .
My group very much hopes that the initiative which the Council outlined in Vienna will allow us to establish a counterweight to the growth and stability pact which will secure future monetary security in the euro zone .
It is difficult , it is even extremely difficult , but we must use our imagination .
We are moving from the Europe of the internal market , which is more market @-@ oriented and service @-@ based , to the Europe of Economic and Monetary Union and a Europe that concentrates more on the issues in society that affect individuals , namely , environmental and social issues .
I ask myself how far that was due to the EU and how far it was due to the economic climate .
I remember my own Prime Minister , on the eve of a breakthrough in Northern Ireland , condemning the idea of sound @-@ bites and then saying that he felt the hand of history on his shoulder .
These authorities are also the best link to associations that have not been sufficiently spurred into action , in spite of their best efforts .
This report deals with the issues confronting a single currency . The first paragraph indirectly sheds light on the real problem with a heavily regulated common monetary policy .
But there are no concrete agreements .
On the other hand , it is not admissible to weigh up individual rights against the rights of the people , or to weigh up civil and political rights against economic , social and cultural rights , just as it is impossible to differentiate between substantive , economic and social democracy and so @-@ called &apos; formal democracy &apos; .
However , it is not enough to invoke the two human rights packages and the ILO conventions in the preambles to bi- and multilateral agreements , as in the most recent agreement with Mexico .
Accordingly , the European Union too is judged across the world by its everyday political actions , by the way it protects human rights on an everyday basis .
Mr President , I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs of these reports because they contain information and proposals that will be of great use to us . What is more , I believe that they contain practically everything we should say and do , and I say practically here and not absolutely everything as that would be going too far .
Human rights are now a priority objective in our external relations and our development cooperation .
The specific context of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights will refresh the memories of our fellow citizens and political leaders on the content of this Declaration , which our Member States are committed to respecting .
Mr President , my sincere thanks to Mrs Schaffner for her very thorough report .
Mr President , Mrs McIntosh , my positive words still stand .
The large number of questions on Western Sahara reveals the importance Members of the European Parliament attach to this subject , while at the same time showing that it is an enormously complex subject , involving a great number of historical , political and humanitarian aspects .
At the beginning of our presidency I thought perhaps the moment had come for that , but in view of these identification difficulties it was not feasible at that stage .
Mr President , Madam President @-@ in @-@ Office , many thanks for the expertise with which you have answered not just this question but all our questions over the past six months .
I would not like to thank or give recognition to those who , as in previous years , have used the pretext of human rights to formulate every conceivable political idea and ideological wish and introduce them as amendments .
It is true that the prisons are overcrowded .
This is also outlined in the 1997 report on respect for human rights in the European Union .
We are therefore asking for thought to be given to the consequences which the positions of the Commission , the Council and Parliament may bring .
There is also a small loophole , however .
However , a secondary aspect is that it also contributes significantly to simplifying the law .
One of the things we unfortunately cannot get to grips with in the European Union is the possibilities of taxation - and I think the Commission agrees with me when I say unfortunately , because that is a very effective way of modifying behaviour .
I have no problem with that .
I find the Rules of Procedure to be perfectly clear .
What we will be voting on , I hope as soon as possible , is whether we wish not to grant discharge at this stage , or whether as I have understood the Rules of Procedure , it has to go back to committee .
Mr President , that the fate of 400 000 people who are in prison is not important enough for us to delay lunch by six minutes speaks volumes about this Parliament .
It would in fact be logical to replace in French the restrictive notion of the &apos; rights of man &apos; with the more general notion of &apos; human rights &apos; .
Certainly , the clear , reaffirmed priority given to the fight against unemployment is very positive .
His report is the tenth of its kind since 1983 .
This positivist shift of the law in Europe is very serious : it marks a break with the most basic form of European humanism , which would urgently need to be rediscovered as far as adults are concerned and introduced to the younger generation .
My answer is the same as theirs : yes , regrettably it was .
He should be charged and tried , and if he is found guilty , he should be arrested and punished using strictly lawful methods .
We are continuing to monitor the situation in the region and sharing the information we have with the Council and the Member States , and we are prepared to take any other possible measures which might help to resolve the conflict .
The situation is worsening because of the lack of harmonised legislation in the single market of the Union .
Member States and applicant countries must be expected to ban the death penalty .
They also apply to the Sudan .
Whereas last time it was principally members of religious minorities and women who were threatened and imprisoned , and sometimes even murdered , this time it is intellectuals , opposition members and again women whom we must defend .
The European Union must therefore make every effort to ensure that no child under the age of 18 goes to war or is employed in the war machine . The European Union should also ensure that its Member States and other countries sign the International Criminal Court &apos;s protocol since , according to one of its articles , the use of children in war is a crime , as is the arming of children .
Does he have some travel plans or is he entertaining some distinguished visitors ?
Despite introducing Mr Elliott &apos;s resolution , I have to say that personally I have some doubts about paragraph 12 , which calls for small local groups to be supported by the Commission .
This represents a serious failure on the part of Parliament .
In the Commission &apos;s plan of action , which the PPE Group endorses , as Arie Oostlander &apos;s excellent report made clear , discrimination based on race , origin and creed is to be combated more effectively by means of practicable measures .
At a time when European society is opening up to new needs and requirements , we can fight and conquer racial discrimination , racism and the fear of what is different , as long as we teach our children that it is not enough to be European merely through our citizenship of this or that European country , but that one becomes European by learning to respect diversity , a value which does the greatest credit to this old continent of ours .
Mr McMahon is absolutely right in expressing his concern about the multiplicity of certificates that will be required .
The point I want to make is rather a simple one : as a Member of the European Parliament - which unlike other institutions constantly faces the public in a very direct way - I am often the recipient of strong criticism of EU legislation .
Madam President , I meant before the part @-@ session in January , so that we do not find ourselves in a dilemma then .
We are spreading our net a lot wider this time , hopefully not too thinly .
The debate is closed .
Therefore , before I give the floor to Mr von Habsburg , allow me to give the floor to Mr Kerr for two minutes .
We now have the largest integrated market in the world , with 370 million consumers , and they alone account for 1.1 % to 1.5 % of GDP growth within the European Union , and thus play a key part in economic convergence and in reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various Member States .
These considerations did not prevent the Commission from recently asking the Council to give it authorisation to implement a compulsory intervention mechanism in order to eliminate certain obstacles to trade .
The next item is the order of business .
It is not a matter entirely of competence either .
There is still , Mr Santer , a very large majority of more than two thirds in this House in favour of bringing this job of integration , this European Union , to completion under your inspiring guidance and on the basis of your proposal .
We are therefore hoping , Mr Santer , for total clarity , a lack of equivocation and , in particular , a wide @-@ ranging sense of responsibility .
Four years ago , I named employment as our principal priority .
This Commission was the first , on 22 November 1995 , to lay down rules of conduct in interpretation of Article 157 of the Treaty .
But the crisis is not always used to make a new beginning .
We would have hoped that , in addition to the basic measures presented by Mr Santer , concrete and objective answers could have been given to the concrete and objective problems facing us at the moment .
The ELDR resolution is quite clear on that .
They expected the opportunities to be predominant if the introduction of the euro prompted further , substantial moves towards communitarisation , culminating in full political union .
Applause
The Cologne meeting will be important in that respect .
I regret that because I believe that Europe is more than the sum of national interests and I felt a little nervous yesterday when on top of that your Chancellor emphasised that he would like to see a very open representation of German interests .
If we were to accept other forms of contributions that are less well controlled , for example , European taxes , we would be ignoring the possibility of future financial shifts .
My group , as also , I am convinced , the majority in the European Parliament , wants the timetable for adopting Agenda 2000 to be met .
Let me just say that at the outset .
If we want to do something for people all over Europe - and that includes people in the applicant countries - then we must take make sure they can live in an environment worth living in .
Finally , enlargement is a major issue .
I wish Mr Riester , the Minister for Employment , the same success that his predecessor Mr Blum achieved with the European works councils in 1994 .
Applause
Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , you have of course spoken for 30 minutes , but I think that the Members , who have heard you speak for two hours , have been listening very carefully .
We should take a leaf out of their book throughout the European Union .
I should like to go further on this point .
I naturally signed an authorisation pass and she was able to make contact with our librarians who did everything to help her with her research on Europe .
After all , we have discovered the need for that very clearly in the current debates .
I feel all this represents a definite improvement and , therefore , the quicker it is put in place , the better .
I believe it is a matter of extreme urgency for the various parties to find a solution as soon as possible , by means of a three @-@ way dialogue between the Council , Parliament , and , if it would be helpful , the Commission . A way out of the present impasse must be found .
The task of the Romanian administration is simplified by the fact that Romanian executive officials have already received intensive training under the PHARE programme .
We must just hope that this problem is resolved swiftly so that developments towards EU membership for the Baltic countries do not deteriorate .
I should like to make just one further point and then I will finish .
He is right to point out the importance of our relationship with the Republic of Korea and has given the House the key economic facts .
Do they have any say if , for example , Poland were to join with specific derogations which , as far as the EFTA countries were concerned , undermined the EEA agreement ?
To date , the Commission has been pleased with the arrangement .
As regards millennium initiatives we are informed of by operators in the Member States , I have instructed my services to make provision for awarding specific European sponsorship to projects conveying the spirit of the construction of Europe .
I support and encourage him to further consider the proposals about service levels and access for disabled people .
I would therefore ask you , Commissioner , to reply jointly to these questions by Mr White , Mrs Oddy and Mrs Kinnock in the two minutes which we have left before 7 p.m .
To this I wish to add that it has been shown by authoritative bodies such as the World Trade Organisation that there is no contradiction , no conflict between this and economic development which is at the same time a prerequisite for social prosperity .
In fact , it is only natural that an ILO convention that has been signed by the European Union or by its Member States forms part of the acquis communautaire , and I do not believe that there are any particular problems for the applicant countries or those who eventually want to join in terms of accepting the European Union &apos;s general system .
Firstly , we must emphasise the need to promote , by means of the fifth framework programme of research , the basic research and technological demonstrations required to develop high performance satellites that are adapted to the needs of navigation and positioning , and also the need to improve ground installations and in particular on @-@ board equipment on the different vessels , aircraft and land vehicles .
Mr President , European ports are a constant source of disagreement between the various Member States .
It is not just a question of altering the legal framework of public contracts or competitions in order to encourage these partnerships , as this is not enough .
Second , we have developed our international contacts , especially with the United States of America and Russia , and from those contacts it is clear that the United States of America will not accept joint ownership and control of the core global positioning system , primarily of course because of its continuing military role .
Provisions governing the liability of certification service providers are designed to ensure consumer and business confidence .
We do not feel that is satisfactory so we have retabled that .
Thirdly , there is information policy .
This has not amounted to much , and has left the field clear for the ECOFIN Council , whose theories on cofinancing and expenditure freezes have complicated and even seriously jeopardised the reform &apos;s future .
At the federal government &apos;s meeting with the Commission on Monday of this week in Bonn , Commissioner Fischler and I agreed that , if convincing alternatives are presented , the Commission is prepared to review its proposals and if necessary to table new ones .
If the European beef and veal industry is to be able to maintain beef production at anywhere near current levels , then , according to our analyses , a 30 % reduction in the intervention price is imperative .
As regards the appropriations saved by capping payments , it was proposed to hand this money over to the Member States .
But policy must continue to be set in Brussels , and there must be equal opportunities for competition throughout the European Union , with no distortion of policy by national rules .
Madam President , I should firstly like to congratulate the rapporteurs for their hard work and diligence in preparing the reports .
Not in my region in any case , where the situation is quite the opposite ; farmers have a hard time of it there , and it would be nothing short of insulting to reproach them constantly for being some of the rich ones .
Aberdeen Angus beef , cereals , oilseed , sheep , poultry , soft fruit and potatoes , to name but a few , are all produced in an industry which is economically crucial to Scotland , with an output of £ 2 billion and one in ten of all Scottish jobs being dependent on it , directly or indirectly .
The Commission proposals are geared towards the world market .
We in Parliament would be giving up an important instrument for bringing pressure to bear if we were now to give our approval .
With the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty , it is obvious that neither the Council nor Parliament will be capable of forming their executive body without first taking into account the position of the other .
It has also said that it is willing to support the principle of a more in @-@ depth dialogue on this issue , within the multilateral framework of the WTO .
However , it must be stressed that Member States &apos; ports differ in terms of ownership as well as in their organisational and administrative structure .
I am particularly concerned about the COM in beef and veal and about extensive production systems in general .
I believe that in cofinancing direct aid - aid that requires Member States to comply with certain measures - we could be heading towards severe discrimination .
One of the problems with modulation is that there is genuine concern that it will not be fair across the board .
The possibility of cofinancing will in essence lead to renationalisation of the CAP , even in part , and will affect mainly those countries which fall below the Community average in economic terms , such as Greece and other countries in the south , while in parallel it will have negative consequences for the development of Community agriculture .
I could also say that although milk is becoming cheaper , yogurt is becoming dearer ; you can be fairly sure of that .
But I do not know what he said on this issue so I cannot comment .
Of course snow falls in the beautiful Tyrol , in the almost as beautiful Allgäu and also in beautiful Lower Saxony , and then the cows just have to be brought into their stalls .
An acceptable basis has been found for sustainable basic conditions for improved ecological livestock production .
We will therefore not be able to reach a decision on the core issues regarding institutional reform during the German Presidency , and do not even wish to , because for the moment we have only been instructed to make a procedural proposal .
Does the Council share the view of my own Prime Minister , Tony Blair , that the loss of duty @-@ free could lead to the loss of thousands of ordinary people &apos;s jobs across the European Union ?

The Council pays particular attention to achieving the political objective of creating a Euro @-@ Mediterranean area of peace and stability .
So some of our competition money could well be used for development rather than aid .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I warmly commend the way in which the Commission has used this proposal for a directive to simplify significantly the procedures governing the right to deduct value added tax .
The legislation on which we are delivering our opinion today has great potential .
The Commission &apos;s proposal for a new directive designed to improve the climate for electronic trade on the Internet in Europe has come not a moment too soon for the European Union , or perhaps even a little late .
Drawing these up is primarily the job of policy @-@ makers , but it is essential that we involve users and manufacturers . All three sides will need to sit around the table .
On the other hand , we naturally have great respect for national values and cultures .
As for the second proposal , the fact of asking the complainant &apos;s opinion on our analysis before the Commission reaches its collective decision would inevitably cause further delay .
What you need to do is to listen to what Parliament is saying to you , listen to what the people in the European Union want and stop this folly of trying to liberalise the postal services purely on a dogmatic basis .
Occasionally one wonders if one &apos;s colleagues on the Liberal benches have the same degree of common sense ; be that as it may , I have certainly never abandoned my Liberal convictions .
This brings me to the draft Eurodac Convention , and I am pleased to report that the Council did indeed reach political agreement on this in December .
As you , Mr Nassauer , pointed out , we are today in the unusual situation of not only having to report on the events and progress of the last year , that is on the achievements of the British and Austrian Presidencies . We also have to give you a short overview of the German Presidency &apos;s plans for the next six months .
This area has gradually taken on greater significance , as Mr Nassauer also notes in his report .
You mentioned that we are under great time pressure .
I am grateful for the current Council presidency &apos;s suggestion that we need a new summit , as explained by Mr Fischer , the German Minister for Foreign Affairs , and I hope that the German Presidency will succeed in making certain changes in this area .
Now it is up to you , ladies and gentlemen , to decide , in good faith and in good conscience , whether you are going to grant us your confidence , the political confidence that we need to continue and to complete our political work in the interests of the citizens of Europe and to enable Europe to succeed .
We are voting to censure the college because the whole Commission is accountable and must accept responsibility for the fact that so much has gone wrong and will continue to go wrong .
The European institutional system has , for a long time , declared the Commission to be the guardian of an interest that is above that of the nations .
We were not supposed to vote for censure , because the motion at the root of this entire turmoil was tabled with an explicit aim : to grant the Commission our confidence . What have we done ?
The June Movement and the People &apos;s Movement have only voted to name individual Commissioners because the largest group in the European Parliament said that it would only vote for its own motion of censure if there was a majority in Parliament in favour of criticising a named Commissioner .
If this does not happen the college of Commissioners will cease to have my support .
The Member States in the Council must forcibly regain control of the Commission .
The most striking example of the European Union &apos;s laborious progress is probably the slow start that Europol has got off to .
Regarding the institutional deficit which various members touched upon , I do not dispute its existence , but I think we will have to cope with the situation as it stands .
Thank you , Commissioner .
Mr President , despite all the United Nations &apos; efforts , the situation in Angola is deteriorating again .
Fortunately , the European Union has recently sat up and started to take notice of East Timor and it was with satisfaction that we noted the conclusions on East Timor reached at the Vienna summit , for example .
I therefore believe that the Council should be aware that political pressure - along with cooperation - is essential to ensure visibility in this conflict and to help put an end to this situation .
We must pay fair prices and promote regional development , because peace is the reward for completing this process , not the prerequisite for launching it .
However , the rich countries are the ones that adopt illegally , that take drugs , that buy organs , and so on . We cannot just look from the North to the South with a critical eye , since we know that the developed countries are the ones that facilitate this type of trade because of their advanced economic and financial situation .
We are not used to that here .
The Commission knows about this and acknowledges that it is a problem , but up to now it has done nothing about it .
It is clear that the evaluation must take into account not only short @-@ term profitability , but also the consequences for employment , the social benefits for all consumers , and efficiency for the economy .
These and other misleading statements certainly made us have serious doubts at the start of the process .
This comprised two large buses going to the seaside once a year with 150 people aboard .
Issues that directly affect the family include the changes in the composition of the workforce , the new forms of labour organisation , the restructuring of social protection , and the changes in the distribution between men and women of tasks involving the care of dependents .
With regard to the European Monitoring Platform , if such a body were created at some point , the proposals relating to both its composition and its tasks should be seriously reconsidered .
However , it does not make a sufficiently constructive contribution , because in my view it is based on the wrong premise .
We must , on the one hand , rigorously ensure that the existing international rules , particularly within the context of the ILO , are effectively applied by all , and on the other hand , develop the rules of the WTO so that they take account of the essential issues of social and environmental dumping .
We have spent many years debating democracy , the rule of law , human rights and good governance in developing countries and in the ACP countries .
This problem will diminish if new jobs are created from the production of energy .
In all these regions there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done .
If State aid disappears before the year 2000 and current practices continue - namely Asian dumping - the majority of shipyards will be forced to close and all the work on modernising and adapting them , financed with European citizens &apos; money , will have been in vain .
I also believe , however , that we all know the success of Europe &apos;s economy will be judged not so much in monetary terms but in relation to the real economy , and there the situation is not at all encouraging .
If there are no objections , we will approve this amendment by Mr Kittelmann if it includes the textiles sector .
However , this issue cannot be considered in isolation or without extensively involving the industry .
If the Director @-@ General was referring to the public debate Members of this House are entitled to during question time , I must ask you to lodge a very strong protest on my behalf with the European Commission . I object to a senior official of the European Commission voicing the opinion that such issues should not be discussed in the public domain - the precise phrase used was &apos; in the marketplace &apos; - and that they should instead be discussed discreetly in the offices of the European Commission .
Finally , it must be emphasised that in future all direct agricultural aid payments will be subject to the observance of good agricultural practice , which de facto also means higher environmental requirements and for which absolutely no provision is made under our existing rules .
Mr President , Mr Robles Piquer , on the second part of your question , whether we are also prepared to encourage biomass farming and the production of alternative energy sources , i.e. renewable raw materials , let me reply as follows .
We do not even trade with each other , intra @-@ EU trade being only 4 % or 5 % of procurement .
The Member States made a big mistake in keeping the defence industry out of the single market , at Amsterdam as well .
A report of this kind should be seeking to formulate a strategy for turning a military capability into a civil one .
The committee held a public hearing to find out more about the &apos; non @-@ lethal &apos; weapons and HAARP , the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Project .
However , I want to say a word about the HAARP Project Mr Gahrton mentioned .
We have not seen any progress in the People &apos;s Republic of China .
As Members we are in an extremely difficult situation in regard to China .
We do not want to retaliate though by creating a self @-@ defeating cycle of protectionism .
Mr President , the Azzolini report on the communication from the Commission to Member States on regional policy and competition policy comes at a very pertinent time , only months before Member States are expected to deliver their list of state aid areas to DG IV and at a time when big decisions are to be taken by Member States on the future maps of structural funds for both Objective 1 and Objective 2 .
But subsidised tourism is a bad thing , it is unacceptable , because it does not produce sustained structural improvement but simply throws away and wastes huge amounts of European money .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Azzolini , on his excellent work .
But the Commission is not taking sufficient account of the special problems of the regions when it subordinates everything to the imperative of free competition and tries to cut back European aid while at the same time taking away any means of granting national aid to compensate for this in a flexible manner .
It allows for a broader based approach .
We must not , so to speak , export the problem .
I support the Commission &apos;s intention to prepare a directive - which I would like to see as soon as possible - in order to establish certain compulsory minimum levels of penetration of renewable energy .
At this particular time , when the issue of food safety is under widespread scrutiny , it is essential to have such a directive .
The next item is the recommendation for second reading ( A4 @-@ 0012 / 99 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , on the common position adopted by the Council ( 10460 / 98 - C4 @-@ 0583 / 98 @-@ 98 / 0014 ( SYN ) ) with a view to adopting a Council Regulation establishing a special framework of assistance for traditional ACP suppliers of bananas ( Rapporteur : Mr Liese ) .
So the Union must immediately undertake to give Somali banana producers direct access to the assistance provided under the regulation we are debating .
My feeling is that if we leave this we turn a blind eye to the interests of the small and the poor and I do not think that Europe would be fulfilling its duties .
Some countries have low costs , others have high costs , but this report does not give a clear and comparative view of the costs of using the European telecommunications networks in the various Member States .
Now that the United Kingdom too , under Labour , has radically altered its position on social clauses in public contracts , I look forward to seeing how the Commission will respond to our recommendations .
Finally , on the drafting of the interpretative instruments , while emphasising that this is an institutional responsibility entrusted to it by the Treaty , the Commission naturally appreciates the support of Parliament .
I should for example like to see the EU , together with the Member States , making a substantial investment to ensure that , over the next ten years , petrol is replaced by environmentally friendly fuels , creating a large pool of environmentally friendly jobs in the process .
The management team or , in smaller businesses , the manager , must be quick to recognise market openings for their products and services and must adjust their range rapidly to keep up with customer demand .
There appears to be recognition across the board that the existing battery cage system has got to go .
Finally we support the request to the Commission to make it compulsory , as soon as possible , to label eggs so that the consumer will know how the hens laying them are reared .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
Parliament adopted the resolution
We have serious reservations about the effect of increased production , as proposed by the Commission , on the environment .
It is also regrettable that there is no detailed description of the environmental implications of the various reform proposals , a shortcoming that should be corrected .
Who is taking more and more responsibility for elderly and disabled members of the family ?
Some basic rules to control arms exports could provide a solution .
I love this House and I love this Chamber .
It is intended that in order to counteract the greenhouse effect the level of emissions recorded in 1990 should not be exceeded .
On the other hand , it has to be said that the nightmare scenario of Austria giving up its stricter limit values is now not going to happen .
I am sorry to labour this point but it is one which has emerged in what is otherwise a rather technical regulation as a point that people can understand and about which many people are worried .
First , as regards the timetable for implementation ; at its maximum we will have to wait until the year 2020 before those Member States with more than an 80 % dependence on landfill , which are Greece , Ireland , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom , have to reduce the volume of waste going to landfill to 35 % of the total in 1995 .
Finally , it is important that , as newer technologies come on stream , this process must involve the consent and widespread participation of the general public and local communities .
We run the risk - that is , those of us who introduce such measures - of being buried along with those waste materials , because of the speed , or lack of it , with which we are moving to tackle the problem .
Both Mrs Malone and Mrs McKenna mentioned this in their speeches .
I commend the report to the House .
We have greater equality between people in Denmark than in Germany and the rest of the EU .
Moreover , if the tax is extended to cover other energy products , the internal market will not be harmonised .
In this respect , I must support the Commission proposal , which also includes Eurobonds in the regime .
In terms of the scope of the directive , the issue of Eurobonds was raised .
I understand that some Member States have reservations about the detail .
It would therefore also be appropriate to include specifications relating to tanks for non @-@ liquid fuels .
Directive 96 / 96 / EC established the principle that commercial road vehicles must undergo an annual roadworthiness test at an approved testing centre .
We believe that this is a little too rigid to be accepted in this form by governments , by our group and by this House , even more so as all states are calling for some flexibility in choosing their aid policies and in defining their territorial competences .
Finally , I cannot finish without mentioning some of the threats posed to workers &apos; rights that , to my mind , must not adapt to new technologies but should instead aim to guarantee an acceptable quality of life for all .
Their facilities will lose quantities of waste , perhaps to a neighbouring country with its cheaper solutions .
The reason why I am withholding my support is that I do not wish to contribute to any decision whereby policy on taxes and duties is determined to an ever @-@ increasing extent by the EU .
Mr President , I want to congratulate my colleague , Roberto Barzanti , who has always been an elegant and eloquent contributor to our debate .
We have to combat piracy , and the way to do so is through cooperation with the countries with whom we have dealings and other forms of association .
In order to continue to preserve and further enrich our artistic identity , our artists must be further encouraged .
It is about who wins control of this electronic marketplace , and a hard battle is being fought out there over this .
As far as the recitals are concerned , the Commission rejects Amendment No 3 which , in our view , confuses protected work and information in general and is contrary to the principles of the acquis communautaire ; the first part of Amendment No 13 which is incompatible with the WIPO treaty , though we accept the second part ; Amendment No 14 which does not , in our view , succeed in defining the concept of &apos; public &apos; , a responsibility we believe is best left to the Member States , which are in a better position to define this somewhat elastic term ; Amendment No 19 which does not correspond to the amendments tabled in relation to Article 5 ( 2 ) ( b ) ; Amendment No 23 because it calls into question the approach taken in the proposal to the exceptions ; Amendments Nos 27 and 28 which are already covered by the third recital ; and Amendments Nos 15 , 25 and 26 because they are too far outside the scope of the proposal .
I think it is particularly positive that flexibility is being preserved where new planting rights are concerned , and that a fair compromise has been found here .
It is based , as always in the field of agriculture , on the fallacy of overproduction .
Question No 40 by Willy De Clercq ( H @-@ 0091 / 99 )
I hope that opinions will be changed quickly , and the excellent stability programme presented yesterday by the Swedish Government and accepted by the Council of Ministers is an encouraging factor here .
In any case , our misgivings as to possible abuses of this nature have proved well founded .
Subject : Nuclear waste mismanagement Has the Commission examined the report on nuclear waste mismanagement at UK nuclear sites , drawn up by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and released in December 1998 , which sets out how the incompetent management of solid radioactive waste at Dounreay and Sellafield may affect the health of UK citizens and the environment of other EU Member States as a result of the leakage of radioactivity into the sea ?
Members are cut off at 1 minute while some of the answers from Commissioner van den Broek were very long @-@ winded .
And that is why - without wishing to start a revolution - we shall again be raising the issue of quality rather more seriously and consistently .

Mr President , I was thoroughly confused by Commissioner Fischler &apos;s explanation about imports of must from third countries for vinification .
The net is being widened somewhat too far if all these groups are to be given the status of refugees wishing to enter the European Union .
Madam President , the three reports on the crossing of EU borders , which are the subject of this joint debate , are very different .
I often go to Romania and Bulgaria myself .
Asylum policy in general and supplementary protection in particular will accordingly be the focus of considerable attention during the coming years .
What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander .
But in this context we must also give the Commission , as the motor of European integration and guardian of the Treaties , equal rights of participation in this international representation .
Clearly , what we really want is consensus , but decisions will have to be taken if we want Europe to work .
Europe still has to be able to adapt and reform itself .
I am sorry that the Council is not represented here because I think that it would learn from this debate and the points made during it .
Here we expect the Cologne European Council to consider our ideas too when it decides the timetable and methods of these reforms .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not rightly understand the meaning of all this paperwork and its timetable .
Encapsulating the catalogue of fundamental rights and social rights in a single vision , and developing programmes for freedom , security and justice is exactly the right way to set about promoting and actually achieving the concept of European citizenship introduced at Maastricht .
However , I have to say to those European citizens who are listening to us today in the public gallery that we turn our minds to them once every five years , just before the elections .
I would ask the President to protest strongly to the Council , on Parliament &apos;s behalf , at its absence during this morning &apos;s debate .
European authors , on the other hand , do not have the same sort of guarantee as in the United States , for example .
Capital moves around , even beyond Europe .
In fact , the proper rule which should be laid down is that when a text has been adopted unanimously , the failure of one Member State to give its support - by requesting that it be revised - must automatically lead to improvements being made to it .
Those who smuggle human beings and illegal organisations with Mafia connections make a great deal of money unlawfully and gamble with the lives of the asylum @-@ seekers whom they bring into the EU .
This is on top of other serious falls in 1996 and 1997 .
No .
Seven : the European Union is prepared to make its contribution to implementing a negotiated settlement .
There is always agreement that pressure must be kept up , and I share that view , but how can we apply pressure on the KLA to honour its commitments ?
No , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , Commissioner , we are looking at a part of a larger problem .
It points out that there are three different kinds of subregions , which must be consulted , must be involved in the decision @-@ making ; and here I believe the reference to new ACP negotiations is important .
He is right to call for attention to be paid to these regions which have just been described , and he looks , among other things , at the issues of trade and equal treatment with the ACP countries .
As President may I specifically state on behalf of the Council that it attaches the utmost value to protecting freedom of expression , of which the freedom of the media is one of the most important factors .
Mr Verheugen has offered to respond to you in writing .
Under the new rules the export controls have been relaxed .
The Council shares the concern expressed by the honourable Member and by Parliament as a whole in relation to the quality of life and especially the mobility of disabled citizens .
Let me specifically confirm again , Mrs Theorin , that in the presidency &apos;s view the Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty is one of the most important international instruments of disarmament and international security .
What can be more important to the future of the Community than secure and abundant supplies of healthy water .
Mr President , in my autonomous community of Aragon , we believe that our future depends on water .
As has been emphasised , Parliament has taken the reform of water policy very seriously , and I would like to take this opportunity to praise the substantial and very positive influence which Parliament has had both with regard to starting the reform and developing it further .
The PPE Group &apos;s decision at the final vote will depend on whether the disputed points , which we have also raised in committee , are properly clarified and agreed .
We tabled an amendment to precisely that effect in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , but unfortunately it was in vain .
An example of this is Amendment No 14 , which will simplify the monitoring and detection of GMOs .
At least this gives vehicle manufacturers an idea of the constraints to be imposed on them after 2005 .
Both questions lead us to the conclusion that we are pursuing an open market policy that is not reciprocated and that benefits the United States .
We will now continue to argue before the arbitrator that he can only determine the level of any retaliatory action if and when the non @-@ conformity of the new banana regime has been determined .
Although Israel , anticipating the conclusion of the agreement , began to contribute financially and submitted tenders , subject to conclusion , in 1996 , the bulk of the funds for many programmes had already been allocated by that time .
We could therefore be dealing with the most extreme and most abominable type of racism ever experienced .
Israel &apos;s recent policies in certain respects have shown regrettable shifts .
These international rules include the MARPOL Protocol , and the proposal for a directive transposes its provisions into Community law . These include reducing dumping at sea , improving port reception facilities , stepping up monitoring in order to force vessels to hand over their waste , and establishing a system to fund these facilities .
We recall in this House that he has fastidiously pursued the questions raised by the disastrous wreck of the Pallas in international waters .
I will defend these points in the meetings we will hold with the Council and the Commission up until the vote on the legislative resolution .
This debate brings to light several fundamental points , dealing with both the nature of the common agricultural policy and the actual running of the European institutions .
Coordination of macroeconomic regulation is essential , but it is important that the EU does not deprive the Member States of the responsibility which they are obliged to live up to as members of the economic and monetary union .
For once , I shall abstain from voting .
This is a huge opportunity to safeguard the future of Ireland &apos;s clean green image of food production .
Madam President , on behalf of my Group , I wish to say how profoundly disappointed we were in the conduct of the recent presidential elections in Kazakhstan .
This is exactly what Ethiopia has been doing for some time , arrogantly disregarding all advice or agreements , simply because it enjoys political support in the world .
There is an international Peltier Committee , of which I , for example , am a member and which has been dealing with the case for many years .
We will be supporting that during the vote but unfortunately I will not be here because of the difficult timing of flights out of Strasbourg , so I have to leave before the vote .
It is vital to observe the Abuja agreement and rapidly establish ECOMOG , the peace @-@ keeping force of the Economic Community of West African States .
In my view , the same thing has happened with this earthquake in Columbia as happened with Hurricane Mitch . As usual , it is the poorest people that are affected .
So I intend to take the vote .
This explanation of vote is mainly concerned with those sections of the report dealing with PVC .
Further details will be provided by the committees involved .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a.m .
It is essential to protect the objectives of an operation designed to underpin stability and economic reform .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it was essential to find another date for the mini @-@ session , because otherwise the Commission would have had to be in two places at once - with us in Brussels to hear Parliament &apos;s assessment of the report of the committee of wise men , and in Berlin discussing Agenda 2000 with the Council .
I wonder whether there is another problem with this report there .
Madam President , on a point of order .
But the general line adopted seems to be satisfactory .
Mr President , the Commission is very busy .
Norway recently came forward with a plan to treat 20 rivers with rotenone .
Secondly , where does it say in the Rules of Procedure that with the agreement of the President the Secretary @-@ General can cancel duly convened parliamentary sittings or other meetings ?
In my view it is true that the PKK has discredited itself by its acts of terrorism and violence .
This House has never expressed the slightest support for the actions of this man and his PKK , however tragic and hopeless the fate of the Kurds might have seemed .
We call on Turkey - and will not cease to do so - to change its approach and seek a political solution to the problem , to take a political approach to the problem of the Kurds and the rights of the Kurds - and here I entirely agree with what you said on the matter .
The Commission has not expressed the wish to do so .
We are not just opposed to the quantity of these products . Our opposition is chiefly aimed at labelling , which sparked off this dispute .
The directives on working time must now cover every sector of transport .
I also think that we can agree on certain solutions , but when it comes to decisions in the Council , that is when things slow down .
Commissioner , the European Parliament for its part is prepared to promote cooperation in other areas too , in addition to the areas covered by this Heinisch report , so that the European Union can successfully complete all its unfinished homework - here I am thinking mainly of financial aid .
Socrates programme ( second phase )
Clearly , we are going to have to go on fighting the Council of Ministers .
As a university teacher I can only endorse , year after year , what Doris Pack has described in general terms and has rightly highlighted as positive , as well as what she has rightly criticised .
If we were to accept these amendments , the minimum excise duty on loose tobacco for those who hand @-@ roll their own cigarettes would rise drastically , which would make sudden 30 % price increases inevitable .
They only affect one per cent , which is precisely the share of the market that is still in the hands of small and medium @-@ sized businesses .
There was to be fairness , maintenance of dependent areas , a traditional way of life , stabilised markets , reasonable prices , relations organised within the Community and with third countries .
The draft looked at how more local involvement in resource management and conservation measures might best be achieved and called for the existing regionalisation to be consolidated and expanded through the creation of regional management units .
It means that a publication by the inventor himself or herself will not prejudice the granting of a patent to the same person .
For this reason , the Commission is grateful to the House , and in particular the rapporteur , for having taken this initiative .
Our prime concern is to encourage innovation in those companies which are not large enough to devote time , money and human resources to deal systematically , and primarily on their own initiative , with innovative developments .
To conclude , I would like to point out that the approach that I am proposing , which should enable us to find an intermediary solution while we are waiting for the latest revision of the 1994 packaging directive , is supported by all of the packaging sectors and by the consumers &apos; associations , and it seems that the majority of Member States will agree to it .
Amendments Nos 2 and 21 are also acceptable , since they clarify and complement the proposal .
We all have to do that .
I therefore support the declaration of ingredients on all food items .
What measures are being taken across the European Union to have a coordinated response and to ensure that proper information is going to the public services in this area ?
A thought did occur to me .
Anyone who makes a mistake when supplying a product or service must of course take responsibility if it is a culpable error or if there is no @-@ fault liability .
The third point is the question of the committee itself .
When the EU adopts provisions on the environment and the working environment as such , they apply as minimum provisions under which we all have the right to go further .
Mr President , I find myself in the same position as Mr Ephremidis .
For the reasons given above , we voted against the report in the final vote .
We also cannot ignore the importance and necessity of helping to consolidate a regime which has allowed South Africa to regain its national dignity and which is trying to eradicate racism .
However , the quality of his work and the relevance of his proposals encouraged the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations to support his report .
They want to see some money .
Parliament rejected the request
A number of Member States made it clear that they were opposed to Article 235 as the legal base for the programme .
Lastly , the Daphne programme also covers violence against children and young people .
The Europe which we create must be one of culture !
This topic must not be deferred any longer .
The measures taken up to now have not had an effect in all areas or on the direction in which Community policy is going .
I hope the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights will remain vigilant , because we need that committee .
We hope that in a few months &apos; time the Amsterdam Treaty will be ratified by all 15 Member States , thereby making equality of opportunity between women and men an overarching goal in our Treaty .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the present report on implementing the principle of equal treatment for men and women provides a good opportunity for asking some crucial questions about women &apos;s policy .
It needs to draw up internal rules that will be compatible and consistent with the Treaty when it enters into force . It is this Treaty of course which establishes the guidelines for the development of these internal statutes .
They are the internal constitution of this institution ; they summarise and reflect how Parliament wishes to present itself and the role it sees for itself in the interinstitutional balance . They represent all that Parliament has stood for throughout its short but fruitful history , and anticipate the part it would like to play in the process of European integration .
Have they been strengthened or weakened here ?
That is the result !
They cannot be bent to the dictates of the political climate . Their reliability depends on consistency in their daily interpretation and application .
The intention here is to respond to the demands of efficiency and demands of an ethical nature .
I am very glad that some Members also spoke in favour of a special committee , during the debate .
In addition , because some Member States have already introduced the appropriate legislation , the Commission proposal aims to define common principles at a Community level so as to avoid the introduction of non @-@ homogeneous legal frameworks .
At least now an attempt has been made to pinpoint the problems and outline possible approaches for political action in the future .
It is absurd to posit a so @-@ called women &apos;s right to go against the right to life , which applies to everyone .
You should realise that the defence of women is simply rhetoric when not confirmed by the facts .
That could quite easily be the case , and GM foods are only one example of it .
A recent conference in Vienna concluded that the biological effects from low @-@ intensity exposure are scientifically established , so it is no longer acceptable for Member State governments or the Commission to say that more research is required before setting standards .
I finish by thanking all those who have contributed to the communication and to the publication of this report and have worked so hard to take EU health policies to this stage from where we can look forward confidently to the road ahead .
We obviously have to act against this , taking advantage of the Treaty of Amsterdam , in which employment was placed at the centre of Community policy .
Bananas
The USA announced and began this massive campaign for free trade a long time ago , without regard for human health or the environment .
We have already given in to the World Trade Organisation on many occasions .
Since there were heated disputes about the instrument of cofinancing , I submitted a compromise proposal to the Committee on Budgets .
Only if the contribution of each individual taxpayer throughout Europe is taken seriously and evaluated could this dispute be brought to an end .
The European Union cannot maintain its ceiling of 1.27 % of GNP and so we will ultimately end up with additional European taxes .
What I have been hearing about the representative in Nicaragua is indicative that the project had not been properly closed down .
Sometimes subsidies are paid to canned @-@ tomato producers because the price at which they have to purchase tomatoes is higher than the international average price .
In the long term , therefore , continuity and consistency will be the main themes in our forthcoming proposal . As a result , our contribution will build on the previous plan , but it will include an evaluation of what has been accomplished during the last five @-@ year period .
The equivalent of the sum that has been announced amounts to unilaterally estimated losses of EURO 508 million .
What concerns me most , and what I would like your opinion on , is whether the provisions of the directive were adhered to , in particular as regards transparency and the actual use to which public funds were put .
What are we really talking about here ?
We must accept that contributions are determined by the single market as a whole and not just by the Community budget .
That is why the 1996 decision taken by the Council and Parliament is sensibly entitled &apos; Guidelines for the development of the trans @-@ European transport network &apos; .
What is being proposed in this project - in my view nothing short of a revolution in the world of transport in my country , which is why I ask both the European Parliament and the Commission to support it - will enable Portugal to overhaul its transport system and create a logical and complementary network that will link up the different means of transport and modernise every form of access to the Portuguese ports . That means that we will be on a new cutting edge of development .
Mr President , I will be extremely brief because I am conscious of the fact that unavoidably my first contribution was long .
We must solve the problems of this process together with our citizens .
First of all , on behalf of my group , I would like to thank Pavlos Sarlis and Hannes Swoboda for their work in this very important area .
That is why we have to reject Amendment No 4 , which would , in practice , have removed this specific requirement .
When the Commission tabled this proposal , we took due account of the technical difficulties that could arise from fitting these instruments on board existing ships and craft and we therefore made the provision that the committee could agree on exemptions from some of the technical requirements that VDRs have to comply with .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11 a.m .
Over the last few weeks , however , it has been possible to make significant progress on the necessary preliminary work which is intended to prepare the ground for the Berlin summit .
It added that it was prepared to make the necessary proposals if there were signs that the Member States could reach an agreement .
Mr President , the Agenda 2000 negotiations now under way are among the most difficult which the European Union has faced as an institution and political entity since the foundation of the European Economic Community .
Given the diversity of the issues and the fact that they are crucial to the EU &apos;s future , compromises are obviously going to be necessary , as they are in any democratic system .
I make the plea that we continue to support this .
Mr President , the last comments were about lacking vision - I just want to make a comment about losing sight of something : the interinstitutional agreement .
Now is the only time it actually can be discussed .
At the same time , the inglorious Lord Owen - of whom we all still have painful memories from the war in Bosnia - puts in an appearance and makes the abstruse proposal actually to offer Milosevic compensation for Kosovo by separating Republika Srpska from the State of Bosnia , which is recognised under international law , and allowing him to annex it .
But ultimately a political solution must of course be preferably to a military one .
That would provide central and northern Portugal with rail and port infrastructures as well as a complete road network once extensions have been made to the IP5 highway , which is scheduled for rapid conversion into a motorway , as planned in the annex .
On the contrary , the very highest levels of passenger safety must be achieved .
Neither the reports nor the package of proposals put forward by the Commission make any reference to the impact these measures will have on rail sector workers .
Just as environmental policy has a cross @-@ border dimension , public health policy has a European dimension .
Equally , the Committee on Budgetary Control has long had a deep interest , a concern that arises from the fact that something in the order of 54 cents in the dollar of the Middle East peace process is financed by the European Union budget .
As a result , I cannot promise the chairman of the Committee on Budgets that there will be 100 % funding for the financial programme .
We are dealing with very different countries , but isolation will not solve problems which should instead be entrusted to the wisdom of politicians : Libya should teach us a lesson .
However , our Mediterranean policy is our most neglected , irresolute and ineffectual policy .
So I shall use my minute and a half - which , as the speaker before last said , is somewhat ludicrous given the important points needing to be made - to express a few thoughts to Mr Marín , but not without first thanking Mr Sakellariou and Mr Colajanni for their remarkable work , which thoroughly covers every aspect needing to be covered .
They want to earn money and they want access to a liberal market on different terms from those we wish to see .
Another essential component will be the revision of regulatory standards by the Western European regulatory authorities with the involvement of the International Atomic Energy Agency and the European Commission .
Mr President , would you please be so good as to ask the Commission to be present this evening for the debate on this very important topic ?
Question No 4 by Paul Rübig ( H @-@ 0116 / 99 )
It is not something that can be decided at European level because the Member States are not currently willing to transfer the decision to European level .
I must therefore say that I see very , very few ways of exerting a positive influence on Turkey .
I think it is important that the European Central Bank should operate transparently .
We cannot make any exceptions for nuclear power stations .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m .
Some initial steps have been taken under the fifth framework programme on research , but more needs to be done .
I also expect , Commissioner , that during accession negotiations you will pursue a strategy of increased use of renewable energy sources , because the other countries have signed up to the European Union &apos;s Kyoto objectives and the first six applicants , which will already be Member States at the relevant point in time , will have to comply with these objectives in exactly the same way .
I do not accept them for that reason , and not because there is opposition to them in principle .
In the end , the result of such behaviour from banks will be that many people , many normal people , will come to the conclusion that the euro is not a single currency that has replaced the currencies of the 11 Member States participating in monetary union but that it is just one extra currency . It is another currency on top of their own currencies that still exist in practically the same conditions as before the euro was introduced .
Leaf tobacco
France , Germany , Belgium and Austria are not countries so poor or with soil so poor that no other crops can grow there .
However , and this is the important point , we need to approach this in a serious and rational manner . Although the proposal that we are now considering has been presented by the European Commission , it was not actually prepared by the Commission , but by European Parliament officials .
Amendments Nos 1 , 4 , 5 and 11 refer to the rules governing Members &apos; expenses and allowances .
I would like to highlight one of the aspects that other speakers have mentioned , which is the conservative attitude adopted by some countries .
That is really the central problem for us .
It is as simple as that .
This has nothing to do with Keynesianism , which is often misunderstood .
As regards the state of the European economy , I share the rapporteur &apos;s view that the European economy is affected by the world crisis .
The debate is closed .
I understand that people who work for us , such as the freelance interpreters , have not been paid since October .
But that is not the same thing as a fiscal policy decided by the EU , in which the EU takes control of the taxes raised .
The Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations opposes this standardisation as , in our view , such a statute should remain under the remit of each country .
Finally , I agree with the ideas on human rights and balanced development , which must be major objectives for those countries wishing to join the European Union .
The Commission also shares your feelings regarding the conditions under which this accident took place and , like many of you , regarding the questions that remain unanswered .
Castro - and I should know , I lived there for four years - is no good .
They have received political recognition - including at international level - but we must ask them to respect international humanitarian law . We must ask them to release all kidnapped civilians , some of whom are ill .
Our motion recognises that poverty is a fundamental obstacle to the realisation of human rights .

The Commission is concerned to devise a Community policy which will both remove the incentive for flagging @-@ out and harmonise market conditions for seafarers .
All the institutions have expressed the will to tackle this issue , but often the problem has been that it has been hard to find practical ways of achieving this aim at Union level .
All of these issues can be put on the agenda if there is a stronger partnership between India and the EU .
I should like to congratulate Mrs André @-@ Léonard very strongly on her excellent report which sets out very comprehensively the many social and political issues which face India .
You may have the floor , but only if it is on a different matter .
As far as Brcko is concerned , neutrality is certainly better than annexing it to Serbia against the will of the people , but this neutrality can only be a transitional solution .
The draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents pursuant to Rule 95 of the Rules of Procedure has been distributed .
Applause
Happily the Commissioners do not stand accused either of fraud or of lining their own pockets , but there is the fateful passage in the Wise Men &apos;s report , paragraph 9.9.2 ..
Thirdly , a procedure for the award of contracts must be introduced which is totally transparent and is addressed to genuine professionals .
We all know that , without political union , economic union will remain wishful thinking , useful only to powerful lobbies but remote from - if not detrimental to - the needs of the European people .
How can that be ensured ?
The task would have to be delegated to the new incoming Parliament .
That schedule suits us perfectly .
It is about the whole management structure of the Commission ; the relationship between the staff and their directors ; the relationship between the directors and the directors @-@ general ; the relationship between the directors @-@ general and the Commissioners and their cabinets .
The current Parliament can inform the new Commission of the reforms that are required .
So the crisis that has developed over the last three months must be laid very firmly at the feet of Mrs Green .
If what we have now is not adequate , then we need to carry out whatever reforms are necessary .
We came to the conclusion that humanitarian aid has to continue and that cooperation with the authorities there must improve , so that the help we offer can be more effective .
Finally , I welcome the paragraph in the report that asks for a delegation to come here from the DPRK &apos;s Parliament .
As for the substance of what has been said , I am absolutely dumbstruck .
However , the rapporteur does not fail to point out the weaknesses , the naivety and the omissions that characterise this plan , which has been adopted in fits and starts .
Despite the progress made - which certainly deserves recognition - much remains to be done concerning certain specific features of the procedures , such as the strict observance of the terms of any injunction and of the time allowed to evaluate a complaint or a petition , and giving plaintiffs the opportunity to have access to legal arguments which could affect the final decision on a complaint so as to facilitate possible appeals . All these issues will have to given serious consideration in the near future , in the interests of legal efficiency and of the transparency of proceedings as well as to guarantee the credibility of non @-@ compliance procedures in the eyes of the public .
A second amendment , which I have tabled on behalf of my group , reformulates this concept as a recital , adding that the present system - the one providing the transition to the definitive system , as it were - has a whole series of drawbacks , including the ones briefly listed in my explanatory statement .
But even when the Commission was still more able to act than it is now , I doubted whether you could produce that green paper on time .
It should be borne in mind that producers often build up a particular atmosphere or context to make consumption of their product appear natural and normal . In such circumstances , it should not be up to the consumer alone to produce the evidence , when there is general awareness that the disease has resulted from dangerous methods of production .
This state of affairs is particularly regrettable since the European Union is a regional organisation based on the principles of peace and cooperation . As such , it has an automatic vocation to establish links and to promote the United Nations .
As I see it , his aim is to identify a way of changing direction and establishing some kind of balance between the leading players and civil society .
In future we need first and foremost a clearer attributability of success and responsibility , not just at Commissioner level but indeed also at official level , not just in the Commission but also in the European Parliament .
Mr Chairman we live in the age between the ages as Reinhold Niebuhr said , and other colleagues have made that point very clearly .
Be that as it may , speaking as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy on the budget for 2000 , I would like to recall the three basic points made by the committee in respect of the new budget .
Thirdly , after consultation with , amongst others , the German presidency and the British Home Office , I have been more specific about some of the tasks which this new committee should carry out .
Leonardo da Vinci programme
Why seven years for the programme ?
The debate is closed .
Mrs Boogerd @-@ Quaak , if I have understood correctly , you are asking for this vote to be postponed pursuant to Rule 131 .
Thank you , Mrs Palm .
The reasons are well known and have been known to everyone for years : nepotism , serious irregularities , &apos; fraud &apos; , &apos; lack of control of the bureaucratic administration &apos; and other oligarchical excesses , which have been condemned here by Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen &apos;s Front National members for the last three legislative periods .
For we are in fact looking at two things here . On the one hand we are looking at external security , for which we must now be prepared to give something .
Mr President , as you have now come to the end of the amendments to the agenda , I am struck by the fact - and I think it will come as some surprise to the public that is following the debates of this Parliament - that , though the issues on the agenda are important and interesting , we are nevertheless facing a war in Yugoslavia !
The national parliaments must be involved in European justice policy and lastly , and I say this from the Liberal point of view , we need to have a European Commissioner with responsibility for this area , and one who has muscle .
Furthermore , problems have arisen of people being held for long periods without trial because of bureaucratic delays caused by translation problems and because of the lack of proper legal aid .
Otherwise , how are we going to arrest those involved in child pornography who are so unbalanced as to end up actually committing the act because of having constantly watched pornographic tapes involving adults ?
The anti @-@ drugs strategies come under three pillars ; we have several action plans and a variety of reports on the drugs problem .
At the same time , I also know that there is a sense of justice throughout Europe which demands vigorous action to end all aspects of child exploitation .
I am also referring to the convention on rules for the admission of third @-@ country nationals .
We are not only fighting for ourselves and for all those who have had the misfortune to be born with the wrong papers ; we are also fighting to strengthen the democratic foundations of our societies .
One might ask oneself whether this is really the outcome of a conference attended by 15 ministers : an expression of thanks to Albania and a statement to the effect that we are prepared to provide protection for refugees from the Kosovo region .
Two specific questions remain in relation to the reports .
A4 @-@ 0131 / 99 , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council Decision on a series of guidelines , including the identification of projects of common interest , for trans @-@ European networks for the electronic interchange of data between administrations ( IDA ) ( 13490 / 2 / 98 - C4 @-@ 0017 / 99 @-@ 97 / 0340 ( COD ) ) ( Rapporteur : Mrs Read ) and @-@ A4 @-@ 0130 / 99 , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a Council Decision adopting a series of actions and measures in order to ensure interoperability of and access to trans @-@ European networks for the electronic Interchange of Data between Administrations ( IDA ) ( 13491 / 2 / 98 - C4 @-@ 0012 / 99 @-@ 97 / 0341 ( SYN ) ) ( Rapporteur : Mrs Read ) .
He is one of a number of Commissioners in the present caretaker college whose resignation because of circumstances not to do with himself I deeply regret .
I should like , first of all , to present my apologies to you , Madam President , as well as to all Members of Parliament in the Chamber at this time , in particular to Mr Harrison and Mr Cox , the two rapporteurs .
However , I do not want to continue this discussion now .
The proposals which the Commission has made are in line with the same stability policy which has already been pursued in preceding price packages .
Although you also complimented Mr Jové Peres , Commissioner , I do have to say that his proposals are somewhat premature .
Firstly , the price adjustment must apply to all agricultural products and not just cereals , sugar and beet , butter and skimmed @-@ milk powder and adult bovine animals .
Our agri @-@ food industry also represents a high value added .
Europe has a great cultural tradition ; it has a great wealth of scientific knowledge stored in its universities and research centres .
The conclusions of the Berlin Summit asked this Parliament to deal with the nomination of Mr Prodi and the new Parliament to deal with the ratification of the entire new Commission .
Like Michel Rocard and many others , I am a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation .
This , ladies and gentlemen , gives rise to a situation which is politically untenable for us and unworthy of the European Parliament .
I am very much aware of Mr Rübig &apos;s amendment , I approve of it and I recommend to the House that we vote in favour .
So this joint action , including practical cooperation which also involves Internet service providers , should begin as soon as possible .
And also from this date these matters will come under the competence of the Community , which can only be welcomed .
We have no time to lose on this .
It is therefore surprising that the Commission has stated that there is no time to implement an effective system this season because the procedure to establish a global quota and change tariffs in the World Trade Organisation has not been initiated .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
As far as the protection of certain interest groups is concerned , we really have to say once again that this is a problem in any case because , for example , the freedom of the press is not the freedom of the newspaper owner , but the freedom of journalists .
In conclusion , in this age of globalisation , it would be unthinkable not to step up - and indeed to maximise - the involvement of employees in Community undertakings , because obviously business success or failure ultimately depends on them .
Turning very briefly to Mr Chanterie &apos;s report I would like to congratulate him on his work and thank him for the discussions that we have had .
Junior doctors play a critical role in patient care .
The agreement reached between the social partners largely reflects the content of the Convention with regard to the minimum hours of rest , as well as introducing new provisions on health assessments and annual leave .
The most controversial area is the issue of doctors in training .
Mr Torres Couto &apos;s report mainly concerns developing countries , and this report by Mr Galeote Quecedo relates to other countries .
These amendments , previously adopted at first reading by Parliament , were not incorporated into the Council &apos;s common position . This is to be regretted .
My colleagues from the Socialist Group have tabled amendments to the effect that the requirements which I propose to apply in respect of existing plants by the year 2005 should be postponed to the year 2010 .
Problems concerning older plants obviously depend on which energy source is used by which Member State , and these vary enormously .
The new Commission proposal is a good one , but can be improved in one or two respects .
The first of these is the desire to ensure an administrative simplification of the texts , and therefore have one directive instead of two .
We have to look at the real options of dealing with waste : reduction , reuse , recycle .
The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12 , 16 , 17 , 21 and 22 , which seek to introduce provisions on quality standards for air and water .
We also agree wholeheartedly with the Committee on the Environment &apos;s view that priority should be given to cross @-@ border projects , to innovative projects and to projects generating employment .
This Parliament has defined best available technology very precisely for industry and has also - rightly , in my opinion - excluded SMEs from this .
The Commission therefore does not support Amendments Nos 16 , 17 , 52 and 63 , because they weaken the transparency and control of information concerning environmental outcomes by reducing the validation frequency .
I would hope that in your retirement you will recognise that you have made a considerable contribution to the development of these programmes .
The introduction of the euro was a major step towards integration .
Sustained applause
But we should ensure that the discussions are substantive .
The Franco @-@ German engine simply does not run on milk .
We welcome the agreement to designate Romano Prodi as president @-@ in @-@ waiting .
Let me say quite plainly that first and foremost we should provide assistance in situ .
I therefore repeat my insistence , for the benefit of the Council , that the new European Commission must be able to get down to work as quickly as possible and before the European elections .
Madam President , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office , I believe that the majority of our colleagues feel that the European Council worked hard in Berlin .
Parliament has already had talks with Mr Prodi , so an invitation did not seem necessary .
Madam President , I just wanted to propose that we should congratulate the President of the sitting for beating all the speed records for the votes .
This debate has the wrong title .
We had suggested a late date , namely the year 2020 .
Mr President , it will take a long time to correctly assess the position taken by Europe in the tragedy of Kosovo , and it will not be done before the deafening bombing and the lamentations of the refugees have stopped ringing in our ears .
Just as he was given 50 % of Bosnian territory at Dayton , this will give him 50 % of Kosovan territory , obviously completely cleared of any Kosovar presence .
How is the Council going to prevent the formation of a greater Albania ?
Why did we abandon the pacifist Rugova in order to support a guerrilla movement about which we know precious little ?
The EU must see to it that the UN special tribunal on Yugoslavia swiftly undertakes investigations into war crimes that have been committed . Equally , countries need to be encouraged to ratify the agreement setting up the International Criminal Court , so that we have an instrument to deal with war crimes in the future .
In the first place , this crisis shows us that in complex situations such as Hurricane Mitch in Central America it is sometimes impossible for aid workers to cope without the assistance of military structures .
Parliament should say so , loud and clear , to the Council of Ministers .
Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt is not here , but I trust the term &apos; heavyweight &apos; does not offend her .
Mr Alavanos , I understand your disappointment , but all the presidency can tell you is what the Member States are prepared to do and in this case the situation is that a number of Member States have very fundamental reservations about this programme to promote European tourism ; they do not want it at all .
Subject : Island regions in the new context of the Amsterdam Treaty Article 158 of the Amsterdam Treaty sets out the Community &apos;s aim of reducing the backwardness of the least favoured regions or islands , and Declaration 30 annexed to the said Treaty recognises that &apos; island regions suffer from structural handicaps linked to their island status , the permanence of which impairs their economic and social development &apos; .
Thank you , Mr President @-@ in @-@ Office .
Question No 17 by Vassilis Ephremidis ( H @-@ 0254 / 99 )
Their causes are both long @-@ standing and deep @-@ rooted .
May I take this opportunity to thank him very sincerely on behalf of the Commission for his exceptionally energetic and creative work , including in cooperation with the Commission .
Therefore , Mr President , I have one last request : we need to make haste !
I have not seen any gesture at all from Northern Cyprus of course , nor from Turkey either .
Because if we did discourage them , the reform process and the momentum in these countries would founder , which would be bad both for these countries and for the European Union .
What is also needed , as the Czechs pointed out , is enlightened imagination and political courage .
Before I comment on individual countries I should like to make a number of general points about these four important criteria which , as you know , were agreed in Copenhagen in 1993 .
These then are the proposals .
This is simply how I see it .
Thirdly , I should like to refer to the idea of a code of good administrative behaviour , which was first mentioned in the Perry report on the Committee on Petitions &apos; own activities for 1996 @-@ 1997 and supported in the Newman report on the Ombudsman &apos;s annual report for 1997 .
Mr President , Parliament this week has been debating very many important issues , such as war and peace in Kosovo .
The facts have borne this man out , yet the Commission still feels it necessary to continue with disciplinary proceedings against him , and he has been removed from his post in the financial control department where he had done some excellent work .
Madam President , I completely agree with Mr Söderman that if the EU had had a culture of open administration , whereby the public could inspect the files of its officials once they have been finalised , we would be able to avoid a great deal of fraud and many irregularities .
Against that background the Customs 2000 programme is absolutely essential to demonstrate that we are more than simply a group of individual countries working in a general area .
Traffic jams , accidents and environmental pollution , of course , are caused just as much by private cars as by commercial vehicles .
In other words , according to the initial proposal , this committee would be called the &apos; Committee on Transport , Regional Policy and Tourism &apos; .
This is completely lacking in the Seychelles agreement ( we also urge the Member States to speedily ratify this convention - thus far only Italy has done so ) .
This is why , in the case of Serbia and Kosovo , after 10 years of negotiations that were punctuated by human rights violations , rapes , massacres , destruction and deportation - which were always instigated by Milosevic - there was unfortunately no alternative to the use of force to put an end to these crimes .
This vital redefinition of our concept of Europe will be the best possible preventive policy .
This is a field where there is clearly no doubt about the jurisdiction of the European Union , particularly in relation to the distortions that occur when different criteria are applied from one country to another , no matter whether this happens close to or far from borders , as in some countries users pay for infrastructure through fuel taxes and tolls , and in others it is financed from the public purse .
Experience in a number of Member States has shown this to be the case .
As I have said , the Commission is already looking at these important issues within a broader framework and has undertaken to deal with them appropriately , including , among other things , all the expectations relating to bearer protection .
I am also grateful to Mr Fayot , Mr Herman and Mr Katiforis for their kind words : needless to say , I am greatly touched by them .
The first is the maintenance of restrictions on HGV traffic and their harmonisation on the basis of the most widespread current restrictions .
At the moment , it is not clear what extra freight capacity the railways can offer on the Alpine routes , but the Commission expects them to take advantage of the commercial opportunities .
No crisis gives any government the right to violate the rights of its people , and the Burmese Government must understand that its leaders will be held personally responsible for the suffering that they cause .
The parliament has been dissolved and the army has seized almost total power for itself .
So on that basis , I shall vote for the proposal for a decision as amended .
If control is not exercised by Parliament , then there is no control .
It is the largest and most populous of the applicant countries and expressed its legitimate wish to join the European Union in 1994 , although negotiations did not really begin until four years later .
We support the principle of creating fair competition between different modes of transport .
This is why I would urge that considerable scope should be offered to the NGOs working in these areas , but we must also not forget the scant resources that our judicial authorities often have to work with , not to mention the lack of European @-@ level coordination .
It is an important tool in the fight against violence .
The citizens of Europe do not understand why a Commission , which resigned two months ago , is going to continue for another nine months .
Ladies and gentlemen , I suggest we move on from this surrealism and return to the relaxed state of mind we usually enjoy on Fridays .
It affects a disproportionately large number of older people .
Work must adapt to people &apos;s skills and abilities , rather than insisting that people adapt to the demands of work .
There will undoubtedly be people who are weary of their work or who have performed demanding and strenuous work over the years and want to retire , but surely the law cannot say to a person &apos; Thou shalt not work &apos; merely because he or she has reached the age of 60 , 65 and sometimes only 55 .
Further , several comments have implied that the level of aid is not sufficient .
I have heard talk of schemes to transform Venice into a new model of residential settlement : there is no need . It is simply a matter of refurbishing the 10 000 abandoned dwellings which are crumbling into the lagoon .
The Quaestors have interpreted them correctly .
The debate is closed .
According to the Treaties , Parliament takes the decision on discharge by a simple majority .
In recent months , we have on occasions had a robust discussion on which way to go : should we have an expansive policy as advocated by the Social Democrat group , along the lines of what Mr Lafontaine would like , or should we stick to the rules that we agreed ?
We cannot go on having economic guidelines which preach budgetary discipline and at the same time guidelines on employment which are subordinate to them .
We all know that the structure of the economy differs widely in the various Member States .
This dialogue should fully respect the autonomy of the various actors and take place at different levels as suggested in the draft resolution before Parliament today .
The Commission is not the only place where there are problems .
For all those who have worked on OLAF this has been an encouraging experience , which also bodes well for future cooperation .
This is a long @-@ term task for all those who are responsible for managing Community funds .
Since this is a joint debate , I do not wish to conclude without stating that my delegation - my delegation and I myself - have already made our position on the 1996 budget discharge quite clear . Further , the resignation of the Commission cannot now be used as an excuse to disregard the commitments made by Mr Santer .
It must be said that from our side we believe that the rapporteur is playing petty party politics with the whole question of discharge for 1996 .
We have thus tabled Amendment No 1 , in which we give the alternative wording : &apos; takes note of the following data established by the Commission in order to close the accounts for the financial year 1996 &apos; .
A decision was taken to freeze all the nominations until the code of conduct was accepted .
I believe that this report responds to these ideas .
We want very much to comply with them , but we need to have some input into them and we need to develop them further where dispute settlement is concerned , as well as in the social and environmental fields and in the fields of health and culture .
I fear that her interpretation to the contrary bore a whiff of the electoral campaign rather than the exercise of pure reason , because the point I made was a very simple one : as long as the ban exists , there can be no risk to health because meat with hormones is not allowed into the European Union .
As Mr van Velzen and Mrs Thyssen said , there is a major obstacle .
Are there any comments ?
However , some of the decision @-@ making procedures are very complicated and difficult to understand .
There is a European vacuum . And nature , as we learned at school , abhors a vacuum .
We need a transparent Commission , with ready public access to documents , and that requires swift implementation of Article 255 of the Amsterdam Treaty .
We expect you to be proactive in exercising your prerogatives as President of the Commission , not only as guardian of the Treaties and of the acquis communautaire , but we also expect a bold initiative to carry forward the completion of the institutional structure , so as to give the Europe of the euro a real personality , identity and strength .
These three factors are required if we are to be accepted by the public .
You are therefore being called upon to produce a new outline in order to create a new European social and ecological model .
The opening @-@ up of trade over the past few years has led to growth in certain countries which were totally outside the world economy before , and has consequently led - I understand this , and it has emerged in the debate - to serious problems in certain European sectors and certain European countries .
This is not currently the case .
The rapporteur also has my support in calling for public / private investment to obtain a modern transport and communications infrastructure in the Union and I support his call to the Commission and the Council to find the appropriate financing mechanism - such as an expanded role for the EIB .
Instead I am going to give the expected explanation of vote on the Elles report . We approved this report particularly because of its first paragraph - please stay Mr Dell &apos;Alba , just for a few more moments - and although I agree that this paragraph is not entirely realistic , its political significance is very clear in our opinion .
The idea of a Europe of integration was formed to fight this nationalist Europe with its dreadful experiences .
If the expulsions continue there will be a massive problem .
Milosevic is playing for time .
Mr President , the killings and ethnic cleansing are continuing in Kosovo .
European integration , the origins of which also lie in war in Europe , as I well remember , is now in a situation where Community institutions are defending and excusing NATO and its armed interventions .
But calling it a policy is going a little too far .
Milosevic is responsible for this war , which I hope will be the last round of violence .
For this reason I am confident that the strategy can be adopted in Cologne .
The effect of this majority decision making will be to reduce the power of national parliaments , and that must be counterbalanced by an increase in influence for the European Parliament .
We also believe that this common strategy towards Russia must be adopted at the next meeting of the European Council in Cologne .
Where we have underperformed is in the area of crisis management .
Nevertheless , the Liberal Group have tabled an amendment that many Members are prepared to support .
Equal pay is a nice principle , but the countries are not yet the same , and at the moment it is more important to get rid of Parliament &apos;s wastefulness .
If we do not succeed in safeguarding individual MEPs &apos; freedom of decision we cannot claim to be able to accomplish anything for the people of Europe .
For the coming budget year , this means that the decision taken to completely clear the promotion backlog will lead to upgradings for 26.5 % of staff with scope for promotion .
Our role is to ensure that there is transparency .
The explanation given by some administrative services to the effect that we knew this last week and anticipated it , and that we considered last week what we wished to do , may be all very interesting from a legal theory point of view , but it is not acceptable for us to have a first reading today , for a report to be referred to the Committee on Transport when it is not meeting , and for the administration to amend my report from last week and to say that it is a second reading report .
Madam President , it is quite some time ago that I was rapporteur on the general directive , the parent directive if you like , on distance selling to consumers .
The extra costs which this directive may create , if it becomes too complex and bureaucratic , will in the end always be imposed on the consumer .
Sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees
In other words , it is not surprising that administrative costs are so high , although they should be reduced where possible .
It should lead us in Parliament to realise that directives of a technical nature may also have a political content which cannot be left to a committee of experts .
Moreover , with the application of the new Treaty , this agreement marks the end of what could be termed a test or trial period for the codecision procedure and Parliament &apos;s role as a co @-@ legislator .
This is what we are doing and we will have to continue our humanitarian work for a very long time .
They are more aware of that than they are of the Treaty of Amsterdam , since , as a Spanish journalist said , the Treaty is colourless , odourless and bland .
More importantly , it has become much more firmly anchored in European public opinion than any previous European Parliament , and that is the crucial difference .
It is more important than ever to maintain and develop constructive and close political , economic and commercial dialogue with Russia .
But here we must not forget that in view of the many disputes we are currently facing in , for example , the field of trade , we should also improve relations with the United States . Mr Verheugen , I would therefore cordially request you to ensure that the US @-@ EU summit in Bonn on 19 June is also used to strengthen the partnership and cooperation between the USA and Europe , to improve its shape and also to involve the parliaments in the appropriate way .
The single market is prey to tensions and repercussions .
If the Cologne summit can provide an impetus for this then as far as I am concerned it will have been a success .
I would not like to see any misunderstanding arise here .
There are still some wishes that have not been satisfied , nobody disputes that .
Mr President , I agree with Mr Fayot : it is irresponsible to adopt a text for a statute that could not be examined in the committees !
Mr Prodi has not outlined any plans for greater equality between men and women either within the college of Commissioners or in the Directorates @-@ General .
This would disrupt the nature of the institutions .
We have been at the forefront of the work to ensure openness and better management in the Commission and we now come to put our own house - Parliament - in order .
It would have been far better - and have brought real benefits to consumers - if the consumer had the right to negotiate such compensation / repair etc with a representative of the company - where one exists - in his country of residence .
We Greens hope that you will support the amendments to that effect that we tabled to the compromise resolution , so that we can vote for the compromise .
Taking this a step further , Mr President , negotiations took place and then we had the European Council meeting in Berlin , until which time there had been a certain indecisiveness .
So allow me to ask one question : in this context , where does the future of the countryside lie with the development of the Structural Funds to benefit urban areas , with the new WTO negotiations and with a CAP that contradicts our European identity ?
Yet in Berlin it was not provided with anything near the funding that this House and the Commission rightly called for .
But like the Structural Funds as a whole , and Parliament sees this as a key point , ISPA must make a lasting contribution to job creation .
The Commission had also recommended granting livestock farmers partial financial compensation for this new reduction in prices .
And as far as I can see , this agreement would be of less use to us than the strict application of Article 272 of the Treaty .
It means we now have one upper limit for traditional guarantee expenditure and a second upper limit for rural development .
Social promotion is naturally determined in the first instance by meeting the basic needs of our citizens and there is clearly much to do in this area .
The seriousness of this de facto suspension of the agreements on free movement of persons will naturally not escape you , but your prudence in matters of institutional powers - which I can understand - does not mean you can avoid a political response . Can the European Union tolerate three thousand citizens being prevented on alleged police grounds from exercising their full rights as European citizens ?
It is true that a Member State can make use of a safeguard clause .
So we now conclude that in spite of the problem of which we are both aware , the movement towards a civil society in Algeria that began in the 1990s has in fact been boosted by the electoral campaign .
In my answer I did not even list all the initiatives we have already taken .
After its last examination on the basis of the conditions set on 9 November 1998 , the Council decided that Croatia should continue to be granted autonomous trade preferences but that the conditions for assistance under the PHARE programme had not been met and that it was also too soon to negotiate a trade and cooperation agreement .
I am absolutely astonished that Parliament &apos;s Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development rejected an amendment tabled by my group to correct this situation and that the amendment was declared inadmissible in the House pursuant to Rule 60 of the Rules of Procedure .
Mr President , I am speaking basically on the Arias Cañete report .
I hope it will be made clear to everybody at all times that the concessions expected from us in the World Trade Organisation negotiations have been made and that we will not offer the prospect of any more concessions to the farmers of Europe until the present seven years have expired .
I have in mind , for example , the resolution on the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic , which is on the agenda this morning .
We would like to see the new ESF swiftly and smoothly implemented within the next year , without further loss of time and guaranteeing prompt and reliable planning for those responsible for the projects and for the Member States .
I think that we will also benefit from EQUAL .
We will use that power , Mr President - and I warn the Council that we are determined to use that power - to ensure firstly that there is openness and transparency ( and I welcome the progress that has been made in that respect in the Council working group ) , but secondly to ensure that there is equality between Parliament and Council .
Amsterdam does not even require us to deliver an opinion at any point during this procedure .
The Council blocked everything , it was impossible to make any progress and here we have two collective agreements that have been achieved in the meantime .
We have achieved a lot on social policy .
But I am standing up for the rights of a parliament to take a vote on something which must in principle exist as a whole .
I should be willing to sacrifice a few slots on my electioneering schedule to that end .
First , the President @-@ in @-@ Office has himself admitted that there is no agreement on the Schengen information system .
And we must acknowledge that , without doubt , these limits have been transcended , not only by including many of the issues that used to be under the third pillar in the EC Treaty , in other words , in the first pillar , but also by way of the relative progress made with Article 39 .
I know some of the consumer movements disagree with me but the only rational way to trace out responsibility is to do it along this line .
Mr President , International Consumers &apos; Day was celebrated in March , with the theme of electronic commerce and consumer protection .
As a trading place it must be safe , because that is also in the interest of business .
Amendment No 48 belongs to this group ; there was a question on that .
In this interinstitutional agreement and in the financial perspective , however , we are fixing the maximum rate of increase for the next seven years .
Mr Samland is against , I think .
In this case this is due to the need to move this forward rapidly .
It reflected our contempt for a risky and excessively restrictive seven @-@ year financial programme .
Miranda de Lage recommendation ( A4 @-@ 0220 / 99 )
For a start , the national parliaments should all be consulted and all of their proposals together should form the basic document to be discussed by the Member States during the subsequent negotiations .
There is not much choice when you have a pistol pointing at your head .
The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :
Nonetheless , in the guerrilla warfare of recent months , all the bad things taking place in the world are being blamed on the European Commission .
We doubt whether these 41 mayors will be allowed to exercise their democratic rights as elected representatives of the people .
I think it would be more true to say precisely the opposite !
To a certain extent the problem is like that of the chicken and the egg .
I do not think that the Austrians , who are neighbours of the Czechs , should be exposed to the risks of a power station that is even more vulnerable to accidents .
With regard to the more general system of recognition of qualifications , I am also in favour of improving and consolidating the system , because although in theory the level of recognition of qualifications is satisfactory , it is not exercised sufficiently in practice .
I am just a servant of this House .
It is a logical extension because it will protect people &apos;s privacy , but it does not mean that we are protecting a particular technical communication medium .
I was talking about Mr Florio because he was the draftsman of the opinion in the Committee on Legal Affairs .
How can we expect Community nationals to feel any sort of sense of belonging to the European Union if , in their everyday lives or in doing something as natural as looking for work , they are rejected just because they come from one Member State or another ?
There is another European element in the European Union &apos;s exhibition on the theme of &apos; Humankind - Nature - Technology &apos; : the euro .
This budget , which will cover the needs of all EU institutions , is deemed the minimum necessary to finance the proper participation of the Union at the Expo .
I support this cri de coeur from the Europe textile industry .
Our group has supported you faithfully until the end and you know that , wherever we may be , you will always be remembered .
From an emotional standpoint , there is a Spanish folk song that could express the way I feel at the moment . I am not going to sing it but I will recite the lyrics .
I shall immediately grant Mario Soares &apos; request to have the floor .
Election of Quaestors
But it may be that we do not work as rationally as we could or should .
I would also ask that note be taken , on the monitors and the other technical installations , of the fact that our group is now the largest group in the Parliament , something of which many people are already aware .
Reconciliation was able to take place in Western Europe after 1945 and so it can in the Balkans today , provided that it is possible to root out the hatred and violence of nationalism there too .
Even before the German Council Presidency the Environment Minister travelled to London and Paris with the intention of breaking off Treaties .
Immediately after the Berlin Summit the Federal Government itself commented that agricultural policy would need to be reformed again in view of enlargement .
That is also something which should not be forgotten .
During the war in Kosovo , I experienced just how much weight Europe can bring to bear in terms of possibilities for shaping situation by political means , and in terms of possibilities for pursuing a preventative foreign policy , a preventative peace policy , and for resolving a conflict when the conflict has worsened .
The name of the candidate selected is visible and is also emphasised by the asterisk .
Applause
Although it is exacerbated by the confidence crisis produced by the défaillance of the Commission , this Parliament does have a democratic deficit . It is far removed from the everyday problems of the people of Europe .
May I recall with pride the years President Prodi and I worked together in our national government , the difficult challenges we faced and those in which we succeeded , including that most difficult challenge for Italy - the euro .
The third and last thought refers to President Martens &apos; address on behalf of the Group of the European People &apos;s Party in this Parliament during the debate on political agendas .
Mr President , Madam Minister , just as the Minister did in a part of his speech , I am also going to use the second Finnish national language .
We no longer want centralism and unification , but decentralisation and freedom .
That is a line of argument that this Parliament has represented and which we have defended , namely that greater local autonomy should be devolved to the area where the reconstruction work is actually to take place .
You need it and we need it .
Of course , rebuilding Kosovo and intervention in the Western Balkans are matters requiring immediate attention but the question is : have we learned from past mistakes ?
The European Union could subsidise Kosovo for ever and hardly notice it .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m .
I welcome enormously the fact that the new President of the Commission , together with his new Commission , which we still have to approve , wishes to introduce different rules to the game .
There are those who would say , and they have , I believe , rationality on their side , that the provisions of Article 213 of the Treaty and its references to integrity and discretion mean that for anyone who has an understanding of required standards in public life , little more should need to be said , if anything .
Unfortunately , the Commission was only informed of the problem by the Belgian authorities on 27 May , but we immediately implemented a whole range of measures with a view to safeguarding the health of humans and animals .
Mr Fischler , I believe this to be the case and , after your speech here today , which I thought was excellent , I am even more convinced .
I am pleased about this , but still I cannot help but feel that this is still too little .
Or are there really people out there who can make out a good case for recycled products and waste entering our food chain ?
What I would say is that we must learn lessons from this crisis .
This crisis , just like the BSE crisis , is throwing up questions which we must answer , both in concrete terms and also very quickly .
Politically , I belong to the Liberal Group .
This solution strikes us as completely unworkable , for in order to prepare for enlargement , we need institutions which are not more rigid but more flexible , and that is why we feel that this mandate for negotiation must be set right by the Helsinki Council .
The dioxin scandal has clearly demonstrated one thing - if animal feed , as the first link in the food chain , is contaminated , the inspection of foodstuffs comes too late .
I do not believe that any genuine lover of football would think that was either sensible or acceptable .
So these businesses are now going to have to repay the social grants which they were given because of an extremist , narrow @-@ minded and almost plain stupid way of seeing things .
I ask for fair treatment in this case as indeed in many others .
I will not dwell on these , since Parliament is well acquainted with them and I believe they are already assigned to history .
And , my colleague Mr Pöttering , Commissioner Kinnock has already said that certainly as far as whistle @-@ blowers are concerned , there will be new support procedures in this regard , and this House will certainly fully endorse that .
It contained , for example , fundamental criticism of the propensity of the Commission - like other administrations - to , I quote : &quot; deal with its own area according to a logic of its own , listening to a particular type of lobbying , and taking insufficient account of the consequences outside its own field of expertise &quot; .
The goal , which the Wise Men have set , the creation of a European Prosecution Office within a year , is ambitious , yet it is completely feasible if the will is there .
That is when you get cheating and bad supervision and when even the EU &apos; s inspectors and their attempts to carry out inspections are viewed as abusive meddling or as disagreeable acts of hostility .
But I do not wish to dwell on these issues , since I agree that the enormous majority of people who work for Europe are competent and honest .
This is an administrative problem , not a criminal issue .
European Commission officials say that this is already implicit in the text .
The real substance of this report and my concern is as raised by Mrs Jackson , that the Commission may not give its support to these proposals .
With regard to Mr Bolkestein , the conditions which President Prodi himself imposed on his team , as we understand it , oblige him to renounce the Presidency of the Liberal International , because of incompatibility , and not because we want him to renounce his ideas , especially those which he demonstrated during his hearing .
You and the Commissioners have found the words to express it : change , reforms , questioning , new culture , glasnost .
Not everyone shone all the time , but it is easier being the examiner than the examinee .
Bad practice is allowed without sanction , dysfunction in the system is allowed to continue .
The statement by President @-@ designate Prodi seems to express this intention . We invite him to pursue this avenue , thereby taking the path to reducing bureaucracy .
However , we need the alliance you propose for the vision of a European democracy .
It is the peripheral regions with a degree of development which is lower , much lower , than the Community average which suffer most from unemployment and which have the least effective infrastructures .
Mr Posselt , we will make sure that what you said yesterday has been correctly included in the Minutes , because that is really the only issue here , and not whether there should be a new debate on the matter .
Should all go well tomorrow , we look forward to working with her on these and other matters .
When you obtain these things , you also acquire , however , a responsibility to make sure that each and every one of the Commissioners can live up to the ideals , share the focus and conviction and meet the requirements of justice and propriety that we all demand now .
While Parliament must look at its own role very seriously , especially following the poor turnout in the recent elections in many Member States - evidence at best of disinterest but more likely cynicism and disdain by our citizens - our job today is to respond to the hearing of the Commissioners @-@ elect and to the case put by the President @-@ elect , Mr Prodi .
Specifically , I should like to touch upon three points relating to budgetary supervision .
In my opinion , dismantling monopolies is to the advantage of the citizens of the European Union .
The Committee of Independent Experts says that OLAF must be given the necessary resources to put an end to this aura of corruption which brought about the downfall of the former Commission .
With reference to other matters raised , such as food safety or air @-@ traffic control , I would remind you of what I said in my earlier speeches to Parliament .
In accordance with the above @-@ mentioned principles , agreement has been reached on a number of important decisions of the expenditure category , which I will briefly introduce now .
That is one thing we cannot do .
The development of staffing policy must be regarded as an important part of EU policy .
It is my intention today to inform you of the agenda and preparatory work relating to the European Council meeting in Tampere .
I think Member States should adopt a constructive stance in recognising decisions and judgements made by the authorities in other Member States .
Safeguarding the free movement of our citizens and the flexible creation of legislation on the subject will require the adoption of the practice of majority ruling in Union legislation .
However , the European Parliament runs the risk of putting itself beyond the discussion by straining to achieve its own utopia in which the citizens are enabled , by virtue of the advantages of European citizenship thrust upon them , to at last see the light at the end of the tunnel .
For this reason we must be mindful of the fact that many Member States have difficulties with this .
And now a personal view on the fight against crime and the challenge posed by immigration .
It is an important sign that this is precisely how so many national governments have come to see it recently .
The creation of a European judicial area and establishing a working party to discuss the idea has my full support .
Our Group does have a group position .
Mr Prodi has therefore passed up the opportunity to usher in a new start for the Commission , which is needed .
The fact remains that , in his speech to the European Parliament , Romano Prodi made statements which can only disappoint and worry those who are waiting for rapid and bold responses from the European Union in order to re @-@ align Europe to be at the service of people and humanity rather than of finance and of the great God , money , for Europe to put itself forward as an alternative to world @-@ wide liberalisation .
I warn you of this , Mr President , in consideration of the 2000 budget .
What we want is to see that this money is actually spent , and to see the Commission do its best , put its shoulder to the wheel , create the posts and ensure that the money is indeed spent on those things that the budgetary authority intended it to be spent on .
In spite of the fact that President Habibie himself has admitted that Indonesia was not capable of maintaining order , and that he invited a United Nations peacekeeping team to go into Timor , for various reasons after this , the arrival of this team has been delayed .
The next obvious step is to prosecute those responsible for the crimes recently committed in East Timor , indeed President Habibie &apos; s pledges support this .
The top military man in the United States aiding and abetting the violence in East Timor and last Monday ordering his Indonesian pal to accept an international peace force .
I think that this time , Timor will not be forgotten again and I think that the ever growing support for the long @-@ suffering and heroic people of Timor will remain strong until they are free and until Timor is a happy nation - one that is moving forwards .
We believe that attention should also be given to what is happening there .
Why was the UN Council taken by surprise ?
For this reason , we eagerly await the Tampere Summit . We require an initiative and a commitment which affects all of us , even the most reluctant of governments , which is , unfortunately , the case with the Spanish government in this field .
Precisely with what means , it is very difficult indeed to predict .
Question No 6 by ( H @-@ 0416 / 99 ) :
In a general sense , this means it should be guaranteed that all kinds of capital transfers may take place freely in connection with accession .
The violence and persecution that continue in Kosovo is only to be condemned .
It is also responsible for re @-@ establishing constitutional relationships .
Mr President , we welcome with great interest and some concern the draft which has been submitted to us , and of course we approve of the general positions stated by our rapporteur , Mrs Pack .
The Commission &apos; s local representative had to ask about everything in Brussels because the people in Brussels were so dreadfully afraid of mistakes being made .
Hence our proposal that we should not set up another of the famous management committees but , rather , that we should work together with an advisory committee .
We must be more careful .
So there is no response from the Council . The Council appears not to have been invited to come here and tell us what it is going to do .
We must offer them prospects for the future .
Per annum , this will mean in practical terms a reduction in the overall annual budget for road safety campaigns from EUR 9.9 million to EUR 8 million .
Similar difficulties exist for parliamentary control which means that action by the police and secret services and public security standards will remain all the more uncontrolled .
The Northern Dimension , medical care , the Nordic regions , etc , will all be important . Now Russia needs from us very concrete proposals on co @-@ operation , and that is why I regard the aspect of the Northern Dimension as so important , and I hope the Commission will act .
I hope for worthwhile and constructive dialogue with him over the next few years .
I believe , Mr President , that if we were to do anything useful and long @-@ standing - and I would like the opinion of the Commissioner on this - then that would have to be the setting up of that wonderful organisation we have been talking about - the one for the study of earthquakes , etc - which , in turn , would have to have a main code of ethics as regards its constitution and when , where , how and to whom information on earthquakes should be publicised .
Perhaps we should have organised things a little better here in this Parliament and had an extensive debate on Russia and all the things going on there , in view of its needs and the great importance of the country , also from the European Union &apos; s point of view , in an attempt to get some kind of grip on the situation .
It is true that there is an agreement , on the basis of which the conflict was brought to an end , but it would appear that when this agreement was concluded , the group of people in captivity was forgotten about .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are now hostages coming between Iran and the European Union .
The efforts of the conservatives to regain the initiative and undermine the government must realistically be regarded as a preface to the parliamentary elections which are due to take place next February .
Your statement was not included in the Minutes , but I am pleased to take note of it .
But we would ask that when there is space our assistants should be allowed access : it is not always convenient for them to be in our offices if we have visitors .

For example , we have the greatest parliamentary chamber in the world at the moment , the best from a functional point of view .
Before making a few observations , I would like to draw your attention to the matter of tastes and colours .
Please look into this once more .
The room lacks character ( layout and design should be improved ) .
Mrs Roth @-@ Behrendt did not keep to the subject .
What ought this White Paper to contain ?
For us it means getting back to the quality of foodstuffs which guarantees the safety of products intended for consumption .
Is it not the case that efforts should be made to monitor this in other EU countries as well , and a number of other things too ?
I endorse the comments made by Mr Whitehead .
What matters is that we have supervision over the process as a whole .
We need urgently to know what steps the Commission is taking against the French .
We must be in agreement about this .
The Commission &apos; s determined effort to restore consumer confidence by putting effective control mechanisms in place is clearly welcome .
There are drugs for this and they must be made available .
The Commission favours prevention , which is indispensable , but it underestimates the possible inconsistency of access to treatment .
It is , of course , ironic , as we mentioned in the Development Committee yesterday , that the Budget Committee voted last week to cut the budget line on reproductive health care and HIV / AIDS work by half from EUR 25 million to 12 million , and that we are now discussing the need for investment in this area .
Mr Wijkman mentioned relations with other organisations , and the WHO was mentioned by another speaker .
The truth is that not a single euro benefits the people in the region , neither small and medium @-@ sized businesses nor the education and health systems . Nor is the money used to create employment .
That is approximately double the present figure .
We are asking Member States to pledge their commitment to the encouragement of renewable energy - and they all say , individually , that they have this commitment - by signing a Charter on renewable energy - the EURENEW Charter .
And it is clearly through the possibility of providing access to the network , through being flexible enough in the proposals that we put forward , which allow us to cover the different instruments which the different Member States have used and which are not homogenous and are different , that we will be able to guarantee that renewable energy is not only maintained but doubled in the coming years .
It is very good to start the work of this new Parliament with programmes which can make a difference , both to the environment and , of course , to the competitiveness needs of our Member States .
South Africa will open its markets to 86 % of European Union exports over twelve years .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Kinnock for her report .
Mr President , the first thing I want to say is how much I welcome what I hope will be the successful conclusion of this landmark agreement , and I congratulate the rapporteur for her tireless work to get the best possible outcome .
For South Africa the bold move towards a trade , development and cooperation agreement with the EU is a symbol of its commitment to economic restructuring and to regaining its full place in the international community .
The basic philosophy , however , seems to be this : there are some subjects which upset or violate competition and so we must have thorough harmonisation . However , I think that harmonisation would be harmful for other items , which is not the case in the current States where we even find diversity from region to region .
Moving beyond compensation now , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Alavanos has asked a question which has always interested me - I am now thinking of the action that I took in my own country when I was Minister for the Environment , concerned with natural risks - the matter of prevention .
The result is , of course , that we still do not have a satisfactory situation with regard to a self @-@ supporting sector of the economy , capable of development , above all in the middle range .
Subject : Availability of the Official Journal Members of the public are not particularly well aware of their rights and should be entitled to receive information about legislation , since it is they who finance it .
For general information , print is still predominant as Eurobarometer shows that access to the Internet is not yet general in most Member States , especially not for the public at large .
This applies , in particular , to the some 5 000 current projects with NGOs , financed either from the budget or via our delegations from the EDF .
We will then see what amounts can be paid out definitively .
Credibility is urgently needed in order to convince the Turkish side that they have to make an active contribution to the implementation of this strategy .
In other words , at the present time , we need a policy which assists Turkey whilst maintaining a critical attitude and a policy which induces it to settle obvious issues such as the Kurdish question , the Cyprus issue or the human rights problems speedily and humanely .
I can assure you that Mr Papandreou made no such statement .
Could we cite the changes that are afoot as regards religious freedoms ?
None of the applicant countries meet the Copenhagen criteria yet , otherwise by definition they would be members now , so what is the difference with Turkey ?
I value the motion for a resolution proposed here very highly , and I would like to say that I am particularly satisfied that Parliament is promising to act swiftly in matters relating to the Turkish question .
Indications of that are EU cooperation with the Mediterranean countries within the framework of the Barcelona Process and moves to continue the MENA series of Summits next spring .
Mr President , this resolution does not evoke the same feelings .
And , finally , the lack of solutions for the Palestinian refugees living outside their country , who have the right to return to their home .
Draft Decision of the EEA Joint Committee amending Annex I ( Veterinary and Phytosanitary Matters ) to the EEA Agreement - Draft common position of the Community ( SEC ( 1999 ) 1037 - C5 @-@ 0101 / 99 - 1999 / 0813 ( CNS ) ) ( Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy )
I would only ask , Madam President , that we may have a separate vote on paragraph 7 , because I have an oral amendment on it .
While I welcome the recent undertaking by Monsanto not to commercialise the &apos; seed termination technology &apos; , this matter is far too serious to leave to those who are directly involved and who would have acted otherwise in the absence of consumer vigilance .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the process of enlargement of the European Union is the important theme of this legislature .
The EU is also united in its call for a round to last approximately three years .
We also agree with the Commission and the Council , in that this round of negotiations must be comprehensive , that is , one that includes all subjects .
I think that this protectionism which is felt in Europe - in France and Italy - is completely out of place and obsolete .
This is because in France the sickle has revolted against MacDonalds and the Millennium has come out of hiding .
Mr President , Commissioner , in the short time I have left , I would just like to make a few key points .
This is one choice , but it is not ours and we do not want a situation where tomorrow , in Europe , the inclusion of services in the scope of the WTO leads to the rules of competition and market openness being applied to sectors such as health and education .
The role of Parliament has also been discussed here .
We need to produce an action programme to enable the European Union to live up to what it signed up to in Kyoto .
I agree with her statement , including the parts of it concerning measures to arrest climate change .
In relation to the energy tax issue , it is time we decided exactly what we mean by this .
It is the responsibility of the authorities and bodies appointed by the Member States and the Commission .
Work in the area of crisis management is in total harmony with the neutrality or non @-@ alignment policy of Member States .
I would like to ask the Council , and the Commission , how it feels , in general terms , that this campaign is developing ; if it is true that this has been a good year for tuna and that this is why disputes between the different fleets that work the Bay of Biscay have been avoided . I would like to know by how many boats each country has reduced its fleets as a result of the moratorium and if this method is proving useful in reducing the pressure on tuna populations .
I should like to thank the Minister for his answer .
The war is political , it is taking place at the same time as election campaigns in Russia , so that any way out must also be political .
Moratorium on the death penalty - B5 @-@ 0144 / 1999 by Mr Thors and others , on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the vote on the UN General Assembly resolution on the creation of a universal moratorium on capital punishment ;
The area is becoming more and more unsettled .
It is certainly a name with holy connotations and you are from Sweden .
The success of the Austrian Freedom Party last week threatens to contribute to making dangerously populist and xenophobic views respectable in Europe .
We are asking the Member States - because they say aircraft from one of the Member States or NATO might have been involved in that act of war - to help with information , which there is no longer any reason to keep confidential , concealed or secret , so that we really can bring the facts to light and the whole truth can be told .
This is not only injuring people but also adding insult to injury .
The questions relating to inspection of the fuel at the Sellafield MOX plant are within the competence of the national authorities and have been reported to the UK nuclear installations inspectorate .
On the other hand , you are maintaining your request for the submission of motions for resolutions at the end of the debate .
( DE ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I am able to follow on from where the preceding speaker left off .
And because , Madam President , Parliament must clearly abide by the same rules , I too am voting for the agreement .
Our task consists mainly of painstakingly dismantling the divergent national regulations which have evolved , and of bringing them into line with one another .
The point that he made very clearly is one which I believe to be very important - that this piece of legislation is one of a larger series of pieces of legislation which are going to regulate electronic commerce .
In this context , the Treaty does not leave room for interpretation .
It seems to me that this directive is too important for that .
Are there any comments ?
We are respecting all the ceilings in all the categories and we are even leaving substantial margins in some of them , such as Category 1B on rural development .
On the other hand , the increasing tasks of the Union in external action will also need to be reflected in the structure of the budget .
That is clear and , given that the greater part of the budget falls within the agricultural sector , it was only to be expected .
I believe that Parliament is fairly unanimous on this point .
Within the interinstitutional agreement , we have established that , in future , agricultural policy too can be definitively co @-@ decided by us .
The reason put forward to attempt to justify these swinging cuts is the unexpected appearance of new priorities , which are incidentally perfectly legitimate , such as aid for the reconstruction of Kosovo , our contribution to the construction of East Timor now that it has been liberated , our solidarity with the earthquake victims in Turkey and financing of a fisheries agreement with Morocco .
We must make sure not only that funds are properly spent but that the ideas which are coming through are properly coordinated .
However , Parliament has also clearly shown in today &apos; s debate that it is increasingly aware of its responsibility , not just insofar as concerns the effective use of funds , but also the discharging of funds .
It is normal - and this is the view of the rapporteur and my own group - that , at the beginning of the budgetary process , we should be concerned to see that in the first reading no commitment had been specified for these EUR 125 million .
This budget reflects the fundamental orientation of the European institutions , responsible for facilitating the activities of the large capitalist groups , including in the areas which are most damaging to society , such as the redundancy plans which are responsible for the gravity of the unemployment situation and the spread of poverty .
In spite of the huge budgetary constrictions within which we work , the Commission managed to find the means to respond to the most pressing needs even in 1999 .
I must say that I am disappointed that the Council is not here because I would like to know if they will support this .
The Commission agrees that it is of course , necessary for the budget appropriations for the year 2000 to correspond to actual requirements as far as possible , and that no artificial reductions should be made here .
Third , lasting price stability serves the interests of social justice and helps to protect the weakest members of our society , such as pensioners and the unemployed , who depend on fixed incomes and who cannot protect themselves against the costs of inflation with other assets , such as property or shares .
These three successes are the prerequisite for economic growth , on the one hand , essential investment in the future , on the other hand , and creating jobs and making them secure .
Certainly , this first report by the European Central Bank is compensating for the launch of the euro and you and the Governing Council of the bank are taking on a great responsibility .
Mr President , the European Central Bank is still very much an institution which makes crucial decisions for the millions of citizens of the European Union without being subject to any democratic or political control .
Finally , I also want to associate myself with Mr Huhne &apos; s understanding of the goal and significance of monetary policy . I want to go a step further and say that the ideology concerning stability is just that : an ideology .
It recently became apparent that the Central Bank will not oppose frontloading the general public with coins .
Our task is to promote financial stability and the stability of the financial markets .
First of all , he promises openness and modernity ; openness is incredibly important , since ECHO is among the highest @-@ profile organisations of the European Union .
What is most important is to have an influence on the reasons behind emigration through contact with the countries concerned .
This objective was achieved .
The compulsory aspect of this charter is essential with a view to the construction of a Citizens &apos; Europe .
The second point I would like to touch on is the involvement of citizens .
Despite its positive features , therefore , the outcome must be seen , from the point of view of fundamental and human rights , as the victory of a defensive battle .
I regret that Tampere does not address the issues with sufficient firmness .
It is true that there will be greater cooperation and that there were some areas in which it was easy to reach agreement , such as in the case of creating EUROJUST which should become operational towards the end of 2001 , or in the strengthening of EUROPOL &apos; s role or even in the creation of a European Police Academy .
I hand the floor to Mr Vitorino .
This IGC , though , will not be so much about broadening the field of responsibility or the competences of the European Union ; it will be about structural reform , institutional reform , reform that will make the Union more open , more efficient , more democratic and more transparent .
On the question of foreign and security policy , the report wastes a lot of time on developing security policy , as well as policies for governments and heads of state , and forgets in the process that security policy is a function of foreign policy .
( Applause )
This means that regulations to control this new market must be adopted as quickly as possible .
Obviously , the more rights you give legal immigrants , the more immigrants you are going to attract , including illegal immigrants hoping that their situation will one day be regularised .
But this particular debate is in fact bringing out something that is fairly essential in all debates on social and employment affairs , namely restructuring and globalisation
Mr President , the arrogant and rabble @-@ rousing European political class has found the ideal scapegoat to carry the blame for its own base economic behaviour .
It is up to us to manage it in such a way that its negative aspects can be avoided .
You just have to adapt now ; no @-@ one can avoid the growing concentrations of businesses .
The disappointment felt as a result of the decision was expressed , while it was still fresh in everybody &apos; s mind , in the statement presented by the country to hold the presidency of the European Union on 13 October .
We have to point out to our American friends and partners the risk involved in this decision , because it encourages States such as Pakistan and India - with the risk of all @-@ out war - to continue with their nuclear tests .
Very often , differences between warring neighbouring countries or even upsetting a geopolitical equilibrium which one state feels is not in its interest is reason enough for some to resort to the nuclear option .
At the summit , Prime Minister Putin was very positive about the northern dimension .
But Russia in turn needs us , that is to say it needs the European Union .
We were talking strongly because we were reflecting the opinions of our public in the European Union : the sort of opinions reflected in speech after speech in this Chamber today .
I therefore think that it would be particularly misguided of this Parliament not to follow the rapporteur &apos; s recommendations , for you cannot keep saying that you think it is a shame that an ever @-@ decreasing number of people vote in European elections , or that you regret that every inquiry shows that the EU appears to be ever more distant from the people of Europe , only to go making cutbacks in projects whose precise intention it is to bring the EU closer to the people .
Our Committee has worked very quickly and efficiently and , on 28 October 1998 , it unanimously adopted the de Coene report with 61 amendments .
Yet this programme is about investing in our future , investing in young people who will become , as we have heard today , the Europeans of tomorrow .
That is why I tabled , and supported , Amendment No 3 that was put forward by the Committee on Culture , restricting our commitment to three years .
I would ask for this measure to be adopted unanimously , as it was in the Committee , and despite the delay in the 1999 programmes , for it to be implemented on time in 2000 , which is now very near .
I would merely like to clarify one point .
The necessary corrections will have to be made so that they reflect the voting of the Committee on Budgets .
Mr President , I wanted to say that , unlike Mr Bourlanges , I voted against this resolution and did not abstain .
I do not understand why the chairmen of certain groups refer to the agreements in other connections , but in some cases these agreements do not mean anything .
Thus the old European rule is still being applied here : every base act is permitted as long as it contributes to the construction of a federal Europe .
The institutional agreement explicitly mentions the members of institutions , true , but if you take this expression in context you see that it is more a matter of paid members , such as the members of the Commission , and that the terms established are not appropriate for elected members like those of the European Parliament .
The reason for the postponement is that , due to delays in the standardisation work being carried out by the European Committee for Standardisation , the 1999 version of the RID does not incorporate standards for the construction and use of tanks and receptacles for transporting Class 2 gases .
The debate is closed .
One of the most deplorable aspects of this resolution is the failure to address the issue of the Western Sahara .
But the Moroccans bring up , quite rightly , the risk of over @-@ exploitation of fishing resources .
Mr President , Commissioner , firstly let us address the situation in hand .
Neither is it good for the negotiation climate that , through an absurd desire for the limelight , spectacles should be made such as the one this morning with the resolution which various political groups have presented .
It is a matter which I think can be seen from two points of view .
Then , the only eligible products are : deboned meat and a limited range of derived products , from animals between 6 and 30 months of age and born after the effective feed ban , that is born after 1 August 1996 .
But all this argument illustrates the need for an independent food standard agency at EU level .
While the UK has obeyed EU law to the letter , other countries are running a cart and horse through the rule book .
Just think , ladies and gentlemen : we should and must defend the European agricultural model at the WTO talks in Seattle .
It was very much in the spirit of the entente cordiale .
This Protocol laid down the technical and financial conditions whereby Community ships are permitted to fish in Angolan waters in the period from 3 May 1999 to 2 May 2000 .
I would simply like to express , on your behalf , and on behalf of the European Parliament , my sincere condolences to the victims &apos; families .
&quot; the SSC considers that the measures taken by the UK make any risk to human health from the UK DBES at least comparable to that in other European Member States &quot; .
The control systems that are in place - the inspections and controls - are undertaken by the Food and Veterinary Office in respect of the DBES scheme .
You may have noted I did so earlier and I have done so on a number of occasions .
Why has a decision not been taken immediately ?
The two levels of dialogue - technical and political - complement each other successfully .
Our own research also shows that economic development in the conventional sense is becoming limited in some areas due to lack of fresh water and that the European Union already produces more toxic waste than it can deal with as a by @-@ product of economic growth .
For the sake of employment and welfare throughout Europe , I am therefore looking for a clearer and sharper perspective upon EMU from the Commission and Commissioner Solbes Mira , as well as from the Council .
I want to talk about the outputs from the dialogue .
the recommendation for second reading ( A5 @-@ 0042 / 1999 ) , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council Directive concerning the enforcement of seafarers &apos; hours of work on board ships using Community ports ( 8639 / 2 / 1999 - C5 @-@ 0035 / 1999 - 1998 / 0321 ( COD ) ) ( rapporteur : Mr S. Hughes ) ;
Here again , I would say that I hope the Council adopts this .
Workers in this sector have experienced a veritable regression ; they have gone back in time . Today , they earn less and work more , victims of a liberal capitalism which makes them real victims in this sector .
We must therefore set limits upon what the general public can be expected to accept in this regard .
In relation to Amendment No 5 I fully support it .
Mr President , allow me to make one more brief comment , as this will shorten this evening &apos; s proceedings : my committee also believes that the report on the scientific and technical agreement with Argentina should also be viewed in a positive light .
The debate is closed .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to consider and ask you to consider with me whether we should formally postpone this vote tomorrow to allow us to present our opinions tomorrow .
Information on fuel economy in new cars
In order words , customers will inform themselves out of pure self @-@ interest .
Admittedly , the deadlines are short .
Naturally , in our group , we want to see that the achievement of the internal market involves a balance - as you said yourself , Commissioner - between market freedom and the need to protect the environment , consumer health and consumer confidence .
The second point that we must consider is encouraging the development of these new businesses , to encourage new entrepreneurs , to make sure that the traditional ideas of the European social model that Mr Medina referred to earlier do not in fact inhibit the development of making Europe the place that is going to have the sort of energy and excitement that we see currently in the United States in adopting these new technologies .
So could you make sure they ring it longer and louder in future ?
My opinion is entirely in line with the Amsterdam Treaty which attaches much more importance to equality than did the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Rome .
Broad consultations and public debate must be undertaken in order to decide upon major public works : public transport networks , energy saving programmes , renovation and construction of housing , projects which create a great number of jobs and which benefit everyone &apos; s quality of life .
Inflation is now low , levels of interest are low and budget deficits are either low or have disappeared altogether .
However , we do not accept one key conclusion about the single currency , where it is stated to be fact that the implementation of economic and monetary union creates a good climate for new jobs .
Benchmarking has been mentioned .
Nevertheless , the conclusions have some limits .
Madam President , in principle I would agree , because what Russia is doing to the Chechen people is disgraceful , but I do not think Parliament is being very consistent , because , a few minutes ago , it adopted an agreement with China , when China has been oppressing the Tibetan people since 1959 .
1 ) the combined forces of Member States and the European Union should converge towards a 65 % rate of employment within the next five years ;
Madam President , I believe that this issue is self @-@ explanatory in the sense that we already debated in the previous part @-@ session the importance of Parliament adopting the development and implementing regulations of an interinstitutional agreement , which was agreed during the last legislature and ratified by Parliament .
If we really want to achieve that , then it is specifically the NOx emissions from lorries and buses that we will also have to reduce .
If the decision @-@ making process occurs much later than necessary , then it is impossible for the car industry to accommodate this adequately .
In conclusion , the Commission can accept the following amendments : the first part of Amendment No 3 , Amendments Nos 6 , 7 and 10 , Amendments Nos 16 to 26 and Amendments Nos 29 to 47 .
It has already been mentioned in other interventions that , a few years ago , the European Parliament promoted pilot projects supporting non @-@ governmental organisations and local authorities that , for some time , have been endeavouring to use actions to fight violence against women and children . This phenomenon of violence against women and children is , unfortunately , not only very widespread but is increasing , and is gradually taking on new , even more sophisticated forms , which are therefore more difficult to combat .
Single market considerations often override children &apos; s best interests .
Invariably , greater numbers of children than adults are killed due to a lack of experience and training .
One of Parliament &apos; s proposals is that existing national workers &apos; organisations must be involved in drawing up this agreement .
They were , however , directly related to the completion of the internal market .
Secondly , securing and consolidating our financial power to act also means acquiring new forms of revenue that we can truly call our own and that will replace the previous ones .
It leads to transitional periods which are far too long for the other candidate countries in terms of the environment , for fear that otherwise this , and I quote from the government document , &quot; would lead to an increase in financial strain &quot; .
Thus , the most badly paid employees and even the unemployed or the homeless , when paying VAT on their food , are contributing towards financing the European institutions which , nonetheless , have not undertaken a single measure in their favour .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m .
I am very grateful to the Committee on Budgets for giving its unequivocal support to the Committee on Budgetary Control in this matter and that we now have these 30 posts for 1999 .
Nevertheless , we will always be faced with situations in which one or other development debars full exploitation of the lines .
The introduction of an eco @-@ tax may lead to more energy efficiency and , as such , lower energy consumption .
I thus thought I would speak about gas , and a little about Russia .
A carbon dioxide tax involving a simultaneous reduction in the tax on work would be an excellent step in the right direction .
This is why the Council &apos; s common position on this , envisaging a nine @-@ year transitional period , would be unacceptable !
This was made possible by means of the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty on 1 May this year , which as part of heading IV in Articles 61 and 65 makes judicial cooperation in civil cases a firm part of the EC Treaty .
The regulation submitted for our opinion today is therefore particularly welcome in so far as it includes unquestionable advantages in relation to the so @-@ called Brussels II Convention , signed in 1998 , but not as yet ratified .
I would also like to thank you for your earlier comments that nuclear power stations must be treated politically and economically , that we cannot expect them to be taken out of operation overnight and that we need an exit plan and time to implement it .
The problem is simply that when I entered office , as you know , I found a completed agreement with Slovakia ; completed and sealed .
Quite clearly , a controversy between these two agencies such as we have had over the last few weeks cannot be tolerated if we hope to have a unified harmonised market .
In relation to the BSE issue , once again it seems to me that the application of the precautionary principle is inappropriate because we have a firm opinion from the Scientific Steering Committee .
I fear that this may be a piece of parliamentary manoeuvring , but we are going to run that risk .
I thank you , Commissioner , for your response .
As far as the other seven , including Italy , are concerned , we still have to check , on the basis of the proposals received by my department , country by country , that the proposed zoning plan in fact meets all the criteria of the Regulations of the Structural Funds .
It is a matter of encouraging the development of cooperation between countries , under the auspices of the new Community initiative INTERREG @-@ III for the period 2000 @-@ 2006 , which will continue to finance cross @-@ border cooperation within the European Union and with third countries .
To achieve political and economic stability , enhance social welfare for the citizens of the applicant countries and prevent the risk of social dumping in the present Member States , the applicant countries will need to modernise their social security systems if enlargement is to be successful .
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
It will surely be necessary to reassess certain priorities , the common provision of resources and the multinational distribution of tasks .
Plainly , the Commission is not a college of amateur chiefs of staff and plainly , we want to work successfully with the High Representative and with Parliament to ensure that Europe has the security and defence policy that it needs and that its citizens want .
Thirdly , we want to lay down the condition that each operation must be independent from the others , and decisions on it must be able to be taken separately .
I am therefore grateful to Mr Patten who has emphatically drawn attention to this very issue .
It is in our common interest that they succeed as this will also be our success and in this we must support them .
So , I welcome what has been said today , but I do have some questions and , unusually for these sorts of debates , I would actually like some answers .
Market participants must have the easiest possible access to all markets in the world .
Our cultural industries have nevertheless been seen , as I said last month , as an addendum to many of the serious trade issues that are going to be discussed at Seattle .
Even in the rich countries , in particular the United States , which have profited most from open markets , the increasing number of international competitors within the framework of the World Trade Organisation has lead , ironically I might add , to growing scepticism and concern that globalisation is also bringing with it impoverishment , destruction of the environment and the loss of national sovereignty .
I support the call to apply the precautionary principle and sustainability in all sectors .
This is why I can do no more than urge you to vote in favour of this report , unanimously , to avoid further procedural delays ( conciliation ) , and to enable it to come into force in January 2000 .
This margin could be used for accession in due course .
The priority for us is to check that the proceeds of the scheme are properly used to repay pension arrears and for other social projects .
And if we say that we do not wish to exclude Russia from Europe , that is true .
The whole thing is a shambles , blind hypocrisy .
You must also know , then , that we are counting specifically on you to ensure that the WTO negotiations result in the outcome that we expect .
How can it be made to happen ?
The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party will be voting against the Schwaiger report because it sides with monopoly capital in its attack on workers and the people of the world .
Let us beware , therefore , of regarding the WTO as a panacea for our problems .
From an economic point of view , there are major disadvantages attached to the current practice , as this can lead to a handful of companies being in unacceptable positions of power .
If we do not advance further along the route towards multilateral liberalisation , that means leaving the way open for unilateral action by the strongest .
I want to mention five points in connection with which demands are being made in my part of our report .
Now we have moved on to the political level , and we are having bilateral discussions at different levels with the other Member States , the European Parliament and the Commission .
I commend the Liberal proposals to Parliament .
One amendment seeks to re @-@ establish in the report a request that the IGC should re @-@ examine the issue of flexible cooperation .
You are already aware of the Commission &apos; s contribution to the preparation for this Conference .
This is the issue of the reform of the Council , of the whole package of reforms which , we have been told , must and can take place in addition to a reform of the Treaties .
I think that the most important thing here is that we consider how the European Union might be provided with a constitution .
On account of various protests and environmental considerations , the road @-@ works were halted , and the national authorities and the Commission began discussions and to reconsider the strategies in terms of modes , the idea being to treat the rail link as a future key trans @-@ European network .
The public in the EU has a direct interest in preventing the spread of drugs .
I am very disappointed by what the Council has done .
This does not just refer to vessels which are actually from Cyprus or Greece , which would have roused particular interest , but it also refers to European Union vessels .
This is a purely political debate .
We assume that the urgent procedure can be dealt with in accordance with the rules .
Internal OLAF investigations
In this Dublin Convention , that was concluded in 1990 , the responsibility is established of a Member State &apos; s competence to deal with an asylum procedure - according to this agreement , the State responsible is the one in which a refugee first finds safe haven .
This discrimination also promotes criminalisation .
That is a tragedy .
It is a far more complex , far more widespread problem .
I feel we must be logical and consistent in our approach .
It is not a translation problem .
This is the case of many national audit authorities , not only in France , but in other Member States .
We must resist the onward rush towards treating everything in society as saleable commodities .
- ( FR ) We consider that the European institutions are infinitely more concerned with representing the interests of capital than those of the people in general and the working classes in particular .
In order to achieve an asylum policy of this kind , other measures and far @-@ reaching efforts are required to further agreement between the Member States on the need for a generous and humane asylum policy .
We only have to think about it .
Mr President , the situation in East Timor may have taken a turn for the better thanks to the change of power in Indonesia and thanks to the arrival of the peacekeeping force , but for the ordinary citizen in East Timor and also for the refugees still in West Timor , the situation is still very alarming indeed .
In one after another of the applicant States , it is either in the process of being , or already has been , abolished , which is a very positive development .
Mr President , what has happened in recent years in Kosovo is a profound tragedy .
The government must of course have contact with the population .
I am aware that Mr Nikitin &apos;s lawyers have lodged an application to the European Court of Human Rights and I am certain the Council of Europe &apos;s institutions will pursue this application accordingly .
As far as Burundi is concerned , we , too , are extremely concerned at the situation of increasing violence in this country .
The aims of the Convention account for the unprecedented international reaction : measures to be implemented in international law to protect the rights of the most innocent , most vulnerable of the world &apos;s citizens .
Firstly , the followers of the Swedish model which , apart from treating drug addicts , emphasises the control of narcotics .
You do not want to examine the possibility of changing the prohibitionist policy on drugs , because , when it comes to political choices , you impose moral convictions and beliefs which are a matter for each individual &apos; s conscience .
They are a vice that weakens the will , which ensnares the individual in a dependency which enslaves and depersonalises him or her , which destroys social bonds and relationships , which creates delinquency and makes society less safe , and which sustains world @-@ wide criminal networks that defy States &apos; power and law .
The Committee on Citizens &apos; Freedoms invited the Finnish Presidency and the German Government to come and answer our questions about the proposal .
It is precisely for this reason that we are saying that what this measure is doing is positive - even if it reminds us of Arsène Lupin , the gentleman thief - but it would be much better to have a European electronic identity card which is the same in all the States .
In practice , changing the rate may not have an effect except as a means of regulating the overall amount of loans , as the guarantees do not often have to be paid .
Thank you , Mr Seppänen , for your presentation and your report .
It endeavours to help people fight their addiction , again rightly so .
The said tax , which protected local industry in relation to imported goods , would be gradually dismantled between 1995 and the end of 2000 .
My third question is to do with Korea .
A far better alternative would be a well @-@ thought out industrial policy for the shipbuilding industry aimed at innovative production methods , which are intensive in terms of the knowledge involved and which enhance efficiency .
And we ask for these measures - and I insist - urgently , since many of our shipyards run the serious risk of disappearing , despite being technically and economically viable .
I left Northern Ireland because there was no future , no jobs , no opportunities for young people , but I am delighted that today the future generations will have those opportunities , and Europe has played a critical role in that process .
Madam President , this is a point of order on the agenda .
Given the equal representation of the worlds of sport and government in the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency and given all those who will sit on the board of this agency - all the federations and all the National Olympic Committees - who have all undertaken to implement , in their own area , the decisions taken by the agency , there is real hope .
I believe there is a growing agreement among us on the question of which reforms are needed .
The third issue is Turkey .
I would also like to point out how important it is for the presidency to inject new life into this forum with a new European conference and to involve these future EU members equally in the new configuration of the European Union .
My second comment concerns the position of Turkey .
Indeed it barely rated a mention in your speech , but I hope that the Council is going to spend some time on this vital topic .
Currently , opinions appear to differ .
One way of achieving greater balance in the future might be to take a more thematically structured approach focusing , for example , on particularly vulnerable groups , such as women and children , or specific questions , such as the monitoring of elections .
It does not seem right that we cannot have a proper debate when such an important document is presented . All we are going to get now is a continuous monologue without any response from the other party .
Thank you .
Mr President , as far as the content of the two reports is concerned , I would find it relatively easy to support them , despite certain shortcomings .
Leila Zana , winner of the Sakharov prize , is still in prison , as are three Kurdish parliamentarians and famous writers and journalists .
Without wishing to betray confidentiality , I can go so far as to say here that my impression is that , while the proceedings in Strasbourg are under way , the Turkish Government does not want , under any circumstances , to take a decision on the execution ; their strategy is rather to use the time gained by the proceedings in Strasbourg to abolish capital punishment in Turkey .
It is hoped that these objectives , as well as the first daughter directive for air quality , can be achieved .
Directive 96 / 62 allows the use of random measurement if it can be shown to be sufficiently accurate .
In view of the fact that the Commission is already in the process of investigating the possibility of a frame of reference , the proposed justification ought to reflect this situation in a correct manner .
Why did I say this ?
Consulting the European Parliament is therefore a procedure which cannot have any real effect .
External quality is one of the factors which determines the quality of the woodland of the future .
The Council has worsened it instead of improving it .
On 1 January 2002 , the euro will become legal tender within the euro zone .
If the euro is to bring greater freedom to individuals and companies and increased rationality in their decision making , they must previously have become familiar with the new system .
Although the compromise reached by our committee on this issue was particularly difficult to achieve , the facts seem to justify this . Following the political agreement achieved in the last Council of Ministers , both tuna fillets and herring now fall outside the tariff suspension system , in addition to another set of corrections affecting other products contained in Annex V .
A real market problem exists and it is the whole of this profession that is being ruined .
Today , the report submitted to us strengthens the place of the consumer and the producers &apos; organisations in the organisation of the market .
( Parliament rejected the request for referral back to committee )
Everything seems to show that our fellow citizens do not see any point at all in actually changing to the euro in their daily lives .
So what is going on ?
It has been on the agenda of many national parliaments for many years .
Fifty years on , I feel that priorities have changed .
Developing countries have shown a new determination to resist such marginalisation .
The American President &apos;s statement that if labour standards were not implemented then sanctions might be imposed was far from helpful .
I believe that is something worth thinking about .
I have now presented to you the Court of Auditors &apos; annual report for 1998 .
Accordingly , we must call an immediate halt to financing from structural funds projects that are at odds with objectives relating to environmental protection .
The Commission must , at the same time , dare to impose clear demands and requirements on the Member States &apos; control systems .
Does the exchange of educational methods affect the principle of subsidiarity ?
We believe that the mobility measures contained in the Socrates programme foster social skills , language skills and understanding for other cultures .
This is based , amongst other things , on technical data recommended by ICES , the scientific organisation , and now Russia and Norway want to break away and , on the basis of a bilateral agreement , fish possibly three to four times the quantity recommended by the scientists .
Why should the directive not apply in this case ?
The Commission is of the opinion that the common position established by the Council is well @-@ balanced and coherent .
That is why I should like to ask that at long last we be prepared to negotiate on this and not dig our heels in and simply refuse to discuss anything with each other .
Arguments of this kind have been put forward but , as far as I am concerned , these are just attempts to cloud the issue .
There is , then , no good reason for postponing further measures which we can take right now .
Expanding it is unnecessary and limiting it is of little , if any , practical consequence .
How can you check up on this because it may involve hundreds of tonnes of goods which you are unaware are being imported .
I believe that the industry has accepted that target , but with some trepidation .
Very wisely , in my judgement , the European Council decided to launch this Conference as early as February next year , as we had repeatedly requested , with open minds regarding the agenda .
We are expecting good levels of cooperation with Parliament as the reforms are drafted .
Otherwise , we run the risk of producing unwanted reactions .
However , the deadline being set down for the next intergovernmental conference is very ambitious indeed .
I think that pretending everything is going well , when the choice that has been made goes decidedly in the direction of enlarging the Union without deepening it , is profoundly wrong .
Mr President , I thank every one for the kind comments they have made here regarding Finland , as the country holding the Presidency , but at the same time I would also like to thank people for the criticisms that have been made .
It has shown its understanding by taking part in the occupation of Kosovo and in its continuing efforts to overturn the democratically @-@ elected Yugoslav leadership .
Why does the EU not use the OSCE in order to achieve a stability pact for the Caucasus with these countries , the Russian Federation , the United States and Turkey ?
Mr President , I shall make three very straightforward points .
This will mean the urgently needed substantial sums will go to Kosovo and East Timor without any unwarranted delays .
I would like some clarification on that point .
On this last point , I would like to add that the tradition of sums being earmarked for supporting refugees was started by the European Parliament in 1997 and annual decisions have been taken on it .
The debate is closed .
To my mind , the agenda of the Council of Education Ministers of 26 November could have made use of the proposal of a permanent committee on quality in education .
However , we all know that , unfortunately , the silk routes were followed by the oil route , then the cocaine route and then the heroin route and now , unfortunately , we are witnessing the emergence of a trafficking route for these materials which are a serious threat to the peace and security of all citizens .
At the risk of being suspected of reverting provocatively to earlier discussions in Parliament , I very much hope that the important programmes that we are trying to launch in the Balkans will not be held hostage as Parliament and the Council argue and disagree about funding for next year .
But I have to say that I cannot agree with you that it is a simple exchange rate issue because it would not account for the fact that some cars cost around four thousand pounds more in the UK than they do , for example , in the Netherlands .
We shall support you in a constructively critical manner on this question of the future development of the Technical Assistance Offices .
Shall we , at the same time , tell him that we agree to reduce reconstruction aid for his country by one third ?
The compromise negotiated between the Council and Parliament which lies before us today takes no account whatsoever of this basic position of Parliament .
It was therefore naturally depressing that , as late as yesterday , we had not reached a final conclusion , despite the significant degree of essential unity .
As required under Article 35 of our Rules of Procedure , the Committee on Budgetary Control interviewed and questioned the proposed candidates individually on 22 and 23 November 1999 on the basis of the provisions of the Treaty which require that candidates must hold or have held or be particularly suitable for an auditing office .
On the other hand , the discussion of the legal basis of this report has also been polemical , although in the end the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market approved it , finally defining it under Article 235 , a decision which did not please many of us .
It is inevitable that this evening our minds should be focused on Russia and that our thoughts should be with the people of Grozny as they spend a further night under threat of bombardment .
Nevertheless , because of a different certification system , but also for procedural reasons , the United States could not adopt a similar decision .
In our opinion , multilateral commitment to a policy on climate will , in the long term , guarantee optimum results .
What is in fact missing , however , is the concrete implementation of measures to combat this .
Even worse , under pressure from powerful nuclear lobbies , nuclear energy has nearly succeeded in being recognised as a renewable source of energy . This would be a disaster in itself .
Mr President , Members of the European Parliament , I have been listening to this debate with great interest , and it must be said that that I have nothing but respect for the high level of knowledge the European Parliament has regarding this subject .
The European Union will continue to take a close interest in Macao after 19 December .
These are the links which you are preparing to break .
I agree with Mrs Theorin that the situation is particularly dramatic for women in many places on the planet and is becoming critical .
( Parliament approved the Commission proposal )
We can make this work , though as I say there are one or two problems with precise wordings that we will want to come back to .
Obviously , it is equally important to increase the Community &apos; s commitment to scientific research to find cures for all types of disease .
The European Union , shaken by the resignation of the Santer Commission during preparations , pursued a policy of seeking compromise with the other major powers which was far removed from the claims of developing countries and the concerns of civil society .
I am not questioning Mr Martin &apos; s extensive ability to conduct our business swiftly but , like other Members , I am questioning a general practice which seems to completely contradict the letter of our Rules of Procedure and the spirit of the parliamentary institutions .
The European Union , or rather the European Parliament , must not just be present during this procedure ; it must make a decisive contribution , both to the evaluation of the five years of action and to future plans .
He will also be happy to meet interested Members of Parliament individually or as a group to discuss the issue further .
This is very interesting .
Only where there is scientifically substantiated and provable cause for concern can the free movement of goods be excluded and suspended in order to protect consumer health .
I find this a dangerous tendency in EU politics .
We understand .
It is an unthinkable proposition .
It is therefore clear that there is something that does not add up in what you are telling us .
The Council wishes to point out that all EU Member States voted in favour of a provisional resolution on the issue , which the Committee of Ministers in the Council of Europe adopted on 6 October 1999 , and which stated that the terms of payment proposed by the Turkish government could not be considered to be in compliance with the obligations in respect of the court decision taken , and forcefully urged Turkey to re @-@ examine her position .
No , in the end , surprisingly , there has been a question , although I did not know initially whether it was a question or not .
Mr President , I am completely satisfied with the Council &apos; s reply but , before this part of this sitting ends , I would like to ask the Bureau when it intends to decide on the issue , as we are having a debate on Mr von Wogau &apos; s report on the important issue of competition policy and state aid policy , which was meant in fact for this morning , but which today was put back by several hours .
It provides the legal framework to deter late payers from paying late or from imposing unduly long payment periods on their partners .
I imagine that the Council will soon meet in extraordinary session , probably before Christmas , and will do something to ensure that there is no vacuum , chaos and confusion .
Now to the role of the Commission .
However there were good and justifiable reasons for this delay .
No major buyer or producer of milk and milk products anywhere in the world has permitted the use of this hormone , apart from the USA .
All Member States have also ratified this convention .
In any case , it is your card which is recorded when voting .
I completely agree .
I therefore demand that explanations of vote from those who are not present should not be valid .
It would not be amiss if public administrations in the fifteen Member States were subject to the same attention as private administrations .
Parliament has taken note of the fact that Turkey has been included as a candidate country .
In this sense we hope , Commissioner , that you and the Commission will be able to grant Parliament &apos; s wish , the wish which it has expressed here and in the documents of this legislation .
Why will the Commission not take up our proposal to extend the fixed book price system to all Member States ?
However , European people are not the same throughout the Union and European culture thrives on its diversity .
What we have to do is make it clear to the army that it is now being closely watched by the public worldwide , especially in the EU , and that we take the liberty of drawing our conclusions from the behaviour of the military .
The peace agreement offered improved conditions to only a very small number of the RUF hierarchy .
3 . Arrest of the President of the Audit Office in Nicaragua- B5 @-@ 0375 / 1999 by Mr Liese and others , on behalf of the PPE / DE Group , on the arrest of Agustín Jarquín , President of the Audit Office of Nicaragua .
For Islam and Christianity both uphold the rights of women , and the abuses of human rights against women that are taking place in Afghanistan , and have been taking place for so long now , are against the ethics of Islam .
Without financial help from Paris and without the presence of one of the main bases of the French army abroad , this regime would not last a month .
Mr President , genocide , war crimes , crimes against humanity and acts of aggression involving actions against third countries are the four types of crime which could be tried in the international criminal court .
It is true that the wind was blowing . It was even stormy .
De Rossa ( PSE ) .
When Finland became a Member , as a result of poor yield in previous years , we had to be satisfied with a figure that did not reflect the truth in normal years .
I have no doubt , Mr Mayer .
I would like to remind the Commission of this .
Having said that , Parliament has reached the end of the agenda .
