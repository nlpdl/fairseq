the global economy &apos;s center of gravity is moving to Asia , Latin America , and Africa , but the IMF and the World Bank still seem to mirror the reality of the 1950s .
if the Fed is seen as unleashing a major crisis in emerging markets , this will almost certainly do long @-@ term damage to the global financial system .
the Fed should regard lower commodity prices , reduced inflationary pressures , changes in the labor market , and further disruptive technological shifts as sufficiently convincing arguments to postpone a rate hike .
including the risk of excessive volatility in the global financial system tips the balance even further .
there is plenty of time for the Fed to signal that its policy stance has shifted , and the conclave in Jackson Hole is an excellent opportunity to start that communication .
if the facts have changed , the policy implications must also change .
the greatest loss of credibility always comes when policymakers try to ignore changing realities .
why the Greek Bailout Failed
Cambridge - As the Greek crisis evolves , it is important to understand that a successful structural @-@ adjustment program requires strong country ownership .
even if negotiators overcome the most recent sticking points , it will be difficult to trust in their implementation if the Greek people remain unconvinced .
that has certainly been the experience so far .
and without structural reform , there is little chance that the Greek economy will see sustained stability and growth - not least because official lenders are unwilling to continue extending an unreformed Greece significantly more money than it is asked to pay .
( this has been the case through most of the crisis , even if one would never know it from the world press coverage . )
Greece &apos;s membership in the European Union gives its creditors significant leverage , but evidently not enough to change the fundamental calculus .
Greece remains very much a sovereign country , not a sub @-@ sovereign state .
the &quot; troika &quot; of creditors - the International Monetary Fund , the European Central Bank , and the European Commission - simply do not enjoy the kind of leverage over Greece that , say , the Municipal Assistance Corporation wielded over New York City when it teetered on the edge of bankruptcy in the mid @-@ 1970s .
the best structural @-@ adjustment programs are those in which the debtor country &apos;s government proposes the policy changes , and the IMF helps design a bespoke program and provides the political cover for its implementation .
imposing them from the outside is simply not an effective option .
so , for reforms to take hold , the Greek government and its electorate must believe in them .
that a country must take ownership of its reform program is not a new lesson .
the IMF &apos;s rocky relationship with Ukraine began long before the latest round of negotiations .
back in 2013 , IMF staff wrote a sobering report on the organization &apos;s experience in the country .
their conclusion , in essence , was that the government &apos;s failure to embrace the reform process fully all but guaranteed that its program would not work .
if a government is incapable of or uninterested in making the needed adjustments , the report argued , the best option is to drip money out as reforms are implemented , as is now being done in Greece .
unfortunately , that approach has not proved adequate to overcome the challenges there .
structural @-@ reform conditions often tilt the balance between competing domestic factions , for better or for worse .
if there is no will inside the country to maintain the reforms , they will quickly be undermined .
left @-@ wing ideologues have long viewed structural @-@ reform programs with deep suspicion , accusing international lenders like the IMF and the World Bank of being captured by neoliberal market fundamentalists .
this critique has some truth in it , but is overblown .
to be sure , structural reforms often favor policies like labor @-@ market flexibility .
but one should not make the mistake of viewing these interventions in black @-@ and @-@ white terms .
breaking down dual labor markets that are excluding young workers ( as they do in much of southern Europe , including Italy and , to some extent , France ) is very different from making it easier to fire all workers .
making pension systems sustainable does not amount to making them stingier .
making tax systems simpler and fairer is not the same as raising all taxes .
recently , opponents of structural reform have put forward more exotic objections - most notably the problem caused by deflation when policy interest rates are at zero .
if structural reforms simply lower all wages and prices , it may indeed be difficult in the short @-@ term to counter the drop in aggregate demand .
but a similar critique could be made of any other change in policy : if it is poorly designed , it will be counter @-@ productive .
the truth is that the way forward in Europe requires achieving greater productivity .
the lessons from Greece and other unsuccessful bailout programs are sobering .
if a debt bailout program requires a wholesale change in a country &apos;s economic , social , and political model , the best course of action might be to write off the private losses , rather than pour in public money to cover them .
in cases like Greece , the creditors &quot; passion for structural reforms might be better directed at home - particularly toward improving financial regulation .
the vast majority of Greeks want to stay in the EU .
in an ideal world , offering financial aid in exchange for reforms might help those in the country who want to shape it into a modern European state .
but given the difficulty Greece has had so far in making the necessary changes to reach that goal , it might be time to reconsider this approach to the crisis completely .
in place of a program providing the country with further loans , it might make more sense to provide outright humanitarian aid - regardless of whether Greece remains fully within the eurozone .
why the Greek Deal Will Work
London - Now that Greek banks have reopened and the government has made scheduled payments to the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund , does Greece &apos;s near @-@ death experience mark the end of the euro crisis ?
the conventional answer is a clear no .
according to most economists and political commentators , the latest Greek bailout was little more than an analgesic .
it will dull the pain for a short period , but the euro &apos;s deep @-@ seated problems will metastasize , with a dismal prognosis for the single currency and perhaps even the European Union as a whole .
but the conventional wisdom is likely to be proved wrong .
the deal between Greece and the European authorities is actually a good one for both sides .
rather than marking the beginning of a new phase of the euro crisis , the agreement may be remembered as the culmination of a long series of political compromises that , by correcting some of the euro &apos;s worst design flaws , created the conditions for a European economic recovery .
to express guarded optimism about the Greek deal is not to condone the provocative arrogance of former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis or the pointless vindictiveness of German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble .
neither is it to deny the economic criticism of the bailout provisions presented by progressives like Joseph Stiglitz and conservatives like Hans @-@ Werner Sinn .
the arguments against creating a European single currency and then allowing Greece to cheat its way into membership were valid back in the 1990s - and , in theory , they still are .
but this does not mean that breaking up the euro would be desirable , or even tolerable .
joining the euro was certainly ruinous for Greece , but there is always &quot; a great deal of ruin in a nation , &quot; as Adam Smith remarked 250 years ago , when losing the American colonies seemed to threaten Britain with financial devastation .
the great virtue of capitalism is that it adapts to ruinous conditions and even finds ways of turning them to advantage .
the United States in the mid @-@ nineteenth century was badly suited for a single currency and a single economic structure , as evidenced by the Civil War , which was provoked as much by single @-@ currency tensions as by moral abhorrence to slavery .
Italy would probably be better off today if Garibaldi had never launched unification .
but once unification has happened , the pain of dismantling the political and economic settlement usually overwhelms the apparent gains from a break @-@ up .
this seems to be the case in Europe , as clear majorities of voters are saying in all eurozone countries , including Germany and Greece .
thus , the question was never whether the single currency would break up , but what political reversals , economic sacrifices , and legal subterfuges would occur to hold it together .
the good news is that Europe now has some persuasive answers .
indeed , Europe has overcome what could be described as the &quot; original sin &quot; of the single @-@ currency project : the Maastricht Treaty &apos;s prohibition of &quot; monetary financing &quot; of government deficits by the ECB and the related ban on mutual support by national governments of one another &apos;s debt burdens .
in January , ECB President Mario Draghi effectively sidestepped both obstacles by launching a program of quantitative easing so enormous that it will finance the entire deficits of all eurozone governments ( now including Greece ) and mutualize a significant proportion of their outstanding bonds .
moreover , European governments have belatedly understood the most basic principle of public finance .
government debts never have to be repaid , provided they can be extended in a cooperative manner or bought up with newly created money , issued by a credible central bank .
but for this to be possible , interest payments must always be made on time , and the sanctity of debt contracts must always take precedence over electoral promises regarding pensions , wages , and public spending .
now that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras &apos;s government has been forced to acknowledge the unqualified priority of debt servicing , and can now benefit from unlimited monetary support from the ECB , Greece should have little problem supporting its debt burden , which is no heavier than Japan &apos;s or Italy &apos;s .
finally , Germany , Spain , Italy , and several northern European countries required , for domestic political reasons , a ritual humiliation of radical Greek politicians and voters who openly defied EU institutions and austerity demands .
having achieved this , EU leaders have no further reason to impose austerity on Greece or strictly enforce the terms of the latest bailout .
instead , they have every incentive to demonstrate the success of their &quot; tough love &quot; policies by easing austerity to accelerate economic growth , not only in Greece but throughout the eurozone .
this raises a key issue that the Tsipras government and many others misunderstood throughout the Greek crisis : the role of constructive hypocrisy in Europe &apos;s political economy .
gaps between public statements and private intentions open up in all political systems , but these become huge in a complex multinational structure like the EU .
on paper , the Greek bailout will impose a fiscal tightening , thereby aggravating the country &apos;s economic slump .
in practice , however , the budget targets will surely be allowed to slip , provided the government carries out its promises on privatization , labor markets , and pension reform .
these structural reforms are much more important than fiscal targets , both in symbolic terms for the rest of Europe and for the Greek economy .
moreover , the extension of ECB monetary support to Greece will transform financial conditions : interest rates will plummet , banks will recapitalize , and private credit will gradually become available for the first time since 2010 .
if budget targets were strictly enforced by bailout monitors , which seems unlikely , this improvement in conditions for private borrowers could easily compensate for any modest tightening of fiscal policy .
in short , the main conditions now seem to be in place for a sustainable recovery in Greece .
conventional wisdom among economists and investors has a long record of failing to spot major turning points ; so the near @-@ universal belief today that Greece faces permanent depression is no reason to despair .
money @-@ Market Resistance
Cambridge - The United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) recently rejected proposed rules aimed at making money @-@ market funds safer in a financial crisis - a rejection that has caused consternation among observers and other regulators .
given the risks that money market funds can pose to the global financial system , as shown by their destabilizing role in the 2008 financial crisis , it is not hard to see why they are worried .
money @-@ market funds take excess cash from investors and use it to purchase short @-@ term IOUs from businesses , banks , and other financial institutions .
they mimic bank accounts by allowing investors to write checks and promise that their investment &apos;s value will not fall .
in 2012 , American &quot; prime &quot; money @-@ market funds , which buy bank and corporate debt , were worth nearly $ 1.5 trillion .
the money flowing through these funds went to many of the world &apos;s largest banks , including not just the obvious US suspects ( JP Morgan Chase , Bank of America , and Citi ) , but also major European and Japanese banks such as Barclays , Deutsche Bank , Bank of Tokyo , Sumitomo , Credit Suisse , and ING .
these six international banks alone accounted for nearly 20 % of the prime money @-@ market funds &quot; value .
many readers know how money @-@ market funds work : an investor buys a $ 1.00 share from the XYZ fund , which keeps each share &apos;s value at a constant $ 1.00 , allowing the investor to believe that the money - invested in a pool of safe , secure , but not always government @-@ guaranteed assets - is on deposit .
even if the asset pool declines in value , the fund &apos;s managers keep the value of each share at $ 1.00 by rounding upward the fund &apos;s real value .
if the fund &apos;s losses are big enough that rounding off still leaves it short of a stable $ 1.00 value , the fund &quot; breaks the buck . &quot;
that happened when Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008 .
the Reserve Fund , a well @-@ established money @-@ market fund with too many unpaid IOUs from Lehman , could not keep its value steady . it broke the buck .
all money @-@ market funds then became suspect , and many investors fled - withdrawing one @-@ third of a trillion dollars in a single week .
since much of the money @-@ market funds &quot; assets are IOUs from the world &apos;s biggest banks , the withdrawals weakened the already @-@ shaky global banking system .
the Federal Reserve , seeking to stem the growing panic and stabilize the American and international banking system , promptly guaranteed the value of all money @-@ market funds .
the proposals that the SEC rejected were aimed at making money @-@ market funds more robust by requiring that each fund maintain capital reserves or let its value &quot; float &quot; - and not be rounded up - to reflect its true , underlying risk .
the proposal would also have required that money @-@ market funds hold back a fraction of some redemptions , thereby making investors take some risk that funds might not have complete transactional liquidity if their investments weakened .
a majority of the commissioners turned down the proposals after substantial lobbying from the mutual @-@ fund industry .
if money @-@ market funds had to maintain capital reserves , industry representatives argued , yields to investors would decline and the industry &apos;s profits would suffer .
and , if retail investors saw their money @-@ market funds &quot; values declining from the amount that they had invested , and if they knew that they could not get all of their money back immediately , the funds would become less attractive .
investors might choose other places for their excess cash , like banks .
banks are obliged to hold reserves , maintain capital , and pay deposit insurance to ensure that they can honor their deposits .
the mutual @-@ fund industry , one can assume , feared that the SEC &apos;s rules would induce customers to redirect much of their cash directly into banks .
as a result of the SEC &apos;s inaction , money @-@ market funds will continue to operate outside the scope of bank @-@ style rules on capital and reserves , even though investors treat them like bank accounts .
unlike banks , though , they do not pay the government to insure their investors .
but the 2008 financial crisis showed that , when push comes to shove , the government will backstop money @-@ market funds nonetheless .
the rejected proposals are thus good policy : money @-@ market funds should be made safer - via capital requirements and liquidity restrictions - because they already receive a de facto government guarantee .
their steady value makes them appear safer to investors than they are to the world &apos;s financial system .
the SEC &apos;s rejection of the proposed rules demonstrates the power of concerted lobbying - and that concentrated interests often trump diffuse benefits .
typically , an interest group lobbies Congress , blandishing persuasive arguments , campaign contributions , and other support ; often enough members - or enough key members - come to see the merit of the group &apos;s point of view ( or at least vote as if they do ) .
meanwhile , ordinary citizens do not notice unless the issue receives significant media attention .
often no one lobbies the other side of the issue .
one might think that banks would counter @-@ balance the mutual @-@ fund industry &apos;s lobbying efforts , because the likely effect of forcing money @-@ market funds to pay for more of their systemic costs would be to expand funds flowing directly to banks .
but inflows through money @-@ market funds are not so bad for banks , which get the cash without having to set aside reserves or pay for deposit insurance .
some banks may even prefer these flows to direct deposits .
so the mutual @-@ fund industry had the regulators all to itself .
its lobbyists told the SEC commissioners that current rules already did everything possible to ensure safety ; that retail investors want money @-@ market funds &quot; steady value ; that change would hurt all investors ; and that the recent Dodd @-@ Frank financial @-@ reform legislation disrupts regulators &quot; ability to bail out money @-@ market funds next time .
other regulators were watching , as were academics and journalists - and some regulators may now feel compelled to take over the money @-@ market safety rules from the SEC or push the SEC back into action .
with no one having a direct financial interest in the outcome pressing an alternative view , the SEC &apos;s initial decision was as predictable as it was bad .
transatlantic Free Trade ?
Madrid - This month , the United States National Intelligence Council released a sobering report entitled Global Trends 2030 : alternative Worlds .
most important , according to the authors , if current trends continue , Asia could soon surpass North America and Europe in global power .
it will have a higher GDP , larger population , higher military spending , and more technological investment .
in this geopolitical context , Europe and the US need each other more than ever , making greater transatlantic cooperation crucial .
this seems to be the approach that inspired outgoing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s recent speech at the Brookings Institution on US @-@ European relations .
given the shift in global power and the prospect of US energy self @-@ sufficiency as domestic hydrocarbon output booms , America is trying to adapt its foreign policy to the new multi @-@ polar international order .
and , although Asia is now America &apos;s strategic priority , Europe is still the partner with which Americans have the most in common .
&quot; I want to be clear , &quot; Clinton noted . &quot; our reorientation toward Asia is not a withdrawal from Europe . &quot;
the US , according to Clinton , hopes that Europe will follow suit , so that Asia is seen not only as a market , but also as a focus of common strategic action .
but , beyond that , as the US and Europe seek to ensure their global roles , cooperation between them is more important than ever .
so now is the time for a bold initiative : the launch of a US @-@ European Union free @-@ trade agreement .
Clinton has already hinted at America &apos;s readiness for this , mentioning the possibility of negotiating a complete agreement that would increase trade and stimulate growth on both sides of the Atlantic .
the journalist David Ignatius even dared to give it a name in a recent article in The Washington Post : TAFTA ( Transatlantic Free @-@ Trade Agreement ) .
Edward Luce , writing in the Financial Times , preferred &quot; Transatlantic Partnership . &quot;
the US and the EU ( taken as a whole ) are not only the world &apos;s two largest economies and typically the largest commercial partners for other major economies ; they also maintain the world &apos;s largest bilateral trade relationship .
American investment in Europe is three times higher than it is in Asia .
European investment in the US is eight times larger than its investments in China and India combined .
so transatlantic trade is crucial for both economies , particularly for job creation .
indeed , it is estimated that one @-@ third of all bilateral US @-@ EU trade consists of internal transfers by companies that operate in both markets .
although US and EU tariffs on each other &apos;s marketed manufactured goods are already low ( below 3 % , on average ) , a free @-@ trade agreement would be enormously beneficial in promoting further investment , thereby boosting economic growth and creating more jobs .
such an agreement could include trade in goods , services , financial instruments , and agriculture , and would necessitate greater compatibility of European and American regulations and legal norms , implying substantial savings .
moreover , the effects of such an agreement would be felt far beyond the US and Europe .
for example , both have already signed free @-@ trade treaties with various Latin American countries , implying the creation of a geographically enormous free @-@ trade area , which should boost economic resilience in the face of global crisis .
indeed , regional free @-@ trade agreements are gaining momentum worldwide .
the Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership , a free @-@ trade agreement spearheaded by the US , is set to be a game @-@ changer in the Asia @-@ Pacific region , with decisive advances this year putting it on course to be concluded in 2015 .
potential signatories include the US , Australia , Malaysia , Vietnam , Singapore , New Zealand , Chile , Peru , Brunei , Canada , Mexico , and perhaps Japan and South Korea .
the result will be trade liberalization in an area that produces 40 % of global GDP .
isn &apos;t it time to consider something similar for Europe and the US ?
the EU , now confronting a wave of populism and Euro @-@ skepticism , could revive its sense of purpose by committing itself to closer transatlantic cooperation and coordination on trade , to be carried out by the European Commission .
such a project has worked before in bringing Europe together ; it can do so again .
the most precious asset today is confidence , and the mere fact of launching negotiations would generate it in abundance .
protectionism is no solution to the crisis , whereas a transatlantic free @-@ trade agreement would favor multilateralism and openness .
in this sense , it is important to stress the work of the World Trade Organization , the best multilateral forum that the world has for resolving trade disputes .
signing a transatlantic trade treaty would be irrefutable proof that the political case for open trade can be made - and won .
the only way to achieve this is through the clear commitment of political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic , together with private @-@ sector involvement , which is fundamental to sustaining urgently needed economic growth .
but let &apos;s not wait : faced with predictions of the West &apos;s relative decline , the US and the EU must commit themselves to more union , more cooperation , and more prosperity .
today , that means a transatlantic free @-@ trade agreement .
financial Reform &apos;s Breakthrough Year
Zanzibar - Here &apos;s an odd prediction for the coming year : 2013 will be a watershed for financial reform .
true , while the global financial crisis erupted more than four years ago , and the Dodd @-@ Frank financial reforms were adopted in the United States back in 2010 , not much has changed about how Wall Street operates - except that the large firms have become bigger and more powerful .
yet there are reasons to expect real progress in the new year .
the US Federal Reserve is finally shifting its thinking .
in a series of major speeches this fall , Governor Dan Tarullo made the case that the problem of &quot; too big to fail &quot; financial institutions remains with us .
we need to take additional measures to reduce the level of systemic risk - including limiting the size of our largest banks .
news reports indicate that the Fed has already started saying no to some bank mergers .
at the same time , the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has become a bastion of sensible thinking on financial @-@ sector issues .
in part , this is because the FDIC is responsible for cleaning up the mess when financial @-@ sector firms fail , so its senior officials have a strong incentive to protect its insurance fund by preventing risks from getting out of control .
the FDIC is showing intellectual leadership as well as organizational capabilities - Vice Chairman Tom Hoenig &apos;s speeches are a must @-@ read .
Wall Street is pushing back , of course .
but the rolling series of scandals surrounding global megabanks makes it difficult for anyone to keep a straight face when executives insist that our largest banks must maintain their current scale and scope .
do we need HSBC to facilitate global money laundering ?
do we need Barclays and UBS to manipulate Libor ( a key benchmark for interest rates around the world ) ?
do we need still more losses at poorly run trading operations for JP Morgan Chase ?
the pro @-@ bank lobby groups are positioning themselves to argue that the new resolution powers under Dodd @-@ Frank have ended the too @-@ big @-@ to @-@ fail problem , and we can expect a public @-@ relations drive in this direction early in the new year .
but the consensus view at the most recent meeting of the FDIC &apos;s Systemic Resolution Advisory Committee ( of which I am a member ) was that this claim should not be taken seriously .
under Dodd @-@ Frank , it is arguably easier for the FDIC to handle the failure of a single large financial institution than it was in pre @-@ Dodd @-@ Frank days .
but what if two or three or seven firms are all in trouble at the same time ?
the answer , as former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker implied at the meeting , is that we would be right back where we started - in the panic and frozen credit markets that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 .
indeed , the idea that substantial shocks could soon hit the US financial system is not far @-@ fetched .
the European debt crisis , for example , remains far from being resolved .
a significant sovereign @-@ debt restructuring there would bring down European banks and potentially damage US banks - as well as financial institutions around the world .
meanwhile , the continuing problems at European banks are a stark reminder that operating highly leveraged , thinly capitalized firms is incredibly risky .
and the regulatory failures in Europe - consider the German Landesbanks , for example - will become only more obvious in the coming months .
creating a common supervisory authority will mean nothing unless it can clean up the mess created by the existing supervisors .
and that cleanup will expose more of the rot in banks &quot; current operations .
the need for banks to finance themselves with more equity and relatively less debt will be the focus of one of the main publishing events in economics in 2013 .
Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig &apos;s The Bankers &quot; New Clothes : what &apos;s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About it ? will appear officially in March , but advance copies are already being closely read in leading central banks .
bankers everywhere will rush to read it before their regulators do .
the road to the ongoing financial and economic crisis was built on a foundation of intellectual capture : not only regulators , but academics , too , became captivated by modern finance and its methods .
Admati and Hellwig are at the vanguard of the counterrevolution , challenging the great myths of banking head @-@ on .
do we need financial institutions to be so highly leveraged ( that is , carrying so much debt relative to equity ) ?
no , they argue .
if banks of all kinds were financed with more equity , they would have stronger buffers to absorb losses .
both the equity and the debt issued by well @-@ capitalized banks would be safer - and therefore cheaper .
bankers want to be so highly leveraged for a simple reason : implicit government guarantees mean that they get the upside when things go well , while the downside is someone else &apos;s problem .
contrary to bankers &quot; claims , this is not a good arrangement for society .
Admati and Hellwig are confronting the bankers and their allies in no uncertain terms , grounding their argument in deep financial thinking , yet writing for a broad audience .
whatever else happens in 2013 , we can be sure that they will not win the Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year award .
in Defense of Non @-@ Visionaries
Oxford - Many of the recent tributes for Margaret Thatcher following her death celebrated her as a &quot; transformational &quot; leader who brought about great changes .
there were frequent references to her equally transformational American counterpart , Ronald Reagan .
but a more interesting comparison is with her other presidential contemporary , George H. W. Bush .
though often dismissed as a mere &quot; transactional &quot; manager , Bush had one of the best foreign @-@ policy records of the past half @-@ century .
his administration managed the end of the Cold War , the dismantlement of the Soviet Union , and the unification of Germany within NATO - all without violence .
at the same time , he led a broad United Nations @-@ backed coalition that repelled Saddam Hussein &apos;s aggression against Kuwait .
had he dropped any of the balls he was juggling , today &apos;s world would be much worse .
although he presided over a major global transformation , Bush , by his own account , did not have transformational objectives .
on the unification of Germany , he resisted the advice of Thatcher and others , apparently out of a sense of fairness and responsiveness to his friend , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
in October 1989 , Bush responded to a call from Kohl by publicly stating that he did not &quot; share the concern that some European countries have about a reunified Germany . &quot;
at the same time , he was careful to let Kohl and others take the lead .
when the Berlin Wall was opened a month later , partly owing to an East German mistake , Bush was criticized for his low @-@ key response .
but Bush had made a deliberate choice not to humiliate the Soviets or gloat : &quot; I won &apos;t beat on my chest and dance on the wall , &quot; was his response - a model of emotional intelligence in a leader .
such self @-@ restraint helped to set the stage for the successful Malta Summit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev a month later .
the Cold War ended quietly , and the dismantlement of the Soviet empire followed .
as Bush and his team responded to forces that were largely outside of his control , he set goals and objectives that balanced opportunities and constraints in a prudent manner .
some critics have faulted him for not supporting the national aspirations of Soviet republics like Ukraine in 1991 ( when he delivered his infamous &quot; Chicken Kiev &quot; speech warning against &quot; suicidal nationalism &quot; ) ; for failing to go to Baghdad to unseat Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War ; or for sending Brent Scowcroft to Beijing to maintain relations with China after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 .
but , in each instance , Bush was limiting his short @-@ term gains in order to pursue long @-@ term stability .
other critics complained that Bush did not set more transformational objectives regarding Russian democracy , the Middle East , or nuclear non @-@ proliferation at a time when world politics seemed fluid .
but , again , Bush remained more focused on maintaining global stability than on advancing new visions .
Bush was also respectful of institutions and norms at home and abroad , going to the US Congress for authorization of the Gulf War , and to the United Nations for a resolution under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter .
although a realist in his thinking , he could be Wilsonian in his tactics .
Bush &apos;s termination of the ground war in Iraq after only four days was motivated in part by humanitarian concerns about the slaughter of Iraqi troops , as well as by an interest in not leaving Iraq so weakened that it could not balance the power of neighboring Iran .
while Bush &apos;s invasion of Panama to capture ( and later put on trial ) Manuel Noriega may have violated Panamanian sovereignty , it had a degree of de facto legitimacy , given Noriega &apos;s notorious behavior .
and , when Bush organized his international coalition to prosecute the Gulf War , he included several Arab countries - not to ensure military success , but to boost the mission &apos;s legitimacy .
when Bush and Thatcher met in Aspen , Colorado , in the summer of 1990 , Thatcher allegedly warned him &quot; not to go wobbly . &quot;
but most historians agree there was no such danger .
with his careful combination of hard and soft power , Bush created a successful strategy - one that accomplished American goals in a manner that was not unduly insular and with minimal damage to the interests of foreigners .
he was careful not to humiliate Gorbachev , and to manage the transition to Boris Yeltsin &apos;s presidency in a newly independent Russia .
of course , not all foreigners were adequately protected .
for example , Bush assigned a low priority to Kurds and Shia in Iraq , to dissidents in China , and to Bosnians in the former Yugoslavia .
in that sense , Bush &apos;s realism set limits to his cosmopolitanism .
could Bush have done more had he been a transformational leader like Thatcher or Reagan ?
perhaps he might have done more in a second term .
and , with better communication skills , he might have been able to do more to educate the American public about the changing nature of the post @-@ Cold War world .
but , given the profound uncertainty of a world in flux , as well as the dangers of miscalculation as the Soviet empire collapsed , prudent management trumped grand visions .
Bush famously said that he did not do &quot; the vision thing . &quot;
nonetheless , few people at the end of 1989 believed that Germany could be reunited peacefully within the Western alliance .
Thatcher certainly did not .
the lesson is that in some circumstances , we should prefer leadership by good transactional managers like George H. W. Bush ( or Dwight Eisenhower before him ) , rather than by more flashy and inspirational transformers .
should Business Travel Be obsolete ?
Colombo - Think about it : you can call , email , and even watch your counterparty on FaceTime , Skype , or GoToMeeting .
so why do companies fork out more than $ 1.2 trillion a year - a full 1.5 % of the world &apos;s GDP - for international business travel ?
the expense is not only huge ; it is also growing - at 6.5 % per year , almost twice the rate of global economic growth and almost as fast as information and telecommunication services .
computing power has moved from our laptops and cellphones to the cloud , and we are all better off for it .
so why do we need to move brains instead of letting those brains stay put and just sending them bytes ?
why waste precious work time in the air , at security checks , and waiting for our luggage ?
before anyone starts slashing travel budgets , let &apos;s try to understand why we need to move people rather than information .
thanks to a research collaboration on inclusive growth with MasterCard and an anonymized donation of data to the Center for International Development at Harvard University , we are starting to shed some light on this mystery .
in ongoing work with Dany Bahar , Michele Coscia , and Frank Neffke , we have been able to establish some interesting stylized facts .
more populous countries have more business travel in both directions , but the volume is less than proportional to their population : a country with 100 % more population than another has only about 70 % more business travel .
this suggests that there are economies of scale in running businesses that favor large countries .
by contrast , a country with a per capita income that is 100 % higher than another receives 130 % more business travelers and sends 170 % more people abroad .
this means that business travel tends to grow more than proportionally with the level of development .
while businesspeople travel in order to trade or invest , more than half of international business travel seems to be related to the management of foreign subsidiaries .
the global economy is increasingly characterized by global firms , which need to deploy their know @-@ how to their different locations around the world .
the data show that there is almost twice the amount of travel from headquarters to subsidiaries as there is in the opposite direction .
exporters also travel twice as much as importers .
but why do we need to move the brain , not just the bytes ?
I can think of at least two reasons .
first , the brain has a capacity to absorb information , identify patterns , and solve problems without us being aware of how it does it .
that is why we can , for example , infer other people &apos;s goals and intentions from facial expressions , body language , intonation , and other subtle indicators that we gather unconsciously .
when we attend a meeting in person , we can listen to the body language , not just the spoken word , and we can choose where to look , not just the particular angle that the video screen shows .
as a consequence , we are better able to evaluate , empathize , and bond in person than we can with today &apos;s telecom technologies .
second , the brain is designed to work in parallel with other brains .
many problem @-@ solving tasks require parallel computing with brains that possess different software and information but that can coordinate their thoughts .
that is why we have design teams , advisory boards , inter @-@ agency taskforces , and other forms of group interaction .
conference calls try to match this interaction , but it is hard to speak in turn or to see one another &apos;s expressions when someone is talking .
conference calls have trouble replicating the intricacy of human conscious and unconscious group interactions that are critical to solve problems and accomplish tasks .
the amount of travel should then be related to the amount of know @-@ how that needs to be moved around .
countries differ in the amount of know @-@ how they possess , and industries differ in the amount of know @-@ how they require .
controlling for population and per capita income , travel is significantly more intense to and from countries and industries that possess or use more know @-@ how .
the countries that account for the most travel abroad , controlling for population , are all in Western Europe : Germany , Denmark , Belgium , Norway , and the Netherlands .
outside of Europe , the most travel @-@ intensive countries are Canada , Israel , Singapore , and the United States , a reflection of the fact that they need to deploy many brains to make use of their diverse know @-@ how .
interestingly , countries in the developing world differ substantially in the amount of know @-@ how they receive through business travel .
for example , countries such as South Africa , Bulgaria , Morocco , and Mauritius receive much more know @-@ how than countries at similar levels of development such as Peru , Colombia , Chile , Indonesia , or Sri Lanka .
the fact that firms incur the cost of business travel suggests that , for some key tasks , it is easier to move brains than it is to move the relevant information to the brains .
moreover , the fact that business travel is growing faster than the global economy suggests that output is becoming more intensive in know @-@ how and that know @-@ how is diffusing through brain mobility .
and , finally , the huge diversity of business travel intensity suggests that some countries are deploying or demanding much more know @-@ how than others .
rather than celebrate their thrift , countries that are out of the business travel loop should be worried .
they may be missing out on more than frequent flyer miles .
why Tuberculosis persists
San FRANCISCO - It surprises many people in Europe and North America that tuberculosis ( TB ) remains one of the great scourges in human history .
one out of every three people in the world is infected with latent or sub @-@ clinical TB , and scientists predict that 10 % of them will manifest the disease as age and other illnesses compromise their immune systems .
in 2015 , more than ten million new cases of TB were reported , and almost two million people died from it .
there are three reasons why TB persists : political leaders do not understand the sociology behind it , scientists lack an effective paradigm to attack it , and the rich and famous no longer die from it .
TB once affected every stratum of society , but it now afflicts the most vulnerable populations .
this makes it an ideal meme for artists and activists who focus on social justice .
the incidence of drug @-@ resistant TB is on the rise , because the health @-@ care systems of poor countries lack the resources to screen for TB and to help patients comply with their therapies .
six countries - India , Indonesia , China , Nigeria , Pakistan , and South Africa - account for 60 % of all reported TB cases .
Russia may be willfully underreporting its TB burden , and some African countries do not know how many of their citizens are infected .
political leaders have failed to understand the sociological factors behind TB .
for example , the disease &apos;s prevalence does not usually increase after natural disasters , but it did in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake , owing partly to the policies of the United Nations and USAID .
refugee camps were crowded , the sanitation was poor , children were chronically malnourished , and financial incentives caused many to extend their stay there .
TB afflicts many people who do not vote , such as refugees , prisoners , and the destitute .
prisons and slums also serve as breeding grounds for TB , and young women on the periphery of society can infect their children .
the World Health Organization states that TB @-@ infected mothers are &quot; associated with a six @-@ fold increase in perinatal deaths . &quot;
mother Teresa worked for decades with TB &apos;s victims in the slums of Calcutta , and observed that , &quot; The biggest disease today is not leprosy or tuberculosis , but rather the feeling of being unwanted . &quot;
discrimination , stigma , and isolation are not just pernicious features of weak societies ; they foster conditions that facilitate TB infections and increase the rate of diffusion .
partners in Health ( PIH ) , which runs TB clinics in South America , the Caribbean , and Africa , may be among those who get it right .
Peter Drobac , who ran their programs , told me that PIH trains people in small villages to identify the disease early and to administer treatment properly , as well as to build policy systems that focus on the underlying values of self @-@ determination and compassion , which strengthen any society .
innovation often comes from introducing insights and tools from a different domain .
maybe TB behaves more like cancer than like other infectious diseases .
Daryl Drummond - a vice president of Merrimack Pharmaceuticals and one of the innovators behind the only second @-@ line treatment for pancreatic cancer approved by the US Food and Drug Administration - told me that the lung lesions from a TB infection &quot; share a marked similarity with solid tumors . &quot;
in fact , he explained , &quot; the TB granuloma has many of the pathological features of cancer : hypoxia , a necrotic core , fibrous collagen at the outer rim , the development of a surrounding capillary network , and the presence of phagocytic cells . &quot;
if Drummond is right , those engaged in the fight against TB could look for ways in other branches of medicine to shorten treatment duration , lower dosing frequency , reduce side effects , lower costs , and improve compliance , all at the same time .
Drummond added , &quot; We are finding ways to achieve these things in oncology . &quot;
unfortunately , commercial innovation is slow to respond to TB .
as World Bank President and PIH co @-@ founder Jim Yong Kim points out , &quot; If you look at the three major killers - HIV , tuberculosis , and malaria - the only disease for which we have really good drugs is HIV .
the reason is simple : there &apos;s a market in the United States and Europe . &quot;
TB , by contrast , is often thought of as a &quot; third @-@ world &quot; or poor person &apos;s disease .
some of the most profitable and powerful pharmaceutical companies in the world , AstraZeneca and Pfizer , have left that &quot; market &quot; behind .
Tony Fauci , Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , which , since 1984 , has helped to lead successful global efforts against HIV and Zika , takes a different perspective .
&quot; collectively , &quot; he reminds us , &quot; we should be paying more attention to what is going on around us in the world among people who don &apos;t have the advantages that we have . &quot;
North Americans and Europeans need to lift their fingers out of &quot; the greasy till of commerce &quot; and see the end of TB as a challenge to our collective humanity .
it has certainly been a challenge to many of history &apos;s greatest artists and activists .
Henry David Thoreau , Eleanor Roosevelt , George Orwell , Franz Kafka , Louis braille , Wallace Thurman , and Simón Bolívar struggled with or against alienation , isolation , and injustice .
they all died of TB .
Nelson Mandela was diagnosed with TB while serving his 27 @-@ year prison term in a dank cell .
two liters of fluid were drained from his chest , and he recuperated in a hospital that had never treated a black patient .
if such eminent people contracted TB today , how fast could our governments and corporations find a cure ?
how many of the 400,000 children who die from TB each year could grow up , fight for social justice through art , activism , and commerce , and inspire the rest of us to do the same ?
why Turkey &apos;s Army Will Stay Home
just when the smoke from Turkey &apos;s domestic political conflicts of the past year had begun to clear , another deadly attack by Kurdish separatists on Turkish soldiers has the government threatening military attacks inside northern Iraq .
that prospect raises risks for Turkey , Iraq , and the United States .
but there are reasons to doubt that the situation is as dangerous as recent headlines suggest .
Turkey accuses Iraqi Kurds of harboring between 3,000 and 3,500 of Turkey &apos;s most active Kurdish militants - the PKK separatist guerillas who are blamed for the deaths of 80 Turkish soldiers so far this year .
the trouble reached the boiling point on October 7 , when Kurdish fighters killed 13 Turkish soldiers near Turkey &apos;s border with Iraq .
the Turkish public has demanded action , and Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s government has responded .
on October 17 , despite pleas for patience and restraint from Iraq and the US , Turkish lawmakers voted 507 @-@ 19 to authorize Erdogan to order cross @-@ border military strikes into Iraq at any time over the next year .
Erdogan has sent Iraqi Kurds a forceful message .
but , for several reasons , the Turkish military is likely to limit its operations to small @-@ scale incursions and air strikes on specific targets rather than launch an all @-@ out war .
first , the Turkish military has no interest in embracing the risks that come with involvement in Iraq &apos;s sectarian strife .
a full @-@ scale invasion might well provoke Iraq &apos;s own Kurdish guerrillas into a prolonged and bloody battle with Turkish forces that can only undermine support for Erdogan &apos;s government at home and abroad .
second , Turkey &apos;s government hopes to keep the country &apos;s bid to join the European Union moving forward .
an invasion of Iraq would bring that process to a grinding halt .
EU Foreign Policy chief Javier Solana has made plain that Europe strongly opposes any large @-@ scale Turkish military operation in Iraq .
third , Turkey is well aware that an all @-@ out attack inside Iraq is exactly what Turkey &apos;s Kurdish separatists want .
what better way to damage Turkey than to pull its military into conflict with Iraq , the US , and the EU ?
Erdogan has no intention of being drawn into that trap .
with all that in mind , this latest move by Turkey &apos;s parliament should be seen more as an ultimatum to Iraq &apos;s Kurdish Regional Government to expel the Turkish Kurds and an attempt to persuade the US to use its considerable influence there .
that &apos;s hardball politics , not a declaration of war .
the parliamentary authorization itself is carefully worded to underline Turkey &apos;s limited aims .
it stresses that Turkey &apos;s military has no intention of occupying Iraqi territory or threatening Iraqi Kurds or their oil infrastructure .
an attack would certainly make Iraq &apos;s Kurdish provinces less appealing for foreign investors .
but Turkey has no reason to attack the assets of foreign oil companies .
Iraq &apos;s central government is aware of the risks , as well , and is likely to exercise maximum restraint .
a limited Turkish strike into northern Iraq would probably elicit little reaction beyond public condemnation and rhetorical assertions of Iraqi sovereignty .
threats to Iraq &apos;s oil infrastructure around the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk and other territory under the Kurdish Regional Government &apos;s control are minimal .
Turkey &apos;s government knows that any move to shut down the 600 @-@ mile pipeline from Kirkuk to Turkey &apos;s Mediterranean port at Ceyhan would have little near @-@ term impact , since most of Iraq &apos;s oil exports flow from the south , hundreds of miles from the country &apos;s border with Turkey .
furthermore , the Turkish military can increase the pressure on Iraqi Kurds with far less drastic measures .
it can close the two countries &quot; principal border crossing , an important route for food , fuel , and other goods headed for Iraqi Kurds .
it could also cut exports of electricity to northern Iraq .
still , even small @-@ scale military operations would generate risk .
if the PKK is able to launch a major attack on troops or civilians inside Turkey , the public outcry might leave Erdogan with little choice but to up the ante .
the issue is complicated further by Turkey &apos;s refusal to negotiate directly with the Kurdish Regional Government in northern Iraq .
such talks , Turkey fears , would offer tacit acknowledgement that Iraqi Kurds have won a degree of autonomy from Baghdad .
that &apos;s a bridge too far for Turkey &apos;s nationalists and its military .
there are risks for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki as well , because Turkish military strikes on Iraq &apos;s northern provinces could undermine the Kurdish support on which his government increasingly depends .
both Sunni Arabs and Kurds already resent al Maliki &apos;s mild reaction to Iran &apos;s recent shelling of Iraqi territory - an attempt to strike at Iranian Kurdish militants fleeing across its border with Iraq .
there are also risks for the US .
most supplies headed for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan move through the Incirlik airbase in Turkey .
with the threat that the US House of Representatives will approve a resolution that accuses Turks of genocide against ethic Armenians nine decades ago , this is a particularly inopportune moment for the two countries to be at odds over Iraq .
but , worst @-@ case scenarios aside , a Turkish invasion of northern Iraq can only serve the interests of Turkey &apos;s Kurdish separatists .
that &apos;s why cooler heads are likely to prevail .
limited cross @-@ border operations are increasingly likely .
a war between Turkey and Iraqi Kurds is not .
why Ukraine Deserves a Haircut
London - In addition to its many other troubles , Ukraine now finds itself in a showdown with its creditors .
investors holding high @-@ yielding bonds - many of them bought at heavy discounts after Russia &apos;s annexation of Crimea last year - are demanding to be paid in full .
Ukraine &apos;s government , for its part , argues that the country &apos;s financial difficulties - in particular the economic effects of the conflict and the plunge in the value of the hryvnia - have made its debt burden unsustainable .
the outcome of this standoff could determine Ukraine &apos;s future , as much as the military confrontation with Russia .
recent developments have put the country on a path that would have been unimaginable until very recently .
for the first time in Ukraine &apos;s post @-@ Soviet history , it has a government that is willing and able to carry out real reform .
Ukraine &apos;s progress , however , could not be more fragile .
without some form of debt relief , it could easily be lost .
a little over a year ago , Ukraine did not have an elected president or a representative and functioning parliament .
the political landscape was deeply fragmented .
civil society had been energized by the Maidan revolution that ousted former President Viktor Yanukovych , but it was in turmoil .
debate over the association agreement with the European Union , along with the Russian @-@ backed rebellion in the east , had stoked tensions over distinctions that previously played little or no role in people &apos;s lives .
but since parliamentary elections in October , Ukraine has begun to pull itself together .
Russia &apos;s intervention has to some extent backfired , strengthening support for a European orientation .
Eastern Ukraine may have voted differently from the rest of the country , but the overwhelming majority of voters came out in favor of Europe .
the electorate also said no to the more virulent forms of nationalism , leaving the right @-@ wing extremist parties marginalized .
the result of the elections was the formation of a five @-@ party governing coalition .
though seemingly fragile , it has held up remarkably well .
some of its members have displayed worrying populist tendencies , but an analysis of parliamentary voting patterns indicates that so far the coalition has been able to find agreement , even on very difficult issues .
the government has , among other things , raised gas tariffs by 450 % ( from absurdly low levels ) .
dissension has been relatively moderate .
as a result , Ukraine &apos;s core institutions are undergoing fundamental change .
the central bank - once in the pocket of the country &apos;s oligarchs , supplying inside information on exchange rates and liquidity in exchange for bribes - has been put under the command of a governor committed to reform , surrounded by an increasingly professional team .
the energy monopoly Naftogaz , previously a cesspool of illicit transactions , has in a year managed the seemingly impossible : making Ukraine virtually independent from direct gas delivery from Russia for at least a year .
perhaps Ukraine &apos;s single most important achievement is the establishment of the National Reform Council .
originally set up to coordinate reforms across ministries and monitor their implementation , it has come to serve as an important tool to discuss and ensure coherence among the different branches of government .
this latter role is particularly important , given the constitutional ambiguity created by the reversion back to a parliamentary system and the uneasy co @-@ habitation of President Petro Poroshenko and Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk in government .
meetings are held every three weeks and are attended by the president , the prime minister , and his entire cabinet , providing a forum in which tensions can be discussed and eased .
in between meetings , the council &apos;s special project @-@ management office assists in the preparation and implementation of key reforms by ministries .
with support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the George Soros @-@ funded International Renaissance Foundation , and bilateral assistance from , among others , the Swedish government , the office has been able to hire staff at market rates , raising the quality of the government administration .
Ukraine &apos;s government has also benefited from the expertise of private @-@ sector leaders .
deputy Head of the Presidential Administration Dmytro Shymkiv , who drove the National Reform Council , was CEO of Microsoft Ukraine .
finance Minister Natalie Jaresko and Economic Development and Trade Minister Aivaras Abromavicius were both investment bankers ( neither was a Ukrainian citizen when they joined the government ) .
infrastructure Minister Andriy Pivovarsky , also a former investment banker , was most recently CEO of Continium , one of the country &apos;s largest holding companies .
each has played a key role in pushing the reform agenda forward , working for salaries that are orders of magnitude smaller than what they earned before .
some have even employed staff using their own money .
meanwhile , the ambitious agendas of the government ministers and the presidential administration are closely monitored by an energized civil society .
as Soros has noted , Ukraine probably has the most active civil society in Europe .
one of the country &apos;s most interesting new ventures is VoxUkraine , a blogging platform set up by two Ukrainian economics professors based in the United States , Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Timofiy Mylovanov .
they have championed modern evidence @-@ based decision @-@ making and constantly come up with new , constructive ways of challenging the government and its assumptions .
despite all this progress , however , the odds remain stacked against the country .
the government is fighting at least two wars simultaneously - taking on a deeply entrenched oligarchy , while trying to fend off its hostile eastern neighbor .
further trouble - in the form a steeply declining economy - is something it cannot afford .
the stakes could not be higher .
for the first time since the country gained its independence in 1992 , Ukraine has a clear sense of direction and a government capable of supporting reform .
there are signs that the oligarchs &quot; grip is beginning to loosen , owing partly to internal conflicts among them .
the EU and the US are working to help resolve its conflict with Russia .
Ukraine &apos;s private creditors must now do their part , recognize the country &apos;s economic and political situation , and accept a haircut on their bonds .
neither the Ukrainian economy - nor its political system - can afford that they do otherwise .
when Inflation Doves Cry
Pittsburgh - The Wall Street Journal recently ran a front @-@ page article reporting that the monetary @-@ policy &quot; doves , &quot; who had forecast low inflation in the United States , have gotten the better of the &quot; hawks , &quot; who argued that the Fed &apos;s monthly purchases of long @-@ term securities , or so @-@ called quantitative easing ( QE ) , would unleash faster price growth .
the report was correct but misleading , for it failed to mention why there is so little inflation in the US today .
were the doves right , or just lucky ?
the US Federal Reserve Board has pumped out trillions of dollars of reserves , but never have so many reserves produced so little monetary growth .
neither the hawks nor the doves ( nor anyone else ) expected that .
monetarists insist that economies experience inflation when money @-@ supply growth persistently exceeds output growth .
that has not happened yet , so inflation has been postponed .
instead of rejecting monetary theory and history , the army of Wall Street soothsayers should look beyond the Fed &apos;s press releases and ask themselves : does it make sense to throw out centuries of experience ?
are we really so confident that the Fed has found a new way ?
the Fed has printed new bank reserves with reckless abandon .
but almost all of the reserves sit idle on commercial banks &quot; balance sheets .
for the 12 months ending in July , the St. Louis Fed reports that bank reserves rose 31 % .
during the same period , a commonly used measure of monetary growth , M2 , increased by only 6.8 % .
no sound monetarist thinks those numbers predict current inflation .
indeed , almost all the reserves added in the second and third rounds of QE , more than 95 % , are sitting in excess reserves , neither lent nor borrowed and never used to increase money in circulation .
the Fed pays the banks 0.25 % to keep them idle .
with $ 2 trillion in excess reserves , and the prospect of as much as $ 85 billion added each month , banks receive $ 5 billion a year , and rising , without taking any risk .
for the bankers , that &apos;s a bonanza , paid from monies that the Fed would normally pay to the US Treasury .
and , adding insult to injury , about half the payment goes to branches of foreign banks .
in normal times , there are valid reasons for paying interest on excess reserves .
currently , however , it is downright counter @-@ productive .
Bank loans have started to increase , but small borrowers , new borrowers , and start @-@ up companies are regularly refused .
current low interest rates do not cover the risk that banks would take .
to be sure , they could raise the rate for new and small borrowers ; but , in the current political climate , they would stand accused of stifling economic recovery if they did .
the new Consumer Financial Protection Board is also a deterrent , as banks consider it safer to lend to the government , large corporations , and giant real @-@ estate speculators .
the banks can report record profits without much risk , rebuild capital , and pay dividends and bonuses .
and the Fed can congratulate itself on the mostly unobserved way that the large banks have used taxpayers &quot; money .
instead of continuing along this futile path , the Fed should end its open @-@ ended QE3 now .
it should stop paying interest on excess reserves until the US economy returns to a more normal footing .
most important , it should announce a strategy for eliminating the massive volume of such reserves .
I am puzzled , and frankly appalled , by the Fed &apos;s failure to explain how it will restore its balance sheet to a non @-@ inflationary level .
the announcements to date simply increase uncertainty without telling the public anything useful .
selling $ 2 trillion of reserves will take years .
it must do more than repeat that the Fed can raise interest rates paid on reserves to encourage banks to hold them .
it will take a clearly stated , widely understood strategy - the kind that Paul Volcker introduced in 1979 @-@ 1982 - to complete the job .
should the end of QE come in September , December , or later ?
does it matter ?
historically , the Fed has typically been slow to respond to inflation .
waiting until inflation is here , as some propose , is the usual way .
but that merely fuels inflation expectations and makes the task more painful .
and how high will the Fed push up interest rates ?
once rates get to 5 % or 6 % , assuming inflation remains dormant , the Fed can expect a backlash from Congress , the administration , unions , homebuilders , and others .
when contemplating the consequences of this , remember that 40 % of US government debt comes due within two years .
rolling it over at higher rates of 4 % or 5 % would add more than $ 100 billion to the budget deficit .
and that is just the first two years .
the budget cost increases every year , as more of the debt rolls over - and that does not include agency debt and the large increase in the current @-@ account deficit to pay China , Japan , and other foreign holders of US debt .
those who believe that inflation will remain low should look more thoroughly and think more clearly .
there are plenty of good textbooks that explain what too many policymakers and financial @-@ market participants would rather forget .
send in the Clowns
new YORK - When too many Italians voted late last month for either a louche and discredited business tycoon or a comedian , European stock markets plummeted .
with no public trust in the political class , Italy might become ungovernable .
but Italians are not alone .
rage against the political establishment has become a global phenomenon .
Chinese bloggers , American Tea Party activists , British Europhobes , Egyptian Islamists , Dutch populists , Greek ultra @-@ rightists , and Thai &quot; red shirts &quot; all have one thing in common : hatred of the status quo and contempt for their countries &quot; elites .
we are living in an age of populism .
the authority of conventional politicians and traditional media is slipping away fast .
populism can be a necessary corrective when political parties grow sclerotic , mass media become too complacent ( or too close to power ) , and bureaucracies are unresponsive to popular needs .
in a globalized world managed by bankers and technocrats , many people feel that they have no say in public affairs ; they feel abandoned .
our national politicians , increasingly powerless to cope with serious crises , are suspected , often with good reason , of simply looking after their own interests .
all we can do is vote the rascals out , sometimes by voting for candidates whom we would not take seriously in more normal times .
Italian elites are not the only ones in need of being shaken up .
but the problem with populism is that it is rarely benign . in the 1930 &quot; s , it resulted in violent movements led by dangerous men in uniform .
today &apos;s populists are different .
they do not , on the whole , advocate violence .
some preach that Muslims are destroying Western civilization .
others think that President Barack Obama is a kind of communist out to destroy America .
two types of contemporary populist , however , stand out : the ultra @-@ rich business tycoon and the clown .
in the Anglo @-@ Saxon media world , Rupert Murdoch , owner of far too many newspapers , TV stations , and movie studios , is a typical populist tycoon .
but he never aspired to lead a country .
former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra did - and still do .
neither the clown nor the tycoon is well suited to being a democratic leader .
the question is which is worse .
clowns have always played a role in politics .
medieval court jesters were often the only ones who could speak truth to despotic kings .
today , it is often comedians who claim to speak truth to power - and to the public .
in America , liberals turn for political commentary to television comedians like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert , who are now more trusted than traditional news broadcasters .
and clownish right @-@ wing radio talk @-@ show hosts now have more influence on many conservative American voters than the sober journalists of the mainstream media do .
a few years ago , a clown named Brozo , with a large red nose and a bright green wig , was Mexico &apos;s most popular political commentator on television , actively courted by all candidates running for national office .
in 1980 , the French clown Coluche actually dropped out of the presidential race when one newspaper put his popular support at 16 % , causing him to fear that he might influence the result too much .
the prototype of modern European populism was the flamboyant Dutch political showman Pim Fortuyn , who was assassinated in 2002 by a fanatical vegan .
Fortuyn &apos;s outrageousness was deliberately provocative and always entertaining .
his rants against the elites were often confused , but he was funny , which made the old elite politicians look like stuffy old bores - which many of them were .
and now Italy has Beppe Grillo , whose success in the country &apos;s recent election makes him the first professional comedian to lead a major political party in Europe .
the thing about clowns , though , is that few have any aspirations to rule their countries .
before his death , Fortuyn is said to have been terrified of the prospect of becoming Prime Minister .
and Grillo cannot even aspire to the job in Italy because of his criminal record .
clowns mostly seek to provoke , and this can be healthy .
they are less likely than members of the professional political class to allow political calculations to influence their views .
and , sometimes , they actually say things that are uncomfortable but true , and that need to be said .
political business tycoons , on the other hand , have different ambitions .
they attack the old elites not to shake things up , but to take their power .
promising to spread the riches that they have made for themselves , they exploit the fantasies of those of us who have little and want more .
Berlusconi understood the dreams of many Italians very well .
his extravagance , clownishness , and even his girls were part of his popular appeal .
in Thailand , the self @-@ made ethnic @-@ Chinese media billionaire Thaksin Shinawatra was especially admired by the rural poor .
like a beneficent king , he would give them money , and promised to challenge the old elites in Bangkok - the bankers , generals , judges , and even the courtiers surrounding the Thai king .
but tycoons are not natural democrats .
their main interest is in their own business .
and they do not hesitate to undermine an independent press or judiciary when their business interests are threatened .
even though his sister , Yingluck Shinawatra , is now in power , Thaksin is still trying to evade trial in Thai courts on a wide array of financial charges .
as it happens , Thaksin was overthrown in 2006 by a military coup that was largely backed by the Bangkok elites .
Berlusconi was replaced by a government run by elite technocrats , whose policies had to be approved by European bankers and European Union bureaucrats .
neither of these responses to populism is likely to boost democracy .
on the contrary , they make things worse .
what is needed is mainstream politicians who understand and respond to what is fueling popular rage .
paying attention to some of what the clowns are saying might be a good first step .
why Don &apos;t We Trust Our Leaders ?
Oxford - In developed democracies today , political leadership is increasingly up for grabs .
voters , clearly tired of the status quo , want change at the top , leaving even major parties &quot; establishments struggling to install leaders of their choosing .
in the United Kingdom , Labour Party MPs have been stymied in their efforts to unseat Jeremy Corbyn as leader .
in Japan , the ruling Liberal Democratic Party &apos;s preferred candidate for Governor of Tokyo , Hiroya Masuda , lost in a landslide to Yuriko Koike .
as for the United States , the Republican Party wanted virtually anybody except Donald Trump to win the nomination for the presidency ; yet Trump it is .
and while the Democratic Party is being represented by the establishment choice , Hillary Clinton , her competitor , Bernie Sanders , put up a much stronger fight than virtually anyone anticipated .
the message to the establishment is clear : we don &apos;t trust you anymore .
but some of the leaders voters do trust could pose a very real danger - to their supporters , their countries , and the world .
Trump - with his admiration of dictators , unabashed racism and sexism , ignorance regarding the issues , and mercurial temperament - stands at the top of this list .
those who led the British campaign to leave the European Union - such as Conservatives like Boris Johnson ( now the country &apos;s foreign secretary ) and Nigel Farage , the right @-@ wing populist leader of the UK Independence Party - are similarly disparaged for recklessly jeopardizing the future of the UK and the EU alike .
if mainstream leaders want to change voters &quot; minds , they should look carefully at what leadership really means .
here , it is worth recalling the insights of US General George C. Marshall , who contemplated the topic as he worked to rebuild the US military in the 1940s .
Marshall argued that leadership is a matter not of rhetoric , but of character .
in particular , leaders must display three key qualities to win the trust needed to lead effectively : purpose , impartiality , and competence .
purpose , in his view , meant putting the greater good ahead of one &apos;s own interests .
this kind of leadership still exists .
a shining example is Jo Cox , the young British MP who was murdered during the Brexit campaign , whose leadership in advocating for the rights of refugees was recognized across party lines .
but , in many cases , politics has become a matter of self @-@ promotion - and a race for ratings .
in today &apos;s celebrity culture , politicians must be &quot; personalities . &quot;
they campaign like contestants on a reality TV show .
Trump , with his clownish looks and showbiz resume , is probably the ultimate example of this shift .
( the Huffington Post even decided last summer to publish coverage of Trump &apos;s campaign in its entertainment section . )
the problem is not only that this can lead to the election of utterly unqualified leaders .
it is also that , once elected , even qualified leaders can struggle to shed the personal elements of their decision @-@ making , and serve the country impartially instead .
the slippery slope is exposed in a memo - recently disclosed as part of the UK &apos;s Chilcot Inquiry - written by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to former US President George W. Bush in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war .
the note begins , &quot; I will be with you , whatever . &quot;
he was talking about leading his country into war .
yet his language suggests that his personal bond with Bush somehow took precedence over his duty as Prime Minister .
leading with purpose , rather than personality , is closely related to the impartiality that Marshall thought essential .
once in office , leaders must act with fairness and candor .
they must resist the temptation to use official power to benefit themselves , their families , or their cultural identity group , and refuse enticements , however powerful they may be , to offer special access or protection to friends , funders , and lobbyists .
maintaining a high standard of impartiality is not easy , but it is far from impossible .
President Pedro Pires of Cape Verde was awarded the 2011 Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership , for transforming his country into &quot; a model of democracy , stability , and increased prosperity . &quot;
Pires retired from office without even a house to his name ; he worked for the people , not to amass personal wealth .
the third criterion for good leadership - competence - is not just a matter of how much knowledge a leader already possesses .
as Marshall noted , it also consists in leaders &quot; capacity to learn from their mistakes and to prepare themselves and those around them for important decisions .
Chilcot &apos;s verdict on Britain &apos;s lack of preparation for the Iraq War and its aftermath is damning in this regard .
so is the Brexiteers &quot; lack of any plan whatsoever for how to proceed after the referendum .
it is time to revitalize good leadership .
voters need to see candidates who show purpose , impartiality , and competence .
if they don &apos;t , they will continue to vote against the establishment that they believe has failed them - even if it means voting for turmoil in Europe or a reckless narcissist in the US .
the Battle for Water
new YORK - The sharpening international geopolitical competition over natural resources has turned some strategic resources into engines of power struggle .
transnational water resources have become an especially active source of competition and conflict , triggering a dam @-@ building race and prompting growing calls for the United Nations to recognize water as a key security concern .
water is different from other natural resources .
after all , there are substitutes for many resources , including oil , but none for water .
similarly , countries can import fossil fuels , mineral ores , and resources from the biosphere like fish and timber ; but they cannot import water , which is essentially local , on a large scale and on a prolonged - much less permanent - basis .
water is heavier than oil , making it very expensive to ship or transport across long distances even by pipeline ( which would require large , energy @-@ intensive pumps ) .
the paradox of water is that it sustains life but can also cause death when it becomes a carrier of deadly microbes or takes the form of a tsunami , flash flood , storm , or hurricane .
many of the greatest natural disasters of our time - including , for example , the Fukushima catastrophe in 2011 - have been water @-@ related .
global warming is set to put potable @-@ water supplies under increasing strain - even as oceans rise and the intensity and frequency of storms and other extreme weather events increase .
rapid economic and demographic expansion has already turned adequate access to potable water into a major issue across large parts of the world .
lifestyle changes , for example , have spurred increasing per capita water consumption , with rising incomes promoting dietary change , for example , especially higher consumption of meat , production of which is ten times more water @-@ intensive , on average , than plant @-@ based calories and proteins .
today , the earth &apos;s human population totals slightly more than seven billion , but the livestock population at any given time numbers more than 150 billion .
the direct ecological footprint of the livestock population is larger than that of the human population , with rapidly rising global meat consumption becoming a key driver of water stress by itself .
political and economic water wars are already being waged in several regions , reflected in dam construction on international rivers and coercive diplomacy or other means to prevent such works .
consider , for example , the silent water war triggered by Ethiopia &apos;s dam building on the Blue Nile , which has elicited Egyptian threats of covert or overt military reprisals .
a report reflecting the joint judgment of US intelligence agencies warned last year that the use of water as a weapon of war or a tool of terrorism would become more likely in the next decade in some regions .
the interaction Council , comprising more than 30 former heads of state or government , has called for urgent action to prevent some countries battling severe water shortages from becoming failed states .
the US State Department , for its part , has upgraded water to &quot; a central US foreign policy concern . &quot;
in many countries , inadequate local water availability is increasingly constraining decisions about where to set up new manufacturing facilities and energy plants .
the World Bank estimates that such constraints are costing China 2.3 % of GDP .
China , however , is not yet in the category of water @-@ stressed states .
those that are , stretching from South Korea and India to Egypt and Israel , are paying an even higher price for their water problems .
these countries already understand that water is a renewable but finite resource .
nature &apos;s water @-@ replenishment capacity is fixed , limiting the world &apos;s usable freshwater resources to about 200,000 cubic kilometers .
but the human population has almost doubled since 1970 , while the global economy has grown even faster .
major increases in water demand , however , are being driven not merely by economic and demographic growth , or by the additional energy , manufacturing , and food production to meet rising consumption levels , but also by the fact that the global population is getting fatter .
the average body mass index ( BMI ) of humans has been increasing in the post @-@ World War II period , but especially since the 1980 &quot; s , with the prevalence of obesity doubling in the past three decades .
heavier citizens make heavier demands on natural resources , especially water and energy .
the issue thus is not just about how many mouths there are to feed , but also how much excess body fat there is on the planet .
for example , a study published in the British journal BMC Public Health has found that if the rest of the world had the same average body mass index as the US , this would be the equivalent of adding almost one billion people to the global population , greatly exacerbating water stress .
with the era of cheap , bountiful water having been replaced by increasing supply and quality constraints , many investors are beginning to view water as the new oil .
the dramatic rise of the bottled @-@ water industry since the 1990 &quot; s attests to the increasing commodification of the world &apos;s most critical resource .
not only are water shortages likely to intensify and spread , but consumers also will increasingly have to pay more for their water supply .
this double whammy can be mitigated only by innovative water management and conservation , and by developing nontraditional supply sources .
as in the oil and gas sector - where tapping unconventional sources , such as shale and tar sands , has proved a game changer - the water sector must adopt all unconventional options , including recycling wastewater and desalinating ocean and brackish waters .
in short , we must focus on addressing our water @-@ supply problems as if our lives depended on it . in fact , they do .
the Biology of Luxury
Paris - Despite the global economic crisis , sales of luxury goods are surging worldwide .
why ?
while marketing has contributed to the rise , the luxury market &apos;s robust growth is actually rooted in biology .
discussions about the structure of human thought have long been dominated by the Enlightenment view that reality is composed of four elements : space , time , matter , and energy .
but recently , a fifth element , information , has entered the debate .
and information , it turns out , is crucial to understanding the fundamental drivers of luxury @-@ goods consumption , and thus to predicting the luxury market &apos;s future .
living organisms communicate , and the information that they exchange shapes their reality .
while animals use colorful displays and complicated behaviors to signal fitness and strength , humans use luxury goods to demonstrate economic health .
but , more than a symbol , buying luxury goods could indicate future success , owing to the selective advantage that showing off provides .
in nature , competitors perform , and the most compelling , beautiful spectacle wins .
for most animals , males are the performers .
male birds , for example , often have brightly colored plumage or intricate appendages , such as the Australian lyrebird &apos;s long tail .
as a result , competitive displays have been interpreted as a way to demonstrate fitness to a potential mate .
a bird that survives , despite inconvenient plumage that slows it down or makes it visible to predators , must be fit , and will likely sire a healthy progeny .
given that females bear the physical burden of offspring , an unobtrusive appearance is more advantageous - and thus more common - in nature .
but humans are social creatures with no natural predators , so female competition is more widespread - and demonstrative performance and display are more likely .
indeed , while visual manifestations of wealth are prevalent for both genders , women &apos;s appearance is frequently more vivid ( and more closely scrutinized ) .
but effective display is costly .
developing complex , vibrant plumage demands significant energy and genetic resources .
genes are difficult to maintain , requiring subtle and energy @-@ intensive correcting processes .
just as writing too fast can cause typographical errors that garble a text , rapid changes to the genome can undermine a species &quot; integrity .
likewise , purchasing luxury goods requires substantial financial resources .
this cost dictates the display &apos;s competitive impact .
in today &apos;s information @-@ based world , selection is effective only if a striking appearance is obtained at a very high price - and that price is known .
for example , those who use cosmetics known to be expensive often seem healthier , more vibrant , and more attractive than those who do not .
this is not the result of efficiency ( the most effective cosmetics frequently become pharmaceutical drugs ) .
rather , it signals a lifestyle that values the preservation of beauty and youth .
cosmetics , like all luxury products , gain influence not from their production , or even their purchase , but from their visibility .
indeed , an expensive item with no label or identifying characteristics has less competitive impact than a recognized item or brand .
for luxury goods to have any function , society needs information about their cost .
this has been true to varying degrees throughout history - sometimes resulting in price bubbles .
false information , such as counterfeit goods , jeopardizes the competition @-@ based selection process .
animals commonly use mimicry to capitalize on knowledge - or fear - of another &apos;s strength .
by imitating an animal with a well @-@ known protective profile , a weaker one may enjoy selective benefits without the costs .
but mimicry &apos;s success in nature depends on the ratio of the original to the ersatz .
if there are too few of the original , the profile loses its significance , and its protective value vanishes .
similarly , nobody would display a symbol of wealth if it were too common .
therefore , assessing whether luxury goods will maintain their impact , and thus their appeal , requires monitoring the extent of counterfeiting .
given that luxury goods provide individuals with a competitive advantage , higher luxury @-@ goods sales could indicate a brighter economic future for a country .
in a time of crisis , countries in which luxury goods play their selective role effectively are the safest bets for productive investment .
why Wolfensohn mattered
at the end of this month , James Wolfensohn &apos;s ten @-@ year tenure as President of the World Bank comes to an end .
though much remains to be accomplished and consolidated , his achievements as leader of the international development community are noteworthy and provide a strong foundation upon which to build .
perhaps Wolfensohn &apos;s most important contribution was to clarify the Bank &apos;s mission - to promote growth and eradicate poverty in the developing world - while recognizing the massive scale of that task and the inadequacy of previous approaches .
at one time , it was thought that since developing countries had less capital than more developed countries , merely supplying more capital would solve their problems .
indeed , this view provided part of the rationale for the World Bank : if a shortage of funds was the problem , clearly a Bank would have to be a key part of the solution .
in the 1980 &quot; s , there was a switch from projects to policies - structural adjustments , involving trade liberalization , privatization , and macroeconomic stabilization ( typically focusing on prices rather than employment or output . )
but these policies proved neither necessary nor sufficient for growth ; the countries of East Asia , which followed different policies , achieved faster growth and were far more successful in poverty reduction .
under Wolfensohn &apos;s leadership , the Bank began to look for multifaceted strategies , framed by what he called a Comprehensive Development Framework .
many of the links were obvious , but had been given insufficient attention .
improved rural productivity or better market access would do little good if roads and harbors were lacking .
in a malaria @-@ infested country , mosquito eradication programs can boost production and even increase effective land usage , as acres that were almost uninhabitable become livable .
the returns from education , too , can be increased , if more individuals live longer because of better health care .
the Bank began to recognize that developing countries differed from more developed countries not just in their lack of resources ; there was also a knowledge gap .
this was particularly important as the world moved into what we call the &quot; knowledge economy . &quot;
among the success stories were India and East Asia , which invested heavily not just in primary education , but also in secondary and tertiary education , and especially in technology and science .
this represented a major change in the Bank &apos;s approach to education , which previously focused on primary schooling .
Wolfensohn &apos;s campaign against corruption also represented a major change in thinking , a shift from downsizing the state to improving the State .
failed states , it was now acknowledged , were no less an impediment to development than were overbearing states .
the Bank &apos;s 1997 World Development Report reflected this new attempt at finding a balanced role for the state , and showed an understanding of the limitations both of markets and government .
under Wolfensohn , the Bank repeatedly stood up to the United States , where both the Clinton and Bush administrations might have preferred a more pliant President .
when then US Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers tried to change the Bank &apos;s decennial report on poverty - to downgrade concerns about insecurity and empowerment and to focus more narrowly on income - the Bank prevailed .
when the US tried to suppress the Bank &apos;s call for a more balanced intellectual property regime - one more consonant with the interests of developing countries - the Bank prevailed yet again .
both the Bush administration and the EU would undoubtedly have preferred less criticism of their trade regimes , which have such adverse effects on developing countries .
it would have been helpful for Bush if the World Bank quietly accepted proposals to finance debt relief for the poorest countries by depleting its reserves , thereby making poor countries pay for the poorest by reducing the Bank &apos;s lending capacity .
but it would have been wrong , and the Bank again stood up for the interests of the developing world .
changing the relationship between the Bank and the countries seeking its help was no less of an achievement .
in the past , the Bank was seen as a purveyor of neoliberal orthodoxy - an approach to development whose credibility had weakened by the time Wolfensohn arrived , and whose standing has eroded further since .
that orthodoxy often went hand in hand with the national , corporate , and financial interests of the advanced industrial countries , or so it was perceived .
worse , the Bank typically demanded myriad conditions in return for assistance , an approach that undermined democratic processes and domestic ownership of policies , thereby enervating their effectiveness .
when Bank research showed that conditionality did not work , the Bank under Wolfensohn moved away from it .
the Bank began to realize that on many key issues there were legitimate disagreements among economists about the right course of action .
democracy requires active debate about economic policies , not the suppression of discussion or the delegation of decision @-@ making to experts , whether domestic or foreign .
the Bank &apos;s attempt to open the debate was not well received , by either the US Treasury or the IMF , but its influence was undeniable .
the Fund , too , began to reduce conditionality , and eventually it began to question the desirability of capital market liberalization , which previously had been central to its agenda .
gradually the Bank came to be perceived , at least in many quarters , as a partner in the joint quest for growth and poverty reduction , not an adversary attempting to promote a Western economic agenda or ideology .
Wolfensohn meant it when he said that he wanted to put the country in the driver &apos;s seat , though not everyone within the Bank was as enthusiastic about this ( or some of his other ) initiatives .
James Wolfensohn presided over the World Bank at a time of enormous change , tumult , and opportunity , an era marked by the end of the Cold War , the postcommunist transition to market economies , and the East Asian - and then global - financial crises .
his commitment to those in the developing world has been contagious . he has left an impressive legacy for his successor to take up .
a virtuous Cycle for Conservation
new YORK - Poor and rural people around the world rely on plants and animals for shelter , food , income , and medicine .
in fact , the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal ( SDG 15 ) on sustainable ecosystems acknowledges many developing societies &quot; close relationship with nature when it calls for increased &quot; capacity of local communities to pursue sustainable livelihood opportunities . &quot;
but how is this to be achieved ?
the 1975 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) provides a viable framework for reducing poverty while also conserving nature .
it regulates the harvesting and exchange of more than 35,000 wildlife species across a range of locales .
nature has been described as the &quot; GDP of the poor . &quot;
the CITES framework , combined with strong national conservation policies , can simultaneously protect wild species and benefit poor , rural , and indigenous people , by encouraging countries and communities to adopt sound environmental management plans .
for example , under CITES , Andes communities shear the vicuña for its fine wool , which they sell to the luxury fashion industry in other parts of the world .
Cameroonians collect African cherry bark for export to European pharmaceutical companies .
and people on the Tibetan Plateau in Bhutan make a living selling Caterpillar fungus to the traditional @-@ medicine industry .
however , outside of CITES , limited guidance is available to ensure that legal trade is sustainable and beneficial to the poor .
sustainable trade often depends on poor and rural communities conserving their own resources at the local level .
to see what that looks like , the International Trade Center ( ITC ) recently examined how people in Southeast Asia sustainably manage the CITES @-@ listed python trade .
Python skins are commonly used as raw material in the luxury fashion industry , and ITC surveys of python @-@ skin harvesters , farmers , processors , and exporters in Vietnam and Malaysia found that the trade reinforces livelihood resilience by providing an additional source of income .
in Vietnam , an estimated 1,000 households farm and trade pythons , and python harvesting in Malaysia provides incomes for low @-@ skilled , low @-@ income workers during periods when other employment opportunities are either out of season , or simply scarce because of larger economic factors .
researchers found that most of those harvesting pythons implement simple and effective sustainable @-@ management plans , and that this has reduced pressure on wild populations .
however , python skins , like many wildlife products , are a commodity , so communities harvesting them are limited in terms of how they can add value to increase returns .
women in the Peruvian Andes may clean vicuña wool by hand to increase the price it fetches per kilogram by $ 50 , whereas selling a wool @-@ scarf could yield them $ 150 @-@ 200 ; a Malaysian python skin sells for $ 200 , while a python @-@ skin bag could sell for $ 2,000 .
still , some emerging countries are moving up the value chain and retaining a greater share of returns , as demonstrated by local brands such as Kuna , which markets alpaca and vicuña wool in Peru , and Natura , a Brazilian natural @-@ cosmetic brand .
the biggest threats to the legal wildlife trade are poaching , smuggling , improper trade permitting , and animal abuse , all of which must be addressed by regulators and rural community stakeholders at the local level .
fortunately , rural communities are already in the best position to protect wildlife , so long as they are motivated to do so .
in the right circumstances , a virtuous cycle , whereby local producers have a direct interest in protecting wildlife ( because they are benefiting from its legal trade ) is the best - and sometimes the only - long @-@ term solution to the problem of sustainability .
to help with this , governments can increase rural communities &quot; resource- and wildlife @-@ use rights so that they can manage and protect their natural resources sustainably .
for example , in the 1970s when Peru granted Andean communities the right to use vicuña wool , it saved the vicuña from extinction and created new , long @-@ term income streams for the community .
because legal and natural circumstances vary by country and community , we will need similar policy innovations across different sectors .
one promising sector is tourism , which also fits into the CITES framework .
to take one example , since Rwanda began sharing wildlife @-@ tourism revenues with local communities , the mountain @-@ gorilla population has grown .
as we see time and again , when local communities are included , they can become resolute wildlife defenders .
more generally , we should be supporting scientists working on new adaptive @-@ management methods , and the private sector should be given incentives to invest in greater sustainable sourcing and increased supply- and production @-@ chain transparency .
as the examples above show , conservation and improved livelihoods for the rural poor are feasible , and even mutually reinforcing .
with more political will and smart investments , there is no reason we can &apos;t reach the SDGs to both reduce poverty and safeguard wildlife for future generations .
last year , the UN passed an historic resolution to tackle illicit wildlife trafficking , recognizing the effectiveness of the CITES legal framework .
the resolution calls on the 182 CITES member countries to protect the interests of wildlife as well as to provide tangible benefits for the poor and rural communities .
we hope that delegates from those member countries meeting at the World Wildlife Conference in South Africa are hearing that call .
will Banks and Financial Markets Recover in 2009 ?
new YORK - Global financial markets in 2008 experienced their worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s .
major financial institutions went bust ; others were bought up on the cheap or survived only after major bailouts .
global stock markets fell by more than 50 % ; interest @-@ rate spreads skyrocketed ; a severe liquidity and credit crunch appeared ; and many emerging @-@ market economies staggered to the International Monetary Fund for help .
so what lies ahead in 2009 ?
is the worst behind us or ahead of us ?
to answer these questions , we must understand that a vicious circle of economic contraction and worsening financial conditions is underway .
the United States will certainly experience its worst recession in decades , a deep and protracted contraction lasting about 24 months through the end of 2009 .
moreover , the entire global economy will contract . there will be recession in the euro zone , the United Kingdom , Continental Europe , Canada , Japan , and the other advanced economies .
there is also a risk of a hard landing for emerging @-@ market economies , as trade , financial , and currency links transmit real and financial shocks to them .
in the advanced economies , recession had brought back earlier in 2008 fears of 1970 &quot; s @-@ style stagflation ( a combination of economic stagnation and inflation ) .
but , with aggregate demand falling below growing aggregate supply , slack goods markets will lead to lower inflation as firms &quot; pricing power is restrained .
likewise , rising unemployment will control labor costs and wage growth .
these factors , combined with sharply falling commodity prices , will cause inflation in advanced economies to ease toward the 1 % level , raising concerns about deflation , not stagflation .
deflation is dangerous as it leads to a liquidity trap : nominal policy rates cannot fall below zero , so monetary policy becomes ineffective .
falling prices mean that the real cost of capital is high and the real value of nominal debts rise , leading to further declines in consumption and investment - and thus setting in motion a vicious circle in which incomes and jobs are squeezed further , aggravating the fall in demand and prices .
as traditional monetary policy becomes ineffective , other unorthodox policies will continue to be used : policies to bail out investors , financial institutions , and borrowers ; massive provision of liquidity to banks in order to ease the credit crunch ; and even more radical actions to reduce long @-@ term interest rates on government bonds and narrow the spread between market rates and government bonds .
today &apos;s global crisis was triggered by the collapse of the US housing bubble , but it was not caused by it .
America &apos;s credit excesses were in residential mortgages , commercial mortgages , credit cards , auto loans , and student loans .
there was also excess in the securitized products that converted these debts into toxic financial derivatives ; in borrowing by local governments ; in financing for leveraged buyouts that should never have occurred ; in corporate bonds that will now suffer massive losses in a surge of defaults ; in the dangerous and unregulated credit default swap market .
moreover , these pathologies were not confined to the US .
there were housing bubbles in many other countries , fueled by excessive cheap lending that did not reflect underlying risks .
there was also a commodity bubble and a private equity and hedge funds bubble .
indeed , we now see the demise of the shadow banking system , the complex of non @-@ bank financial institutions that looked like banks as they borrowed short term and in liquid ways , leveraged a lot , and invested in longer term and illiquid ways .
as a result , the biggest asset and credit bubble in human history is now going bust , with overall credit losses likely to be close to a staggering $ 2 trillion .
thus , unless governments rapidly recapitalize financial institutions , the credit crunch will become even more severe as losses mount faster than recapitalization and banks are forced to contract credit and lending .
equity prices and other risky assets have fallen sharply from their peaks of late 2007 , but there are still significant downside risks .
an emerging consensus suggests that the prices of many risky assets - including equities - have fallen so much that we are at the bottom and a rapid recovery will occur .
but the worst is still ahead of us .
in the next few months , the macroeconomic news and earnings / profits reports from around the world will be much worse than expected , putting further downward pressure on prices of risky assets , because equity analysts are still deluding themselves that the economic contraction will be mild and short .
while the risk of a total systemic financial meltdown has been reduced by the actions of the G @-@ 7 and other economies to backstop their financial systems , severe vulnerabilities remain .
the credit crunch will get worse ; deleveraging will continue , as hedge funds and other leveraged players are forced to sell assets into illiquid and distressed markets , thus causing more price falls and driving more insolvent financial institutions out of business .
a few emerging @-@ market economies will certainly enter a full @-@ blown financial crisis .
so 2009 will be a painful year of global recession and further financial stresses , losses , and bankruptcies .
only aggressive , coordinated , and effective policy actions by advanced and emerging @-@ market countries can ensure that the global economy recovers in 2010 , rather than entering a more protracted period of economic stagnation .
Europe &apos;s unending Berlusconi Problem
London - Silvio Berlusconi , Italy &apos;s three @-@ time prime minister and the country &apos;s dominant politician for two decades , has now been convicted and sentenced to four years in prison - a sentence since reduced to one year . but few people in Italy - or in Europe - believe that Berlusconi will fade from Italian , or European , politics anytime soon .
just a few days ago , he declared his intention to remain involved in politics , though not to run for prime minister a fourth time .
whatever role Berlusconi chooses to play , it is unlikely to be a marginal one .
he may not wish to be king again , but he certainly can be a kingmaker , owing to his control of MediaSet , Italy &apos;s largest media group .
and , given his abysmal popularity ratings , he may decide to play the wild card , embrace a euro @-@ skeptic and anti @-@ government stance , and try to bring down Prime Minister Mario Monti &apos;s technocratic administration .
Monti &apos;s government took over from Berlusconi in November 2011 , arriving with a clear mandate , and full parliamentary support , to implement the measures needed to restore market confidence and reassure Italy &apos;s eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund that the country was not going down the path taken by Greece .
at the time of the G @-@ 20 summit in Cannes that month , Italy - and Europe - was dangerously close to collapse , with Berlusconi &apos;s government deeply divided about the fiscal measures needed to bring down the country &apos;s debt @-@ service costs .
domestic political deadlock , and Berlusconi &apos;s inability to engage with Germany and France resulted in spiraling refinancing costs , with the spread relative to German bunds consistently over 500 basis points between July and November 2011 .
the Monti government has restored market confidence and Italy &apos;s international credibility .
but the overall picture remains fragile .
the interest @-@ rate spread has stabilized around a more manageable 300 basis points , but is still higher than it was three years ago .
in addition , Italy &apos;s economic outlook remains highly uncertain .
indeed , the modest economic recovery that should benefit many countries in 2013 seems to be eluding Italy .
according to the IMF , the economy will remain in recession next year , and , though the rate of contraction will be less severe than in 2012 ( -0.7 % in 2013 , compared to -2.3 % this year ) , the unemployment rate is expected to rise further , from 10.6 % to 11.1 % .
more needs to be done in order to support economic growth in the short term , improve the country &apos;s fiscal position in the medium term , and implement the structural reforms needed to make the Italian economy more robust and internationally competitive in the long term .
Italy is ranked 43rd in the World Economic Forum &apos;s global competitiveness index , well below the main eurozone countries , owing to lack of investment - especially in human capital - and structural rigidities that have constrained growth for many years .
the answer to Italy &apos;s economic problems is not , as Berlusconi advocates , an exit from the eurozone and a return to the flexibility of its own currency , which in the past allowed policymakers to boost competitiveness through irresponsible devaluations .
Italy needs to learn how to live with the euro and within the eurozone , which means adopting policies that ensure that productivity growth and innovation , not currency devaluation , are the main drivers of competitiveness .
a stable , competent , and responsible government with a comfortable parliamentary majority is essential to continue what Monti &apos;s government has initiated .
while the odds still favor a relatively smooth transition , many uncertainties could derail the reform process .
in particular , whether Italy will be able to move beyond technocratic politics to a &quot; normal &quot; government remains the outstanding question both at home and for the other eurozone member states .
from this perspective , what Berlusconi advocates for Italy , and the consequences of his agenda for the eurozone , is not good news .
any hint that the country may be locked again in parliamentary inertia , as in the final months of Berlusconi &apos;s last government , would push the markets to question the credibility of Italy &apos;s fiscal @-@ consolidation plan , jeopardizing the country &apos;s ability to refinance its debt .
that debt is the largest in the eurozone - at roughly € 2 trillion ( $ 2.6 trillion ) , or 120 % of the country &apos;s GDP - which means that Italy can be helped , but not rescued .
with potential instability looming , Monti should ensure that Italy is not defenseless in the event of another round of market instability .
unlike some months ago , now the European Central Bank can intervene and buy troubled countries &quot; debt .
but this mechanism can be activated only by formal request .
Italy should follow this route without delay .
it is better to have a powerful weapon that may gather dust than to be unarmed in a time of need .
will Britain Choose irrelevance ?
London - When voters in the United Kingdom go to the polls on June 23 to decide whether their country should leave the European Union , the issues they will have to reckon with will include the impact of their decision on unemployment , trade flows , and the stability of financial markets .
but there are other less quantifiable considerations that must also be weighed in the balance .
the economic arguments against a British exit from the EU - or Brexit - have been well rehearsed .
many have suggested that if the UK were to leave , manufacturers would secure continued access to the European market by fleeing across the English Channel , costing the country millions of jobs .
similarly , withdrawal from the EU risks undermining London &apos;s position as a global financial center , which depends on the city &apos;s integration into European markets .
trade agreements , too , would have to be renegotiated in the wake of a Brexit .
another area of concern for many voters regards the UK &apos;s sovereignty - the idea that independent countries should have ultimate decision @-@ making authority over what happens within their borders .
membership in the EU sometimes requires ceding control to a complex web of often @-@ inefficient Brussels @-@ based supranational institutions .
I hold a doctorate in economics and work with businesses whose employees and operations benefit from the UK &apos;s membership in the EU .
I also have a pronounced disdain for red tape and inefficiency .
and yet I do not believe that economic considerations or concerns about sovereignty offer compelling arguments for Brexit .
much more important is the potential impact of such a decision on the UK &apos;s global standing .
membership in a European community of 500 million people provides the UK with considerable influence over geopolitics and the global economy .
as the world becomes ever more daunting and complex , maintaining that influence is clearly in the country &apos;s interest .
the referendum campaign is playing out against a global economic and political backdrop that is nothing if not foreboding .
the International Monetary Fund has warned that global growth is unlikely to return to the levels that it attained before the 2008 financial crisis .
indeed , the global consulting firm McKinsey predicts that global growth rates during the next 50 years will be half of what they were over the previous five decades .
meanwhile , Martin Dempsey , a retired army general and former Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff , has said that the world has entered the most dangerous period he has ever witnessed .
developing countries are home to roughly 90 % of the world &apos;s population , and some two @-@ thirds of their residents are younger than 25 .
stagnant growth or shrinking output in many emerging economies has serious consequences .
the UK &apos;s Overseas Development Institute predicts that by 2025 , roughly 80 % of the world &apos;s poor will live in fragile states .
job @-@ eroding technological advances , worsening income inequality , demographic shifts , dwindling natural resources , and environmental depletion are adding even more straws to the camel &apos;s back .
the world is already undergoing the worst refugee crisis since the end of World War II , with some 60 million people having been driven from their homes .
the mounting instability will only exacerbate the problem .
leaving the EU will not shield the UK from the vagaries of the global economy .
it will only deprive the country of a leading voice in shaping the response to new and existing challenges .
the UK is far better placed to influence the global policy agenda from inside the EU than from outside it .
to be sure , leaving the EU would not strip the UK of its historical prominence in international organizations - most notably its permanent membership of the United Nations &quot; Security Council .
but a non @-@ European Britain would be less likely to secure the same standing and influence in whatever institutions emerge in the years ahead .
within the EU , the UK is a critical part of an influential economic and political bloc with undeniable heft .
amplified by the EU , its voice can influence world events , providing the country with what the British like to describe as an ability to punch above its weight .
should the UK leave , however , its influence would be limited to its true size on the global stage : a relatively small country with limited economic and political power .
as British voters prepare to cast their ballots , they should weigh carefully the consequences of international irrelevance .
will Cap @-@ and @-@ Trade incite Protectionism ?
Cambridge ­ - There is a serious danger that the international adoption of cap @-@ and @-@ trade legislation to limit carbon @-@ dioxide emissions will trigger a new round of protectionist measures .
while aimed at reducing long @-@ term environmental damage , cap @-@ and @-@ trade policies could produce significant harmful economic effects in the near term that would continue into the future .
scientific evidence appears to indicate that the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels ( primarily coal , oil , and natural gas ) - mainly in electricity production , transportation , and various industrial processes - contributes to gradual global warming , with long @-@ term adverse effects on living conditions around the world .
it is with this in mind that representatives of more than 150 countries are scheduled to meet in Copenhagen in December to discuss ways to reduce CO2 emissions .
a common suggestion is to impose a tax on all CO2 emissions , which would be levied on companies that emit CO2 in production , or that sell products like gasoline that cause CO2 emissions when used .
such a tax would cause electricity companies and industrial firms to adopt techniques that reduce their CO2 emissions , as long as the cost of doing so is less than the tax that they would otherwise have to pay .
the higher cost of production incurred to reduce emissions - and of any emissions tax still due - would , of course , be included in the price charged to consumers .
consumers would respond to the tax @-@ induced increase in the cost of the emissions @-@ intensive products by reducing their consumption of those goods and services in favor of goods and services that create smaller amounts of CO2 emissions .
a carbon tax causes each firm and household to respond to the same cost of adding CO2 to the atmosphere .
that uniform individual cost incentive allows total CO2 to be reduced at a lower total cost than would be achieved by a variety of administrative requirements , such as automobile mileage standards , production technology standards ( e.g. , minimum renewable fuel inputs in electricity generation ) , etc .
yet we do not see carbon taxes being adopted .
although governments levy taxes on gasoline , they are reluctant to impose a general carbon tax because of public opposition to any form of taxation .
governments have therefore focused on a cap @-@ and @-@ trade system as a way of increasing the cost of CO2 @-@ intensive products without explicitly imposing a tax .
in a cap @-@ and @-@ trade system , the government sets total allowable national emissions of CO2 per year and requires any firm that causes CO2 emissions to have a permit per ton of CO2 emitted .
if the government sells these permits in an auction , the price of the permit would be a cost to the firm in the same way as a carbon tax - and with the same resulting increases in consumer prices .
the cap @-@ and @-@ trade system thus imposes a carbon tax without having to admit that it is really a tax .
a cap @-@ and @-@ trade system can cause serious risks to international trade .
even if every country has a cap @-@ and @-@ trade system and all aim at the same relative reduction in national CO2 emissions , the resulting permit prices will differ because of national differences in initial CO2 levels and in domestic production characteristics .
because the price of the CO2 permits in a country is reflected in the prices of its products , the cap @-@ and @-@ trade system affects its international competitiveness .
when the permit prices become large enough to have a significant effect on CO2 emissions , there will be political pressure to introduce tariffs on imports that offset the advantage of countries with low permit prices .
such offsetting tariffs would have to differ among products ( being higher on more CO2 @-@ intensive products ) and among countries ( being higher for countries with low permit prices ) .
such a system of complex differential tariffs is just the kind of protectionism that governments have been working to eliminate since the start of the GATT process more than 50 years ago .
worse still , cap @-@ and @-@ trade systems in practice do not rely solely on auctions to distribute the emissions permits .
the plan working its way through the United States Congress ( the Waxman @-@ Markey bill ) would initially give away 85 % of the permits , impose a complex set of regulatory policies , and allow companies to buy CO2 offsets ( e.g. , by paying for the planting of trees ) instead of reducing their emissions or buying permits .
such complexities make it impossible to compare the impact of CO2 policies among countries , which in turn would invite those who want to protect domestic jobs to argue for higher tariff levels .
there is no easy answer to this problem .
but before rushing to impose tariffs , it is important to remember that cap @-@ and @-@ trade policies would not be the only government source of differences in competitiveness .
better roads , ports , and even schools all contribute to a country &apos;s competitiveness .
no one attempts to use tariffs to balance those government @-@ created differences in competitiveness , and there should be no such attempts if a cap @-@ and @-@ trade system is introduced .
if an international agreement to impose a cap @-@ and @-@ trade scheme is adopted in Copenhagen , the countries there should agree as well that there will be no attempt to introduce offsetting tariffs that would ultimately threaten our global system of free trade .
will China &quot; Lose &quot; the 2008 Olympics ?
when the International Olympic Committee awarded Beijing the 2008 Summer Games in July 2001 , the announcement ignited wild celebrations across the country .
the Chinese Communist Party hoped to use the Games to showcase the country &apos;s emergence as a dynamic , modern nation .
but as China &apos;s leaders begin final preparations for the Games next August , they may be wondering if hosting the event was such a good idea after all .
they have significant reasons for doubt .
China &apos;s senior leaders always closely monitor spontaneous public expressions of nationalist fervor , fearful that shifting winds might blow an unwelcome storm in their direction .
of course what they hope is that the Games will channel these energies toward national solidarity , which will allow the leadership to deliver its people a moment of achievement and patriotic glory .
but the Olympics will also bring intense international scrutiny of China &apos;s weaknesses at a delicate moment in the country &apos;s development .
the world already knows of China &apos;s success and its attractiveness as a destination for foreign investment , but few outsiders have seen firsthand the steep price the country is paying for its new prosperity .
the most obvious signs of that cost flow through the country &apos;s waterways and contaminate its air .
runaway growth and development have left about 70 % of China &apos;s lakes and rivers severely polluted , many unfit for human use of any kind .
indeed , nearly a half @-@ billion Chinese lack access to clean drinking water , and the number of terminally polluted rivers and lakes grows daily .
but air quality will prove the more embarrassing problem next August .
television coverage of athletes gasping for breath will hardly provide Beijing with the signature Olympic image it had in mind , and growing international anxiety over climate change and other environmental hazards will ensure that such issues receive considerable media coverage .
there is also the risk that the Games will become a political circus , as the international spotlight generates irresistible opportunities for public protest .
the Chinese leadership has demonstrated many times that it can quell domestic dissent , but the unique scale of the Olympics will require round @-@ the @-@ clock vigilance .
activists with grievances over Tibet , Taiwan , Burma , Darfur , and dozens of other political , environmental , and human @-@ rights issues are already making plans .
is China ready for Greenpeace , Human Rights in China , Amnesty International , and Falun Gong supporters to take to the streets , with thousands of foreign journalists hungry for stories and asking questions that the authorities are unaccustomed to answering ?
even if police are able to maintain order in Beijing , can they extend that control across the country ?
can they manage the flow of information and ideas through the blogosphere as online activists open yet another front in their battle for free information ?
what we do know that Chinese officials have never faced a challenge of this scale with such a potential to both win and lose face .
the Games will generate significant foreign @-@ policy risks as well .
in Taiwan , outgoing President Chen Shui @-@ bian is stirring the independence pot , knowing that the Olympic spotlight will limit Beijing &apos;s ability to respond forcefully .
he has already proposed a popular referendum on Taiwanese membership in the United Nations .
China &apos;s influence within the UN would prevent such a move even if Taiwan voted yes , but an international confrontation is the last thing China wants coinciding with the Olympics .
then there is the matter of how the Games will be received in the West .
since 2001 , China has increasingly become the focal point of much anxiety in the developed world .
huge bilateral trade deficits , accusations that China keeps its currency undervalued , and a rash of defective and dangerous Chinese @-@ made exports have fueled a protectionist backlash in the United States and Europe .
amid bitter election @-@ year debates over Iraq and Iran , and a souring economic outlook , Americans may be in no mood for the triumphalist pageantry of a new rising power on display in Beijing .
will China &apos;s uneasy Asian neighbors be any more receptive ?
international criticism is sure to follow if something , anything , goes wrong during the Games , especially if it involves the suppression of dissent and is vectored around the world via 24 @-@ hour cable television and the Internet .
China has changed since it &quot; won &quot; the 2008 games seven years ago .
the Party leadership has grown more self @-@ assured in its growing international role , but its ability to manage the pace of change at home has become more uncertain .
in 2001 , then President Jiang Zemin hoped the Games would herald China &apos;s arrival as an industrialized power .
but his successor , Hu Jintao , has focused on the damage that has come from unrestrained growth .
he and Premier Wen Jiabao have also championed a more &quot; harmonious &quot; society , because they understand that the growing wealth gap , social tensions , environmental and public health problems , and the Party &apos;s tenuous relationship with China &apos;s less advantaged people can no longer be neglected .
as China &apos;s leaders scramble to address these challenges , will they still relish the idea of providing an international audience with front @-@ row seats ?
how they look back on the Games once the confetti is swept from the streets is far from certain .
will China &apos;s Capitalist Revolution Turn Democratic
Communist China has experienced a monumental capitalist revolution in the last two decades , with an economy that is now six times bigger than it was 20 years ago .
a minor player in the global economy in the 1980 &quot; s , China today is the world &apos;s third largest trading power .
but if these stunning economic statistics make you think that so much capitalist development must also have brought more democracy to China , think again .
most Westerners believe in a theory of liberal evolution , according to which sustained economic growth , by increasing wealth and the size of the middle class , gradually makes a country more democratic .
while the long @-@ run record of this theory is irrefutable , China &apos;s authoritarian ruling elite is not only determined to hold on to power , but it also has been smart enough to take adaptive measures aimed at countering the liberalizing effects of economic development .
thus , for all its awe @-@ inspiring economic achievement , China has made remarkably little progress in political liberalization .
indeed , judging by several key indicators , progress toward democracy in China has stalled , despite unprecedented economic prosperity and personal freedom .
for instance , in the mid @-@ 1980 &quot; s , Chinese leaders seriously discussed and later drew up a blueprint for modest democratic reforms .
today , the topic of political reform is taboo .
nearly all the major institutional reforms , such as strengthening the legislature , holding village elections , and building a modern legal system , were launched in the 1980 &quot; s .
since the Tiananmen Square massacre of June 1989 , however , not a single major democratic reform initiative has been implemented .
instead of democratic transition , China has witnessed a consolidation of authoritarian rule - the strengthening of a one @-@ party regime through organizational learning and adaptation .
since 1989 , the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) has been pursuing a two @-@ pronged strategy : selective repression that targets organized political opposition and co @-@ optation of new social elites ( the intelligentsia , professionals , and private entrepreneurs ) .
this strategy emphasizes the maintenance of an extensive law enforcement apparatus designed to eliminate any incipient organized opposition .
huge investments have strengthened the People &apos;s Armed Police ( PAP ) , a large anti @-@ riot paramilitary force whose specialty is the quick suppression of anti @-@ government protests by disgruntled industrial workers , peasants , and urban residents .
frequent deployment of the PAP is a major reason why the tens of thousands of collective protests that occur each year ( 74,000 in 2004 and 86,000 in 2005 ) have had a negligible impact on China &apos;s overall stability .
to deal with new emerging political threats , such as the information revolution , the Chinese government has spent mightily on manpower and technology .
a special 30,000 @-@ strong police unit monitors and screens Internet traffic , advanced technology is deployed to block access to overseas Web sites considered &quot; hostile or harmful , &quot; and Internet service and content providers , both domestic and Western , must comply with onerous restrictions designed to suppress political dissent and track down offenders .
the regime has even conducted multi @-@ agency exercises to test whether different government bodies could cooperate closely to keep &quot; harmful information &quot; off the Net during an emergency .
having learned from the collapse of the Soviet Union that a bureaucratic ruling party must co @-@ opt new social elites to deprive potential opposition groups of leaders , the Communist Party has conducted an effective campaign of expanding its social base .
the urban intelligentsia and professionals have been pampered with material perks and political recognition , while new private entrepreneurs have been allowed to join the Party .
this strategy of pre @-@ emptive political decapitation has produced enormous dividends for the Party .
in the 1980 &quot; s , its principal adversaries were the urban intelligentsia , who constituted the backbone of the pro @-@ democracy movement that culminated in Tiananmen Square .
today , the mainstream of the Chinese intelligentsia is an integral part of the ruling elite .
many have joined the Party and become government officials , and a large percentage enjoy various professional and financial privileges .
predictably , the intelligentsia , usually the most liberal social group , is no longer a lethal threat to party rule .
worse , without support from this strategic group , other social groups , such as workers and peasants , have become politically marginalized and rudderless .
although the Party &apos;s carrot @-@ and @-@ stick approach has worked since 1989 , it is doubtful that it will retain its efficacy for another 17 years .
to the extent that China &apos;s authoritarian regime is by nature exclusionary ( it can only incorporate a limited number of elites ) , the co @-@ optation strategy will soon run up against its limits , and the Party will no longer have the resources to buy off the intelligentsia or keep private entrepreneurs happy .
at the same time , selective repression can contain social frustrations and discontent only temporarily .
as long as much of Chinese society views the current political system as unjust , unresponsive , and corrupt , there will always be a large reservoir of ill will toward the ruling elites .
when things go wrong - as is likely , given mounting social strains caused by rising inequality , environmental degradation , and deteriorating public services - China &apos;s alienated masses could become politically radicalized .
and , unlike past protests , which have usually been allied with students or members of the intelligentsia , popular disaffection might not have the virtue of rational leaders with whom the government could talk and negotiate .
so it may be premature for the Party to celebrate the success of its adaptive strategy .
China &apos;s rulers may have stalled democratic trends for now , but the current strategy has , perhaps , merely delayed the inevitable .
the Mirage of the Financial Singularity
new HAVEN - In their new book The Incredible Shrinking Alpha , Larry E. Swedroe and Andrew L. Berkin describe an investment environment populated by increasingly sophisticated analysts who rely on big data , powerful computers , and scholarly research .
with all this competition , &quot; the hurdles to achieving alpha &#91; returns above a risk @-@ adjusted benchmark - and thus a measure of success in picking individual investments &#93; are getting higher and higher . &quot;
that conclusion raises a key question : will alpha eventually go to zero for every imaginable investment strategy ?
more fundamentally , is the day approaching when , thanks to so many smart people and smarter computers , financial markets really do become perfect , and we can just sit back , relax , and assume that all assets are priced correctly ?
this imagined state of affairs might be called the financial singularity , analogous to the hypothetical future technological singularity , when computers replace human intelligence .
the financial singularity implies that all investment decisions would be better left to a computer program , because the experts with their algorithms have figured out what drives market outcomes and reduced it to a seamless system .
many believe that we are almost there .
even legendary investors like Warren Buffett , it is argued , are not really outperforming the market .
in a recent paper , &quot; Buffett &apos;s Alpha , &quot; Andrea Frazzini and David Kabiller of AQR Capital Management and Lasse Pedersen of Copenhagen Business School , conclude that Buffett is not generating significantly positive alpha if one takes account of certain lesser @-@ known risk factors that have weighed heavily in his portfolio . the implication is that Buffet &apos;s genius could be replicated by a computer program that incorporates these factors .
if that were true , investors would abandon , en masse , their efforts to ferret out mispricing in the market , because there wouldn &apos;t be any .
market participants would rationally assume that every stock price is the true expected present value of future cash flows , with the appropriate rate of discount , and that those cash flows reflect fundamentals that everyone understands the same way .
investors &quot; decisions would diverge only because of differences in their personal situation .
for example , an automotive engineer might not buy automotive stocks - and might even short them - as a way to hedge the risk to his or her own particular type of human capital .
indeed , according to a computer crunching big data , this would be an optimal decision .
there is a long @-@ recognized problem with such perfect markets : no one would want to expend any effort to figure out what oscillations in prices mean for the future .
Thirty @-@ five years ago , in their classic paper , &quot; On the impossibility of Informationally Efficient Markets , &quot; Sanford Grossman and Joseph Stiglitz presented this problem as a paradox : perfectly efficient markets require the effort of smart money to make them so ; but if markets were perfect , smart money would give up trying .
the Grossman @-@ Stiglitz conundrum seems less compelling in the financial singularity if we can imagine that computers direct all the investment decisions .
although alpha may be vanishingly small , it still represents enough profit to keep the computers running .
but the real problem with this vision of financial singularity is not the Grossman @-@ Stiglitz conundrum ; it is that real @-@ world markets are nowhere close to it .
computer enthusiasts are excited by things like the blockchain used by Bitcoin ( covered on an education website called Singularity University , in a section dramatically titled Exponential Finance ) .
but the futurists &quot; financial world bears no resemblance to today &apos;s financial world .
after all , the financial singularity implies that all prices would be based on such things as optimally projected future corporate profits and the correlation of profits with expected technological innovations and long @-@ term demographic changes .
but the smart money hardly ever talks in such ethereal terms .
in this context , it is difficult not to think of China &apos;s recent stock @-@ market plunge .
news accounts depict hordes of emotional people trading on hunch and superstition .
that looks a lot more like reality than all the talk of impending financial singularity .
markets seem to be driven by stories , as I emphasize in my book Irrational Exuberance . there are stories of great new eras and of looming depressions .
there are fundamental stories about technology and declining resources .
and there are stories about politics and bizarre conspiracies .
no one knows if these stories are true , but they take on a life of their own .
sometimes they go viral .
when one has a heart @-@ to @-@ heart talk with many seemingly rational people , they turn out to have crazy theories .
these people influence markets , because all other investors must reckon with them ; and their craziness is not going away anytime soon .
maybe Buffett &apos;s past investing style can be captured in a trading algorithm today .
but that does not necessarily detract from his genius .
indeed , the true source of his success may consist in his understanding of when to abandon one method and devise another .
the idea of financial singularity may seem inspiring ; but it is no less illusory than the rational Utopia that inspired generations of central planners .
human judgment , good and bad , will drive investment decisions and financial @-@ market outcomes for the rest of our lives and beyond .
are Emerging Markets the Canary in the Financial Coal Mine ?
Buenos AIRES - Are brewing exchange @-@ rate and debt crises in Argentina and Turkey localized events without broader implications ?
or are they early warning signs of deeper fragilities in bloated global debt markets that are being exposed as the US Federal Reserve continues to normalize interest rates ?
rising interest rates could test stability in some advanced economies as well , especially in Italy , where voters , particularly in the less developed south , have opted decisively for a disruptive populist government .
with an economy ten times the size of Greece , a default in Italy would blow up the eurozone .
indeed , the populist coalition government that has now taken power has hinted that it wants write @-@ offs for some of its under @-@ the @-@ table debts ( not included in Italy &apos;s official public debt of over 130 % of GDP ) to the euro system through the European Central Bank .
the good news is that a full @-@ blown global debt crisis is still relatively unlikely to erupt .
even with a recent softening of European performance , the overall global economic picture remains strong , with most regions of the world still growing briskly .
although it is true that several emerging @-@ market firms have piled up worrisome quantities of dollar @-@ denominated external debt , many foreign central banks are brimming with dollar assets , especially in Asia .
the International Monetary Fund , moreover , has sufficient resources to handle a first wave of crises , even if it includes , say , Brazil .
the main concern is not that the IMF will fail to deliver funds , but that it will make the same mistake it did in Greece , by not imposing a realistic deal on debtors and creditors .
as for Italy , chances are that Europe will find a way to grant temporarily some of the extra budget slack the new government seeks , even if there is no way eurozone officials can allow high @-@ debt Italy simply to destroy the common currency .
the most important reason for optimism , notwithstanding all the surrounding political noise , is that global long @-@ term real interest rates are still extremely low .
even with all the drama surrounding Fed tightening , 30 @-@ year inflation @-@ indexed Treasury bills are paying around 1 % - far below long @-@ term real returns , which have averaged closer to 3 % .
as long as the underlying global interest @-@ rate picture is so benign , it is hard to see the big Kahuna of bond @-@ default waves coming just yet .
it is notable how much the IMF , the world &apos;s debt and financial crisis watchdog , has been ratcheting up its warnings .
after years of saying advanced countries no longer need to worry about their near @-@ record public @-@ debt levels - now averaging over 100 % for general government debt - the IMF has started to warn that many countries may find themselves squeezed for fiscal space if faced with a new recession anytime soon .
the challenges stem not only from debt that is on the books , but also from hidden liabilities , owing most notably to massively underfunded old @-@ age pension and health @-@ care programs - implicit debts that in many cases are far larger than the official figures .
the overwhelming evidence of recent research supports the IMF view .
countries with historically high debt levels have ( on average ) significantly poorer growth performance in the face of major shocks , and the long @-@ term relation between high public debt and growth is distinctly negative .
this , of course , says absolutely nothing about the economic consequences of actively reducing the burden of government debt , popularly known as &quot; austerity . &quot;
deep recessions are the time to use a country &apos;s war chest , not the time to build it up .
admittedly , there are those on both the left and the right who think &quot; this time is different &quot; for advanced economies .
with no realistic danger ( in their view ) of a major war or financial crisis anytime soon , it is folly to exercise too much restraint on public debt or pension promises .
this is dangerous thinking even for the United States , despite the greater fiscal scope it enjoys as the issuer of the global reserve currency .
very bad shocks can happen to any economy , and their sources might not be the ones we normally consider .
for example , risks stemming from cyberattacks ( especially by state actors ) , pandemics , and certainly financial crises are probably far higher than anyone would like to admit .
it is certainly not difficult to imagine a temporary slowdown in fast @-@ growing China that could roil world markets .
and if the completely unexpected does happen , one thing we can anticipate is that governments with strong access to global credit markets will have much better options for responding .
even if the best bet is that any emerging @-@ market bond meltdown would remain contained , today &apos;s jitters ought to be a wake @-@ up call , even for advanced economies .
after all , no country , however rich , should bet its future on the prospect that today &apos;s ultra @-@ benign interest @-@ rate environment will last forever .
economists who assure us that advanced @-@ economy debt is completely &quot; safe &quot; sound eerily like those who touted the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; - the supposedly permanent reduction in cyclical volatility - a generation ago .
in many cases , they are the same people .
but , as we saw a decade ago , and will inevitably see again , we are not at the &quot; End of History &quot; when it comes to global debt and financial crises .
will Europe Be Willing but disabled ?
NEWPORT BEACH - When it comes to describing Europe &apos;s ever @-@ worsening crisis , metaphors abound .
for some , it is five minutes to midnight ; for others , Europe is a car accelerating towards the edge of a cliff .
for all , a perilous existential moment is increasingly close at hand .
optimists - fortunately , there remain a few , especially in Europe itself - believe that when the situation becomes really critical , political leaders will turn things around and put Europe back on the path of economic growth , job creation , and financial stability .
but pessimists have been growing in number and influence .
they see political dysfunction adding to financial turmoil , thereby amplifying the eurozone &apos;s initial design flaws .
of course , who is ultimately proven correct is a function of eurozone governments &quot; willingness to make the difficult decisions that are required , and in a coordinated and timely fashion .
but that is not the only determinant : governments must also be able to turn things around once the willingness to do so materializes .
and here , the endless delays are making the challenges more daunting and the outcome more uncertain .
experienced observers remind us that crises , rather than vision , have tended to drive progress at critical stages of Europe &apos;s historic integration - a multi @-@ decade journey driven by the desire to ensure long @-@ term peace and prosperity in what previously had been one of the world &apos;s most violent regions and the site of appalling human suffering .
after all , the European Union ( including the eurozone &apos;s 17 members ) remains a collective of nation @-@ states with notable divergences in economic , financial , and social conditions .
cultural differences persist .
political cycles are far from synchronized .
and too many regional governance mechanisms , with the important exception of the European Central Bank , lack sufficient influence , credibility , and , therefore , effectiveness .
left to its own devices , such a grouping is vulnerable to recurrent bickering , disruptive posturing , and disagreement over visions of the future .
as a result , progress towards meaningful economic and political integration can be painfully slow during the good times .
but all of this can change rapidly when a crisis looms , especially if it threatens the integrity of the European project .
that is where the eurozone is today .
a debt crisis that erupted in Greece , the eurozone &apos;s outer periphery , has migrated with a vengeance towards the core , so much so that the survival of the eurozone itself is at stake .
the more the policy response has lagged , the broader the set of questions about Europe &apos;s future has become .
maintaining a 17 @-@ member monetary union is no longer a given .
talk of countries exiting , starting with Greece ( the &quot; Grexit &quot; ) , is now rampant .
and only hard @-@ core idealists dismiss altogether the mounting risk of the eurozone &apos;s total disintegration .
nonetheless , many veterans of the European integration project see a silver lining in the dark clouds massing over their creation .
for them , only a crisis can stop politicians from just kicking various cans farther down the road and , instead , catalyze the policy initiatives - greater fiscal , banking , and political union - that , together with monetary union , would ensure that the eurozone rests on a stable and sustainable four @-@ legged platform .
but this view is not without its own risks .
it assumes that , when push comes to shove , political leaders will indeed do what is necessary - the willingness question .
it also presumes that they will have the capacity to do so - the ability question .
and , over time , uncertainty concerning the latter question has risen to an uncomfortable level .
today &apos;s eurozone is beset by an unprecedented degree of rejection - on economic , financial , political , and social grounds - by citizens in a growing number of countries .
the longer this persists , the harder it will be for politicians to maintain control of their countries &quot; destinies and that of Europe &apos;s collective enterprise .
private @-@ sector activity is slowing , and it is nearing a standstill in the eurozone &apos;s most vulnerable economy ( Greece ) , where a bank run is in full swing .
elsewhere , too , depositors are beginning to transfer their savings to the strongest economy ( Germany ) and to safe havens beyond ( Switzerland and the United States ) .
weaker companies are shedding labor , while stronger firms are delaying investments in plant and equipment .
and global investors continue to exit the eurozone in droves , shifting countries &quot; liabilities to taxpayers and the ECB &apos;s balance sheet .
no wonder that social unrest is evident in a growing number of countries .
no wonder that fringe political movements are gaining traction throughout the eurozone .
and no wonder that voters in almost two @-@ thirds of eurozone countries have turned out the incumbents in their most recent elections .
all of this serves to undermine the effectiveness of government policies - by reducing their credibility , clogging their channels of transmission to the economy , and making it difficult to offset the withdrawal of private @-@ sector capital and spending .
as a result , the market @-@ based economic and financial systems that prevail in Europe , and that , not so long ago , were a source of significant strength , are losing their vibrancy .
I , too , am fond of metaphors .
during a trip to the continent last week , I heard one that captures very well the key dynamic in Europe today .
the eurozone &apos;s leaders are on a raft heading towards a life @-@ threatening waterfall .
the longer they wait , the more the raft gains speed .
so the outcome no longer depends only on their willingness to cooperate in order to navigate the raft to safety . it also hinges on their ability to do so in the midst of natural forces that are increasingly difficult to control and overcome .
the message is clear .
the current crisis might indeed eventually break eurozone leaders &quot; inherent resistance to compromise , collaboration , and common action .
but the longer they bicker and dither , the greater the risk that what they gain in willingness will be lost to incapacity .
will Europe Learn to Love Bush ?
President George W. Bush will soon travel to Europe , and President Jacques Chirac will visit Washington .
EU &quot; Foreign Minister &quot; Javier Solana has already been there , and returned bullish on future transatlantic cooperation .
Atmospherically , at least , relations have , indeed , improved since the US presidential election , and both sides have expressed good will .
yet there is little ground for genuine optimism .
Bush &apos;s declared intention to &quot; better explain the reasons for his decisions &quot; to America &apos;s Allies simply will not do .
Europeans don &apos;t want explanations ; they want to be consulted - to have input into American decision @-@ making and see their concerns reflected in US foreign policy .
none of this is likely to happen .
on the contrary , the US is continuing to thwart European efforts gradually to establish a rule @-@ based international order .
there are no signs that the Bush administration is relenting on , for example , the UN , the Kyoto Protocol , the International Criminal Court , the ban on land mines , or the Anti @-@ Ballistic Missile Treaty .
in Iraq , Europeans fully share the American objectives of preserving the country &apos;s unity and achieving at least some modicum of democracy .
at the same time , they believe that it is up to the US to remove the chaos it created , so they are reluctant to contribute to the task in a substantive way .
European attitudes may seem shortsighted to Americans , but it would need a lot of cajoling to change them .
there is general agreement on the aims to be achieved in the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict : the end of violence and a peaceful solution based on the concept of two sovereign states .
however , Europeans consider the opinion recently expressed by Bush - that Palestinian democracy and not Israeli occupation of the West Bank is at the core of the problem - to be ill conceived .
the same is true with respect to the President &apos;s assertion that Israel &apos;s permanent presence in Palestinian territories and the non @-@ return of Palestinian refugees to their homes in Israel must be accepted as realities on the ground .
it may well be that such painful deviations from agreed principles will be reflected in an eventual comprehensive settlement , but prejudging these issues before the beginning of negotiations denies the Palestinians some of their most important bargaining chips .
on the question of Iran &apos;s nuclear weapons capability , Americans and Europeans also fundamentally agree : it should be prevented .
while the US tries to achieve this through hard power , regime change , sanctions , and threats of pre @-@ emptive military intervention , Europe uses soft power , diplomacy , inclusion , and partnership .
unfortunately , this &quot; good cop , bad cop &quot; game doesn &apos;t work in international politics .
European efforts to induce Teheran to renounce its nuclear designs by addressing Iran &apos;s legitimate security concerns and offering important opportunities for economic and social betterment cannot be successful without active US support .
in other words , Europe &apos;s carrots are not enough ; a successful outcome requires American carrots , too .
by standing aside and discounting the European approach from the outset , America is merely helping to bring about a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy .
it would be more productive for the US to join in , at the same time agreeing with Europeans on measures to be taken should their combined efforts fail .
relations with China have improved over the years on both sides of the Atlantic .
China has become Europe &apos;s biggest trading partner , and its huge reserves of US dollars has made it America &apos;s most important creditor .
despite this rosy picture , China could be the cause of a major transatlantic row if Europeans make good on their intention to lift the arms export embargo in place since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 .
the Bush administration is fiercely opposed to lifting the embargo , pointing out that in the event of a military clash over Taiwan , US troops would face weapons provided to China by America &apos;s own allies .
in fact , European assurances that arms sales to China could be controlled and threats to an ally avoided do appear unconvincing .
on the other hand , economic interdependence between Taiwan and mainland China has grown to such an extent that an armed conflict is increasingly unlikely .
of course , this would change were Taiwan to push for independence , but it would hardly do so without a nod from Washington .
in short , on many of the most important current international issues , Americans and Europeans share the same objectives and basic goals .
where they often diverge is in the means to achieve them .
political wisdom would demand that the two sides pool their considerable resources and march together whenever possible .
this , however , requires a change of attitudes both in America and in Europe .
Bush must be willing to accept Europeans as genuine partners and stop treating them like recalcitrant vassals .
European leaders must overcome any latent Anti @-@ Americanism and be prepared to make the kind of contributions to common endeavors that would entitle them to equal partnership with the US .
will Europe &apos;s Fiscal Compact Work ?
Cambridge - At the start of 2013 , the eurozone &apos;s &quot; fiscal compact &quot; entered into force , owing to its ratification on December 21 by a 12th country , Finland , a year after German Chancellor Angela Merkel prodded eurozone leaders into agreement .
the compact - technically called the Treaty on Stability , Coordination , and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union - requires member countries to introduce laws limiting their structural government budget deficits to less than 0.5 % of GDP ( or less than 1 % of GDP if their debt / GDP ratio is &quot; significantly below 60 % &quot; ) .
so , will this new approach work ?
a limit on the &quot; structural deficit &quot; means that a country can run a deficit above the limit to the extent - and only to the extent - that the gap between revenue and spending is cyclical ( that is , its economy is operating below potential due to temporary negative shocks ) .
in other words , the target is cyclically adjusted .
the budget @-@ balance rule must be adopted in each country - preferably enshrined in their national constitutions - by the end of 2013 .
the aim is to fix Europe &apos;s long @-@ term fiscal problem , which has been exacerbated by three factors : the failure , since the euro &apos;s inception , of the eurozone @-@ wide Stability and Growth Pact ( SGP ) to enforce deficit and debt limits ; the crisis that erupted in Greece and other countries on the eurozone periphery in 2010 ; and the various bailouts that have followed .
there is no reason to doubt that the member states will follow through and adopt national rules by the end of the year .
the problem is what comes after that : the risk that the fiscal compact will founder on precisely the same shoals as the SGP .
ever since the eurozone was established , its members have issued official fiscal forecasts that are systematically biased in the optimistic direction .
other countries do this , too , but the bias among eurozone countries is , if anything , even worse than it is elsewhere .
during an economic expansion , such as in the 2002 @-@ 2007 period , governments are tempted to forecast that the boom will continue indefinitely .
forecasts for tax revenue and budget surpluses are correspondingly optimistic and so hide the need for fiscal adjustment .
during a recession , such as in 2008 @-@ 2012 , governments are tempted to forecast that their economies and budgets will soon rebound .
since forecasting is subject to so much genuine uncertainty , no one can prove that the forecasts are biased when they are made .
but , if forecasts are biased , fiscal rules will not constrain budget deficits . in any given year , governments can forecast that their growth rates , tax revenues , and budget balances will improve in subsequent years , and then argue the following year that the shortfalls were unexpected .
indeed , in a new paper , co @-@ authored with Jesse Schreger , we show that eurozone members &quot; bias in official forecasts can be neatly characterized as responding to the SGP &apos;s 3 % -of @-@ GDP limit on budget deficits in 1999 @-@ 2011 : each time governments exceeded the limit , over @-@ optimistic forecasts followed .
in other words , governments adjust their forecasts , not their policies .
framing the budget rules in cyclical terms , while highly desirable in terms of its macroeconomic impact , does not help to solve the problem of forecast bias .
in fact , it can make the problem worse .
in a year when a forecast for the structural budget deficit turns out to have been over @-@ optimistic , the government can still claim that its own calculations show the shortfall to have been cyclical rather than structural .
after all , estimation of potential output - and hence the cyclical versus structural decomposition of the fiscal position - is notoriously difficult , even after the fact .
perhaps it will help that , under the fiscal compact , the rules are to be adopted at the national level , as opposed to the SGP , which operated on the supranational level .
a look at the various rules and institutions that European countries have already tried shows that some work and others do not .
creating an independent fiscal institution that provides its own budget forecasts works , insofar as it reduces the bias in deficit projections .
when forecasting while in violation of the eurozone &apos;s Excessive Deficit Procedure , eurozone members with an independent budget @-@ forecasting institution have a mean bias that is 2.7 % of GDP smaller at the one @-@ year horizon than members without such an institution .
it would be better still if governments were legally bound to use these independent forecasts in their budget plans ( borrowing an innovation from Chile ) .
but , regardless of how well designed the rules are , clever and determined politicians can find ways around them .
one trick is privatization of government enterprises , which reduces the budget deficit in a given year on a one @-@ time basis , but might increase the deficit in the long run if the enterprise had been profitable .
another trick is to legislate tax cuts that are &quot; temporary , &quot; in order to make future revenues look larger , despite the intention to make the cuts permanent before they expire .
other things being equal , the right institutions can curbpro @-@ cyclical fiscal policies - tax cuts and spending hikes during booms and austerity during downturns - in the short run , while helping to deliver debt sustainability in the long run .
these institutions include independent fiscal @-@ forecasting agencies , combined with the cyclically adjusted budget targets that the eurozone &apos;s fiscal compact mandates .
much can go wrong even if such mechanisms are in place ; but , as the history of the SGP illustrates , the risk is higher if they are not .
will ex @-@ Mexicans Choose America &apos;s Next President ?
among the many surprises during the Republican Party presidential candidates &quot; debates a couple of weeks ago was the rekindled importance of immigration .
after the failure of President George W. Bush &apos;s and Senator Edward Kennedy &apos;s comprehensive immigration reform effort last spring , most observers thought the matter would remain dormant until 2009 , since even touching it was potentially fatal for Democrats and Republicans alike .
but as Democrats discovered in other recent debates , and as Republicans realized with a little help from the CNN organizers , who skewed the questions toward issues they feel strongly about , immigration is an issue that just won &apos;t go away .
this is one reason why I wrote a short but - I hope - useful book on Mexican immigration to the United States , entitled ex @-@ Mex : from Migrants to Immigrants .
based on internal documents from the Mexican and US governments , countless interviews , and a survey of much of the existing literature on the subject , ex @-@ Mex seeks to fulfill three purposes .
first , I wanted to provide a Mexican voice in the immigration debate .
Mexicans make up more than half of the flow and stock - legal or not - of all immigrants in the US , but a point of view attempting to reflect their interests and aspirations has been largely absent from the American discussion .
of course , my book cannot be the Mexican stance .
but an assessment from the vantage point of past , current , and future Mexican immigrants to the US is a necessary component of the American debate - all the more so when one recalls that immigration has , in fact , not generally been exclusively a domestic US policy question .
the first American immigration agreement with another country was signed in 1907 - the so @-@ called gentleman &apos;s Agreement with Japan , while the US and Mexico negotiated and administered the Bracero Program for more than twenty years , from 1942 thru 1964 .
and , of course , the US has had a standing immigration agreement since 1965 with a country most Americans would not imagine : Fidel Castro &apos;s Cuba .
second , it is important to place the current , raging debate in historical context .
the most important feature of that context is that the actual flow of Mexicans entering the US today is not much greater than the overall average figure for the Bracero Program period : around 400,000 per year .
it is similarly important to understand the evolution of US legislation on immigration since the 1920 &quot; s , and the shifts and hypocrisy involved in the application of those laws .
for example , the 1996 immigration reforms implemented by the Clinton administration , along with other , underlying structural trends , halted the traditional circular pattern whereby Mexicans came and went to the US every year .
instead , they began to settle in communities farther from the border , greatly increasing the stock of Mexicans in the US .
finally , the efforts of the Mexican and US governments since 2001 to reach an accommodation on the issue have not been well understood .
confidential papers from the Bush and Fox administrations show that talks went further than previously known .
the US , and particularly then @-@ Secretary of State Colin Powell , was willing , as stated in a unclassified memo addressed to Bush in late August 2001 , to go to great lengths to reach an understanding with Mexico on the issue .
indeed , the substance of the negotiations was not much different from the content of the Bush @-@ Kennedy &quot; grand bargain &quot; that was fashioned in 2007 .
the electoral numbers perhaps best explain the immigration equation &apos;s importance in today &apos;s presidential campaigns .
in 2008 , it is likely that Latinos will make up 9 % to 10 % of the electorate , the highest share ever .
they will wield decisive importance in swing states like Colorado , New Mexico , Florida , and Nevada .
having made significant inroads among Hispanic voters in 2000 and 2004 , thanks to Bush &apos;s support for immigration reform , Republicans now can barely count on 20 % of that total - mainly among Cuban @-@ Americans - thanks to their strident anti @-@ immigration stance .
thus , if the Democrats demonstrate a minimum of compassion , sensitivity , and realism , they can count on a 7 % advantage in the popular vote .
but doing so could cost Democrats dearly in old industrial states like Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Michigan , where the arrival of Mexican migrants , transformed into immigrants , has stoked passions .
since the Democrats &quot; victory will most likely depend on these states , the Democratic candidate who can square this circle , or the Republican who can break it , may well win the presidency .
will Global Imbalances Return ?
Beijing - Future history books , depending on where they are written , will take one of two approaches to assigning blame for the world &apos;s current financial and economic crisis .
one approach will blame lax regulation , accommodating monetary policy , and inadequate savings in the United States . the other , already being pushed by former and current US officials like Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke , will blame the immense pool of liquidity generated by high @-@ savings countries in East Asia and the Middle East .
all that liquidity , they will argue , had to go somewhere . its logical destination was the country with the deepest financial markets , the US , where it raised asset prices to unsustainable heights .
note the one thing on which members of both camps agree : the global savings imbalance - low savings in the US and high savings in China and other emerging markets - played a key role in the crisis by allowing Americans to live beyond their means .
it encouraged financiers desperate to earn a return on abundant funds to put them to more speculative use .
if there is a consensus on one issue , it is the impossibility of understanding the bubble and the crash without considering the role of global imbalances .
preventing future crises similar to this one therefore requires resolving the problem of global imbalances .
here , the early signs are reassuring .
American households are saving again .
the US trade deficit has declined from $ 60 billion a month to just $ 26 billion , according to the most recent data .
as a matter of simple arithmetic , we know that the rest of the world is running correspondingly smaller surpluses .
but once American households rebuild their retirement accounts , they may return to their profligate ways .
indeed , the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve are doing all they can to pump up US spending .
the only reason the US trade deficit is falling is that the country remains in a severe recession , causing US imports and exports to collapse in parallel .
with recovery , both may recover to previous levels , and the 6 % -of @-@ GDP US external deficit will be back .
in fact , there has been no change in relative prices or depreciation of the US dollar of a magnitude that would augur a permanent shift in trade and spending patterns .
whether there is a permanent reduction in global imbalances will depend mainly on decisions taken outside the US , specifically in countries like China .
one &apos;s forecast of those decisions hinges , in turn , on why these other countries came to run such large surpluses in the first place .
one view is that their surpluses were a corollary of the policies favoring export @-@ led growth that worked so well for so long . China &apos;s leaders are understandably reluctant to abandon a tried @-@ and @-@ true model .
they can &apos;t restructure their economy instantaneously .
they can &apos;t move workers from painting children &apos;s toys in Guangdong to building schools in Western China overnight .
they need time to build a social safety net capable of encouraging Chinese households to reduce their precautionary saving .
if this view is correct , we can expect to see global imbalances re @-@ emerge once the recession is over and to unwind only slowly thereafter .
the other view is that China contributed to global imbalances not through its merchandise exports , but through its capital exports .
what China lacked was not demand for consumption goods , but a supply of high @-@ quality financial assets .
it found these in the US , mainly in the form Treasury and other government @-@ backed securities , in turn pushing other investors into more speculative investments .
recent events have not enhanced the stature of the US as a supplier of high @-@ quality assets .
and China , for its part , will continue to develop its financial markets and its capacity to generate high @-@ quality financial assets internally .
but doing so will take time . meanwhile , the US still has the most liquid financial markets in the world .
this interpretation again implies the re @-@ emergence of global imbalances once the recession ends , and their very gradual unwinding thereafter .
one development that could change this forecast is if China comes to view investing in US financial assets as a money @-@ losing proposition .
US budget deficits as far as the eye can see might excite fear of losses on US Treasury bonds .
a de facto policy of inflating away the debt might stoke such fears further .
at that point , China would pull the plug , the dollar would crash , and the Fed would be forced to raise interest rates , plunging the US back into recession .
there are two hopes for avoiding this disastrous outcome .
one is relying on Chinese goodwill to stabilize the US and world economies . the other is for the Obama administration and the Fed to provide details about how they will eliminate the budget deficit and avoid inflation once the recession ends .
the second option is clearly preferable .
after all , it is always better to control one &apos;s own fate .
will Governmental folly Now allow for a Cyber Crisis ?
Cambridge - When the financial crisis of 2008 hit , many shocked critics asked why markets , regulators , and financial experts failed to see it coming .
today , one might ask the same question about the global economy &apos;s vulnerability to cyber @-@ attack .
indeed , the parallels between financial crises and the threat of cyber meltdowns are striking .
although the greatest cyber threat comes from rogue states with the capacity to develop extremely sophisticated computer viruses , risks can also come from anarchistic hackers and terrorists , or even from computer glitches compounded by natural catastrophe .
a few security experts have voiced great alarm , including , most recently , Jonathan Evans , the head of the British Security Service ( MI5 ) .
by and large , however , few leaders are willing to compromise growth in the tech sector or the Internet in any significant way in the name of a threat that is so amorphous .
instead , they prefer to establish relatively innocuous working groups and task forces .
it is difficult to overstate the dependence of modern economies on large @-@ scale computer systems .
but imagine if one day a host of key communications satellites were incapacitated , or the databases of major financial systems were erased .
experts have long identified the electricity grid as the most acute vulnerability , since any modern economy would collapse without power .
true , many skeptics argue that with reasonable low @-@ cost prophylactic measures , large scale cyber @-@ meltdowns are highly implausible , and that doom @-@ mongers overstate the worst @-@ case scenarios .
they say that the ability of cyber @-@ terrorists and blackmailers to take the global economy to the brink , as in the 2007 Bruce Willis movie Die Hard 4 , is utterly fictional .
it is difficult to judge who is right , and there are important experts on both sides of the debate .
but there do seem to be an uncomfortable number of similarities between the political economy of cyberspace regulation and of financial regulation .
first , both cyber @-@ security and financial stability are extremely complex topics with which government regulators can hardly keep up .
industry remuneration for experts is far in excess of any public @-@ sector salary , and the best minds are continually bid away .
as a result , some argue that the only solution is reliance on self @-@ regulation by the software industry .
one hears this argument for many modern industries , from big food to big Pharma to big finance .
second , like the financial sector , the tech industry is enormously influential politically through contributions and lobbying .
in the United States , all presidential candidates must make pilgrimages to Silicon Valley and other tech centers to raise money .
excessive financial @-@ sector influence was , of course , a root cause of the 2008 meltdown and remains deeply implicated in today &apos;s continuing eurozone mess .
third , with slowing growth in advanced economies , information technology seems to hold the moral high ground , just as finance did until five years ago .
and crude attempts by governments to enforce regulation are likely to prove ineffective in protecting against catastrophe , while all too effective in strangling growth .
in both cases - financial stability and cyber security - the risk of contagion creates a situation in which a wedge can form between private incentives and social risks .
admittedly , progress in the technology sector overall often produces huge social @-@ welfare gains , which arguably outstrip those produced by all other sectors in recent decades .
but , just as with nuclear power plants , progress can go awry in the absence of good regulation .
finally , the greatest risks come from arrogance and ignorance , two human characteristics at the heart of most financial crises .
recent revelations about the super @-@ viruses &quot; Stuxnet &quot; and &quot; flame &quot; are particularly disconcerting .
these viruses , apparently developed by the US and Israel to disrupt Iran &apos;s nuclear program , embody a level of sophistication far beyond anything previously seen .
both are deeply encrypted and difficult to detect once inside a computer .
the flame virus has the capacity to take over a computer &apos;s peripherals , record Skype conversations , take pictures through a computer &apos;s camera , and transmit information via Bluetooth to any nearby device .
if the world &apos;s most sophisticated governments are developing computer viruses , what guarantee is there that something won &apos;t go awry ?
how can we be sure that they won &apos;t &quot; escape &quot; and infect a much broader class of systems , or be adopted for other uses , or that future rogue states or terrorists won &apos;t find a way to turn them on their creators ?
no economy is more vulnerable than the US , and it is arrogance to believe that US cyber superiority ( to all except perhaps China ) provides it with impenetrable security from attack .
unfortunately the solution is not so simple as just building better anti @-@ virus programs .
virus protection and virus development constitute an uneven arms race .
a virus can be just a couple hundred lines of computer code , compared to hundreds of thousands of lines for anti @-@ virus programs , which must be designed to detect wide classes of enemies .
we are told not to worry about large @-@ scale cyber meltdowns , because none has occurred , and governments are being vigilant .
unfortunately , another lesson of the financial crisis is that most politicians are congenitally incapable of making difficult choices until risks actually materialize .
let us hope that we are lucky for a while longer .
will Hamas Win the Peace ?
Washington , DC -for generations to come , the Palestinians will remember the horrific war in Gaza with pain and bitterness .
but what cannot yet be seen is how Palestinians will view Hamas .
whether Hamas can claim a victory - and whether Palestinians will believe them will be determined by the type of ceasefire that is eventually agreed , if a formal one is eventually agreed .
the end game - for both Israel and Hamas - is thus crucially important .
for the moment , Hamas is perceived by the majority of Palestinians as the victim of a war intended to gain its surrender .
after all , Hamas was democratically elected , but was forbidden from ruling and besieged in Gaza .
at the same time , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is accused of siding with Israel in order to restore his lost authority in Gaza .
the war exposed flaws in Hamas &quot; judgment .
Hamas apparently did not envision a full @-@ scale confrontation with Israel when it refused to renew a six @-@ month truce .
with Gaza suffering under a lengthy siege , Hamas leader Khalid Mashal said that there was no point in a new truce , since the old one had &quot; failed to lift the siege on Gaza . &quot;
other leaders were quoted as saying that Hamas would &quot; lift the siege by force . &quot;
if Hamas is to survive the war , it must demonstrate that its resistance resulted in a permanent opening of Gaza &apos;s border crossings , especially in Rafah .
for Palestinians , these are signs of victory .
with open borders , Hamas would secure its regime in Gaza and build its popularity in the West Bank , putting enormous pressure on Abbas , the leader of the rival Fatah movement , to accept a national unity government on terms set by Hamas .
members of Fatah &apos;s Central Committee are already accusing Abbas of supporting Israel in the fighting , of wanting to &quot; return to Gaza on an Israeli tank . &quot;
radical groups within Fatah are leaning toward an open alliance with Hamas .
if Hamas comes out ahead , Abbas &apos;s allies in other Palestinian factions will press him to accept Hamas and Islamic Jihad within the PLO .
Egypt will have to backtrack on its rejection of Hamas in order to recover its image among the Arabs and to reduce tensions within Egyptian society .
pressure to integrate Hamas into Palestinian politics is also likely in some European capitals , particularly Paris and London , where some expressed opposition to isolating Hamas even before the war .
but if Israel forces Hamas to accept its conditions for border controls and a formal ceasefire , Hamas &apos;s image as the guardian of Palestinian resistance will be severely damaged .
Palestinians will ask if it was really necessary to fight this war and pay such a high price .
Abbas will be able to argue that he advised Hamas to renew the truce and to end its missile fire on Israeli towns , but that Hamas insisted on exposing Palestinian civilians to devastation .
one indicator to watch for : the length of that ceasefire .
Palestinians will recognize Hamas &apos;s acceptance of a multi @-@ year truce with Israel as a sign of defeat , which would also underscore Palestinian feelings of humiliation and abandonment .
Hezbollah , despite its rhetoric , has taken no steps to support Hamas , and the Arab states seemed more than willing to support its defeat .
it is in rebuilding Gaza that the stakes of the competition will increase .
Abbas , supported by the United States and the European Union , may have control over significant funding .
the test for him will be to deliver quickly .
Hamas will also have resources for reconstruction .
Qatar , a Hamas supporter , has already announced an investment fund for Gaza and contributed $ 250 million .
Hamas will have to make a convincing case that Gaza &apos;s near destruction is a price that had to be paid .
many Palestinians believe that Israel inflicted this damage on Gaza to drive a wedge between the people and the &quot; resistance . &quot;
there is a precedent for this argument : Hezbollah described the destruction of Beirut &apos;s southern suburbs in exactly these terms at the end of the Lebanon War in July 2006 .
more importantly , Hamas can demonstrate that its leaders have been on the front lines during this war , sharing Palestinian suffering ; many have been killed , along with their families .
the biggest question is whether the war will alter Hamas &quot; political goals .
two weeks ago , Musa Abu Marzouk , a senior Hamas official , praised Jimmy Carter in The Los Angeles Times as the only American president who had brought true peace in the Middle East .
this is a radical departure from Hamas rhetoric , which has always portrayed the Camp David agreement between Israel and Egypt as a betrayal of the Islamic world .
it remains to be seen whether Abu Marzouk &apos;s view is merely a tactic intended to encourage the Obama administration to reach out to Hamas , or whether the war convinced Hamas that the two @-@ state solution is the only viable option to settle the conflict with Israel .
the framing of MH @-@ 17
Philadelphia - US President Barack Obama called the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 an &quot; outrage of unspeakable proportions , &quot; whereas Russian President Vladimir Putin termed it an &quot; accident &quot; and a &quot; terrible tragedy . &quot;
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko branded it an &quot; act of terrorism , &quot; and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called it an &quot; inhumane , uncivilized , violent , and irresponsible act . &quot;
all of these descriptions may be accurate , but each carries different rhetorical weight and legal implications .
the time has come for governments and international organizations to call the attack on MH17 a probable war crime .
this rhetorical shift is needed , first and foremost , because framing the moral reprehensibility of this despicable act within a common language will help to align public perceptions of it .
as it stands , the public narrative in Russia and the West diverges sharply .
Russian media and officials portray the episode as , at best , a terrible mistake , and , at worst , an American plot to undermine support for the rebels .
Americans and Europeans , for their part , increasingly blame Russia for possibly equipping or assisting the rebels .
as a result , the possibility of achieving a common understanding of the act is being lost - and , with it , whatever potential there may be for meaningful cooperation .
but , by recognizing the downing of MH17 as a war crime , governments may be able to create an opening to reconcile these narratives .
whatever the perpetrators &quot; underlying motives , there is no denying the moral and legal wrongdoing that occurred .
calling the offense by its legal name acknowledges this , thereby preempting a rhetorical battle to frame the attack as terror , tragedy , or conspiracy .
even the Russians may be willing to accept this framing , because it avoids finger @-@ pointing against particular actors and affirms that a court of law - not a series of media statements - will determine what occurred and who is responsible .
in fact , another important reason to characterize the downing of MH17 publicly as a war crime is that it may prove beneficial in apprehending the perpetrators .
there is a real danger that those responsible for pressing the launch button - and , perhaps , for ordering the launch - will disappear into the chaos of eastern Ukraine , the vast expanses of Russia , or elsewhere .
there is also a danger that the perpetrators , if found , might avoid trial if the local authorities label the crime political , and thus exempt from normal extradition requirements .
all of the relevant states in the region have accepted the legal obligation to assist in the investigation and prosecution of war crimes .
the obligation to prosecute suspected war criminals , or extradite them to face prosecution elsewhere , becomes more compelling in accordance with the seriousness of the alleged crime .
while the full details of the attack on MH17 remain unknown , shooting a surface @-@ to @-@ air missile at a civilian airliner flying over a war zone is most likely a violation of the law of war - by which the Ukrainian government , the Russian government , and the rebels are all bound .
indeed , the conflict in eastern Ukraine constitutes a non @-@ international armed conflict ( a war between a government and rebel movement ) governed by international humanitarian law , which categorically bans the intentional targeting of civilians .
in other words , if whoever launched the missile did so with the intent of killing the civilian passengers aboard MH17 , the act was unmistakably a war crime .
even if the objective was to strike a Ukrainian transport aircraft , the act likely constitutes a war crime .
fundamental to the law of war , including the law applicable in non @-@ international armed conflicts , is the principle of distinction - the requirement that fighting parties distinguish between civilian and military targets .
in the words of the International Committee of the Red Cross , that duty of care includes doing &quot; everything feasible to verify that targets are military objectives . &quot;
in this case , many steps could easily have been taken to differentiate MH17 from a military @-@ transport plane , including visual identification ( perhaps with binoculars ) , radar @-@ signature analysis , and a check of the civilian aircraft transponder @-@ code broadcast .
if , as seems likely , these basic steps were not taken , even an accidental strike on MH17 would constitute a war crime .
a Dutch or Malaysian court , or even a special tribunal under the auspices of the United Nations ( like the one that prosecuted the 1988 Pan Am Lockerbie bombing ) , will ultimately determine who bears legal responsibility for the downing of MH17 .
framing the attack as a likely war crime now - as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has done - may help to reconcile the conflicting narratives that are emerging .
and , perhaps more important , doing so can play a key role in securing the political , diplomatic , and legal support needed to bring the perpetrators to justice .
China &apos;s New Reforms in Theory and practice
Hong KONG - On November 12 , the Third Plenary of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) announced a major turn to market @-@ oriented policies : interest @-@ rate and currency liberalization , reform of banks and state enterprises , clearer land ownership for rural inhabitants , and a better deal for urban migrants .
behind this landmark decision was a potential crisis .
China &apos;s success has been driven by cheap exports based on cheap labor , infrastructure built by state enterprises with low @-@ cost bank funding , and government budgets funded by land sales .
but labor is no longer cheap , road construction to connect major cities has given way to building large shopping malls in small towns , and land sales based on rezoning are reaching both economic limits and the limits of villagers &quot; tolerance .
cheap money with limited investment outlets now risks fueling property bubbles and industrial overcapacity .
without fundamental change , China faces slower economic growth , inadequate job creation and innovation , and popping bubbles .
the solution is a rapid shift from China &apos;s export @-@ based growth model to one based on domestic demand ; from infrastructure to consumption ; from the dominance of large state @-@ owned enterprises ( SOEs ) to that of small and medium @-@ size private enterprises ; from industry to services ; and , more broadly , from bureaucratic control to market control .
all successful Asian countries have made this shift ; South Korea and Taiwan are models .
but rapid change entails immense pain .
SOEs will lose their low @-@ interest loans , subsidized land , monopoly protection , and privileged housing .
party and state bureaucracies will lose power ( and income ) .
local governments are particularly desperate .
they have huge debts , which they amortize by rezoning and selling land .
already squeezed by exorbitant property prices and popular resistance to land takings , they now face higher interest rates , property taxes , villagers empowered by stronger rights , and expensive new requirements to provide social services to migrants .
the desperation of local potentates and SOE executives has created powerful resistance to reform .
at a plenary reportedly marked by acrimony , China &apos;s political leaders sided with reform .
as one economic planner said , when asked about resistance before the decisive meeting , &quot; In the end , all of our leaders understand numbers .
the implications of the numbers are clear . &quot;
the Third Plenum &apos;s announcement of its decisions took the form of a statement of broad principles , leaving many observers concerned by the lack of detail .
but the CCP &apos;s role is to set the direction of policy ; executing the Party &apos;s decisions is the government &apos;s job .
and the Plenum did establish a top @-@ level group to coordinate and enforce implementation of its decisions .
while implementation will be a long struggle , with occasionally fierce resistance , key reforms are already underway .
the current 12th Five @-@ Year Plan calls for annual wage increases to average at least 13.4 % ; this year , wages are rising at an average rate of 18 % , which will squeeze out industries characterized by obsolescence or overcapacity .
moreover , the government &apos;s anti @-@ corruption campaign is targeting some of the most powerful industry groups , such as the petroleum faction , thereby weakening their resistance to reform .
most important , economic outcomes are becoming increasingly aligned with the authorities &quot; goals .
services already account for more output and employment than industry - the Internet company Alibaba , for example , is empowering both consumers and smaller companies on a previously unimaginable scale - and recent growth has been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports .
reform is not just a plan ; it is already happening .
economic openings to Central Asia and to ASEAN ( specifically to Vietnam ) are well underway , and reform will include further international opening .
the Third Plenum &apos;s decisions follow the launch in September of the Shanghai Free @-@ Trade Zone , which will open new sectors to foreign investment and permit largely market @-@ based financial transactions and capital flows .
the liberalization of capital flows is intended to be a gradual national policy , channeled through trusted institutions in Shanghai .
for trade in goods , the new free @-@ trade zone is intended to compete directly with Singapore and Hong Kong .
China fears dependence on those entrepôts in the event of conflict .
for foreign investors , the policy will be to expand greatly the range of opportunities while curtailing foreign control ; foreign companies , for example , may hold minority stakes in the telecoms sector , while dominant foreign companies like Monsanto will face constraints .
President Xi Jinping faces the politically risky task of pushing the CCP &apos;s reform agenda against fierce opposition while the economy slows .
by emphasizing Party control - through a crackdown on SOEs , government opponents , and critics in the media and academia - Xi seeks to maximize his ability to impose economic reforms while minimizing the risk of a challenge from conservative forces .
above all , he is determined to avoid the fate of previous Chinese leaders like Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang , who lost their jobs after a critical mass of their opponents came to believe that economic and political reform jeopardized Party control .
so , at least for now , China will focus on another great wave of economic reform , whereas political reform will mostly be limited to reorganization of government agencies to boost efficiency and strengthen efforts to reduce corruption .
( there have been some steps toward reform , including a decision to remove judges from local political control . )
and yet China will find it increasingly difficult to postpone stronger measures that would appease popular demands for fairness , including the establishment of an independent judiciary , which could prove to be no less an imperative than structural economic reforms .
likewise , the leaders must either accept much of the information revolution &apos;s swamping of controls or engage in far more costly repression .
hopes for political reform rest on the possibility that Xi &apos;s second term will see the accession to top leadership of reformers like Politburo member Wang Yang and Vice President Li Yuanchao .
for now , however , China will focus on another great wave of economic reform .
China &apos;s Xi Factor
Hong KONG - Before China &apos;s leadership transition earlier this year , experts said that the Chinese Communist Party was intent on preventing a larger @-@ than @-@ life personality from assuming power .
the CCP , it was argued , wanted someone more like the bureaucratic outgoing leader , Hu Jintao , rather than a charismatic successor like , say , the former Chongqing provincial governor Bo Xilai .
yet the new president and CCP leader , Xi Jinping , is hardly dull .
he began his term by paying homage to Deng Xiaoping at his statue in Shenzhen , where , more than three decades ago , the former Communist Party leader had launched the campaign to convert a reluctant Party to free @-@ market reforms .
in a top @-@ level November meeting , Xi set out the details of a fundamental change in economic direction , overshadowing his colleagues .
Xi now leads a new economic group that will coordinate and impose his reforms on fractious colleagues .
and , unlike Hu , he immediately became head of the military and now runs a parallel national security council .
at first glance , a new &quot; paramount leader &quot; appears to be emerging .
recent history explains this re @-@ concentration of power .
in 1993 , central @-@ government leaders enjoyed relatively limited powers : they did not control the money supply and had difficulty firing provincial governors or relocating top generals .
central government revenue was low ; indeed , proportionately smaller than that of central governments in any other major economy .
this changed when then @-@ Party leader Jiang Zemin and his prime minister , Zhu Rongji , centralized authority in order to stave off economic crisis at a time of growing risk to China &apos;s banks .
in the process , the labor force of China &apos;s state enterprises declined by 50 million , China lost 25 million manufacturing jobs , and central @-@ government employment was slashed .
these measures saved China &apos;s economy , but at the price of widespread social stress , which made Zhu widely disliked when he left office .
popular reaction against the cosmopolitan , coastal , and market @-@ oriented reforms of Zhu and Jiang brought to power leaders whose formative experiences were in the inland provinces of Gansu and Tibet .
riding a wave of resentment against inequality and social tensions , Hu and his prime minister , Wen Jiabao , promised a &quot; harmonious society , &quot; without the stresses of Zhu &apos;s agenda .
they slowed economic reform and ceased political reforms .
the bureaucracy expanded from 40 million to 70 million , and power devolved to provinces , bureaucracies , and state @-@ owned enterprises ( SOEs ) .
the somnolent Hu / Wen era , fortunately , did not dampen the economic growth triggered by the earlier reforms undertaken by Jiang and Zhu .
but the economic @-@ growth model that those reforms created was running out of steam .
low @-@ cost exports were struggling as labor costs rose .
investment in infrastructure was shifting from growth @-@ enhancing projects , such as inter @-@ city highways , to less productive shopping malls in second- and third @-@ tier cities .
productivity plummeted in SOEs , whose privileged access to financing crowded out private @-@ sector investment .
local @-@ government funding , through the seizure and resale of property , was reaching its limits .
thus , it became essential to launch a new wave of far @-@ reaching reforms , including liberalization of interest rates , securities markets , and foreign @-@ exchange controls , in order to fund the more productive private sector and reduce excess capacity in SOEs .
in particular , the reforms were needed to deflate an emerging property bubble resulting from huge savings and foreign capital inflows that had no other profitable investment outlet .
the government planned to liberalize interest rates and the capital account to encourage investment in modern , high @-@ value industries , rather than continue to subsidize low @-@ value exports .
it started to shift the economy &apos;s base from export @-@ oriented industries to domestic growth , and from manufacturing to services .
and it announced its intention to slow local governments &quot; seizures of farmland and excessive borrowing through captive enterprises .
unsurprisingly , opposition to reform was implacable .
SOEs were determined to defend their privileges .
highly leveraged local governments could not tolerate higher interest rates or an appreciating currency , and they were adamant about continuing land sales and opposing property taxes .
they feared the financial burden of new requirements to provide social services to urban migrants .
as a result , a new , lean leadership team had to be mobilized .
the number of top leaders was cut from nine to seven .
the new lineup eliminated the most powerful voice on the left ( Bo ) and relegated the &quot; extreme reformers &quot; on the right ( Li Yuanchao and Wang Yang ) to the second tier .
to reduce elders &quot; interference , Hu stepped down as head of the military and Jiang Zemin promised to step back .
moreover , a leading economic group was established to enforce bureaucratic compliance , as was a national security council ( similar to that in the United States ) to coordinate foreign policy .
previously , the military often kept the foreign ministry in the dark ; and the party &apos;s foreign @-@ affairs office , which handled North Korea , often failed to coordinate its activities with the foreign ministry , which handled South Korea .
an anti @-@ corruption campaign weakened opposition , and Zhu re @-@ emerged as a hero .
this set the stage for Xi &apos;s arrival .
in short , the new @-@ style leadership , a form of managed charisma , was collectively designed to serve national needs .
and it implies that Xi is unlikely to emerge as paramount leader .
the Chinese presidency &apos;s authority has certainly increased ; but Xi is powerful only when he has the votes .
on contentious issues , he has but one of seven .
desperate Women &apos;s Dangerous Moves
Geneva - One of the most significant recent trends in migration has been the rise in the number of women using dangerous routes previously used mainly by men .
more and more women - fleeing discrimination , violence , or poverty - are now taking the same risks as men in search of a better life for themselves and their children .
this is desperation migration .
indeed , while many women travel with their families , the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) is seeing an increasing number of women migrating on their own to an unknown , unpredictable , and often dangerous future .
women and children migrants are dying with increasing frequency at sea , crossing deserts , and on other hazardous routes .
what has changed ?
among the many factors pushing women to migrate are pervasive gender bias and social prejudices against single mothers or widows in their country of origin .
but poverty is almost always the strongest force driving women to leave .
in most poor countries , women are poorer than men , owing to the systematic discrimination that they face in education , health care , employment , and control of assets .
of course , most migrant women do not encounter mistreatment or die on their journeys ; in fact , many derive real benefits from migration .
but , among the world &apos;s estimated 111 million migrant women ( half the total ) , violence and abuse can occur at any time , starting from the very outset of the migration process .
throughout the migration cycle , women are more at risk from physical violence by fellow migrants , smugglers , and state officers , and can be forced to exchange sex for transportation , food , or accommodation .
unsurprisingly , migrant women are often victims of human trafficking , finding themselves enslaved as laborers , prostitutes , or participants in organized begging operations .
this is true regardless of why women migrate .
when women run for their lives because of natural or man @-@ made disasters , gender @-@ based violence is one of the great risks they face .
displaced women , often destitute , are easy prey for criminals .
this was one of my immediate concerns when Typhoon Haiyan struck the Philippines , and at my request a special program was instituted to alert and help women in peril .
even when women migrants find a job in a host country , it is rarely easy for them .
they are predominantly employed in domestic work , care @-@ giving , agriculture , and entertainment - all low @-@ paid , largely unregulated sectors that are rarely covered by national labor laws .
they are often subject to punishingly long working hours , non @-@ payment of wages , forced confinement , starvation , beating , sexual abuse , and threats and intimidation .
many women migrants are unskilled or undocumented domestic workers .
this makes them more vulnerable to violence , because they typically depend on a single employer and in many countries face deportation if they attempt to change jobs .
moreover , social integration in a new country can be more difficult for women than for men .
this is partly because women are often subject to harmful traditional practices , such as early and forced marriage , female genital mutilation , and so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; crimes , enforced by families who want to maintain a link with their country of origin .
and it is especially difficult for women migrants to navigate between the tantalizing freedom of choice and expression in their host society and the traditional roles expected of them at home .
the rising number of migrant deaths - both women and men - at sea and in deserts is a wake @-@ up call for the international community to act .
IOM has called on all relevant actors - including countries of origin , transit countries , and destination countries - to address the plight of migrants attempting life @-@ threatening journeys and find solutions .
protecting women migrants - often the most desperate of the desperate - should top their priorities .
in 2014 , the international community will review the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , which expire next year , and decide on a post @-@ 2015 development agenda .
IOM believes that migrants , and in particular women migrants , who in the past have been largely invisible in the language of development , must be a part of this .
we must no longer ignore half the world &apos;s migrants .
like all migrants , women on the move are entitled to personal security and basic dignity .
will NATO &apos;s prodigal Son Return ?
Paris -- Few state visits have lasting results .
Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s just completed trip to Washington may be an exception , because the French President may be preparing to bring NATO a highly valued present for its 60th anniversary in the spring of 2009 : France &apos;s return to NATO &apos;s integrated military structure , from which Charles de Gaulle withdrew in 1966 .
in retrospect , de Gaulle &apos;s decision proved to be much more detrimental for France than for the Alliance .
by withdrawing from NATO &apos;s integrated military command , France excluded itself from political decision @-@ making within the Alliance and thus became the equivalent of the &quot; Harkis &quot; - the local soldiers who served with the French army during the Algerian war : fine soldiers , but with virtually no reward for their service .
how realistic is the possibility of scenario French return to NATO &apos;s military fold ?
historically , aborted moves and faux pas abound on both sides in the French / NATO relationship , the latest being Jacques Chirac &apos;s failed attempt to patch up France &apos;s relations with NATO upon his arrival in power in 1995 .
success is not guaranteed this time , either , but the chances are much higher now , because France , the United States , and the world have changed .
for starters , the US now has a real friend and ally in the Élysée Palace .
to speak of Sarkozy as a substitute for Tony Blair in Europe would be premature - and unhelpful , given Blair &apos;s inability to exert significant influence on US policy .
but Sarkozy is both eager to transform France &apos;s relations with the Alliance and has a strategy to do so .
moreover , the French army supports such a move , while only a small segment of the Foreign Ministry is opposed .
Sarkozy &apos;s strategy is to link progress in building a common European defense and security structure with a redefinition of NATO .
more Europe in security terms means more Alliance .
so , because Sarkozy wants to be seen as a convinced European , he must normalize France &apos;s relations with a new Alliance based on two pillars - European and American .
moreover , financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be duplicated , while France and Britain want to restart the Saint @-@ Malo process of bilateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago .
as a result , for the sake of Europe , France must move closer to the Alliance .
Sarkozy has also fully integrated into France &apos;s approach to Europe a reckoning with the new balance of power within the European Union following the accession of Eastern European states .
unlike Chirac , he understands that it is counterproductive and unrealistic to ask countries like Bulgaria or Romania to choose between their European or Atlantic loyalties .
here , again , strengthening Europe requires strengthening the Alliance .
Sarkozy &apos;s approach may work , because America , too , has changed .
in American eyes , the Kosovo war in 1999 demonstrated NATO &apos;s glaring and myriad shortcomings , while the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , moved America still further away from the Alliance , particularly after President George W. Bush disparagingly rejected NATO &apos;s offer of help .
former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld even tried to use divide @-@ and @-@ rule tactics by pitting &quot; New &quot; Europe against the &quot; Old &quot; Europe led by France and Germany , which opposed the Iraq war .
those divisions are now history , and American reservations about a European security pillar cannot trump America &apos;s pressing needs for allied support .
confronted with disaster in Iraq , the risk of Afghanistan following Iraq into chaos , and the escalating crisis with Iran , the US can no longer treat the NATO allies with disdain .
although Europe remains militarily weak , America &apos;s power is now in doubt .
if a European pillar within NATO is needed to strengthen the Alliance , why not accept it ?
beyond the changes in France and the US , the decisive factor behind the possible reinvention of NATO is the transformation of the international system itself .
aside from the explosive situation in the Middle East and the threat of Islamist terrorism , the West is now confronted with the rise of Asia , the return of a more assertive Russia , and new energy and environmental challenges .
both France and America have a key role to play in addressing these issues effectively .
Sarkozy &apos;s trip to Washington , and his address to a receptive US Congress , was one more step toward ensuring that they do so together .
bankers with Borders
London - When Mark Carney replaces Mervyn King as Governor of the Bank of England in July 2013 , the world will be deprived of King &apos;s witty public utterances .
my personal favorite came when , commenting on strong retail @-@ sales figures during one Christmas period , he cast doubt on their significance for assessing the state of the economy .
&quot; the true meaning of the story of Christmas &quot; he solemnly intoned , &quot; will not be revealed until Easter , or possibly much later . &quot; a new career on the stage , or in the pulpit , surely beckons .
King &apos;s most quoted phrase is that &quot; global banking institutions are global in life , but national in death . &quot;
they trade globally , across porous borders , attaching little significance to the geographical location of capital and liquidity .
but , when the music stops , it is the home regulator , and the home central bank , that picks up the tab , even if the losses were incurred elsewhere .
by the same token , a failing bank may leave behind a mess in third countries , which its home authorities may not clean up .
Icelandic banks , for example , took deposits in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , and swept them back to Reykjavik , leaving the host countries out of pocket .
likewise , the collapse of Lehman Brothers left European creditors more exposed than those in the US , whose funds had been wired home to New York on the Friday before the end .
regulators have been wrestling with this problem for years , without conspicuous success .
in mid @-@ December , the Bank of England ( BoE ) and the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) announced what seemed like a breakthrough , at least concerning the major banks headquartered in the US or the UK - that is , 12 of the 28 institutions regarded by the Financial Stability Board as globally systemic .
in their case , a resolution authority , in London or Washington , would take control of the parent company , remove senior management , and apportion losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors .
it sounded plausible .
BoE officials declared firmly that they were prepared to trust their American counterparts , and would not step in to grab subsidiaries or assets based in the UK .
&quot; this is a journey that involves trust , &quot; said BoE Deputy Governor Paul Tucker .
but the Anglo @-@ American love @-@ in quickly soured when the FDIC chairman was asked to give the same assurances of confidence in the British authorities .
according to the Financial Times , he &quot; laughingly declined . &quot;
indeed , while the FDIC and the BoE were working on their plan , the US Federal Reserve was developing proposals that will expose overseas banks in the US to a far tighter set of controls , and closer supervision , than they have hitherto experienced .
the Fed is seeking to oblige foreign banks to create a holding company to own their separately capitalized subsidiaries , effectively giving the Fed direct oversight of their business .
they will also be required to maintain stronger capital and liquidity positions in the US .
the justification offered for these new impositions is that overseas banks have moved beyond their traditional lending business to engage in substantial and often complex capital @-@ market activities .
&quot; the crisis revealed the resulting risks to US financial stability , &quot; said Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo .
the UK &apos;s Financial Services Authority has been invoking the same rationale for requiring foreign banks to establish local subsidiaries , rather than taking deposits or lending through a branch of the parent bank .
on the face of it , these moves appear to be well justified , given the mayhem created by poorly regulated banks in the major financial centers .
but we should be clear that these changes are not just tinkering at the edges .
they amount to a reversal of decades of policy by American and British regulators .
Ernest Patrikis , a former Fed supervisor , points to the clear implication that in the US domestic banks will have a strong advantage over foreign banks .
more dramatically , he asserts that &quot; subsidiarization would be the end of international banking . &quot;
Larry Fink , the CEO of the multinational investment @-@ management firm BlackRock , takes a similar view : &quot; it really throws into question &#91; the &#93; whole globalization of these firms , &quot; with &quot; each country for &#91; itself &#93; . &quot;
he adds : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t call it a trade war , but I would certainly call it a high level of protectionism . &quot;
one delicious irony in Europe is that Chinese banks are contesting the requirement to subsidiarize in London on precisely those grounds .
for now , high @-@ octane worries about protectionism are probably overdone .
and it is difficult to deny that the Fed should take a close interest in the funding strategies of foreign banks operating in the US .
another Fed governor , Jeremy Stein , has pointed out that foreign banks have dollar liabilities of roughly $ 8 trillion , much of it short @-@ term wholesale funding .
but there is a risk that these interventions are the thin end of a dangerous wedge .
forced subsidiarization causes capital and liquidity to be trapped in local legal entities , reducing the effectiveness with which that capital is used .
at a time when bank capital is scarce , that impediment carries significant economic costs .
moreover , tools that may be used wisely and well by institutions with a global outlook , like the Fed and the Bank of England , could take on a different character in countries where a commitment to free and open markets cannot be taken for granted .
so we must hope that the US and British authorities move carefully and do not use their new powers to freeze out foreign competition .
&quot; be careful what you wish for &quot; is wise advice in the regulatory world , as it is elsewhere .
will Next Time Be Different ?
Chicago - Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , in their excellent , eponymous book on debt crises , argue that the most dangerous words in any language are &quot; This time is different . &quot;
perhaps the next most dangerous words are &quot; Next time will be different . &quot;
these words are often uttered when politicians and central banks want to bail out some troubled segment of the economy .
&quot; yes , &quot; one can almost hear them saying , &quot; we understand that bailing out banks will subvert market discipline . but you cannot expect us to stand by and watch the system collapse , causing millions of innocent people to suffer .
we have to live with the hand we are dealt .
but next time will be different . &quot; they then use every tool they have to prevent economic losses on their watch .
the government &apos;s incentives are clear .
the public rewards them for dealing with the problem at hand - whether building levees to protect houses built on a flood plain or rescuing banks that have dodgy securities on their balance sheets .
politicians and central bankers gain little by letting the greedy or careless face the full consequences of their actions , for many innocent people would suffer as well .
a sympathetic press would amplify their heart @-@ rending stories of lost jobs and homes , making those counseling against intervention appear callous .
democracies are necessarily soft @-@ hearted , whereas markets and nature are not ; government inevitably expands to fill the gap .
to the extent that the rough justice meted out by markets or nature teaches anyone to behave better , it has consequences far beyond the horizon of anyone in power today .
when asked to choose between the risk of being known to posterity as the central banker who let the system collapse and the intangible future benefits of teaching risk takers a lesson , it does not take genius to predict the central banker &apos;s decision .
democracy tends to institutionalize moral hazard in sectors that are economically or politically important , such as finance or real estate , allowing them to privatize gains and socialize losses .
even though the authorities insist that the next time will be different , everyone knows that they will make the same decision when confronted with the same choice again .
so , knowing that next time will not be different , the authorities try their best to prevent a &quot; next time . &quot;
but risk takers have every incentive to try their luck again , knowing that , at worst , they will be bailed out .
in this cat @-@ and @-@ mouse game , risk takers have the upper hand .
for one thing , risk takers are typically small , cohesive interest groups that , once rescued , have a powerful incentive , as well as the resources , to buy the political influence needed to ensure a return to the status quo ante .
if risk takers were allowed to face more serious losses , they would have fewer resources to fight political attempts to constrain their risky activities .
moreover , the public does not have a long memory , a long time horizon , or an appetite for detail .
even as the United States &quot; voluminous Dodd @-@ Frank bill tried to ensure that bankers never subjected American taxpayers to undue risk again , public attention had moved on to the state of the real economy and unemployment .
why focus on financial regulation when the risks of an immediate collapse are small , and when the details are so tedious ?
as technical experts and lobbyists took over , and the public lost interest , Dodd @-@ Frank became friendlier and friendlier to the banks .
so how can this one @-@ way betting be stopped ?
the scary answer may be that it does not end until governments run out of money ( as in Ireland ) or the public runs out of sympathy ( as in Germany vis @-@ à @-@ vis the rest of Europe ) .
to avoid that fate , governments should start by recognizing that the system is programmed to respond to deep distress , and that they can do nothing about it .
but they must try to ensure that they do not destroy incentives by doing too much . and they must offset the distortions created by intervention in other ways .
for example , the US Federal Reserve has essentially guaranteed the financial sector that if it gets into trouble , ultra @-@ low interest rates will be maintained ( at the expense of savers ) until the sector recovers .
in the early to mid @-@ 1990 &quot; s , rates were kept low because of banks &quot; real @-@ estate problems .
they were slashed again in 2001 and kept ultra @-@ low after the dot @-@ com bust .
and they have been ultra @-@ low since 2008 .
senior Fed policymakers deny that their interest @-@ rate policy bears any responsibility for risk taking , but there is much evidence to the contrary .
it would be difficult for the Fed to respond differently if the financial sector gets into trouble again .
but it does not have to maintain ultra @-@ low interest rates after the crisis has passed , especially if those rates have little impact on generating sustainable economic activity .
doing so merely rewards banks for their past excesses - and taxes savers .
more importantly , if the Fed wants to restore incentives for risk takers and savers , it should offset the effects of staying &quot; low for long &quot; in bad times by increasing interest rates more rapidly than is strictly necessary as the economy recovers .
this will , of course , be politically difficult , because the public has been programmed to think that ultra @-@ low rates are good , and higher rates bad , for growth , without any consideration for the long @-@ term sustainability of growth .
finally , the pressure on governments to intervene would be lower if individuals had access to a minimum safety net .
official US policy is so activist in downturns ( regardless of its effectiveness ) partly because unemployment is so costly to workers - who have little savings , unemployment benefits that run out quickly , and health care that is often tied to a job .
a stronger safety net for individuals might allow politicians to accept more corporate or financial @-@ sector distress , and help bolster their claim that next time really will be different .
will Olmert Survive ?
after Israel &apos;s inability last summer to achieve a conclusive victory over Hezbollah in southern Lebanon , public pressure forced Prime Minister Ehud Olmert &apos;s government to appoint a commission to examine the causes of this surprising failure .
how could a small militia , numbering less than a few thousand combatants , survive the onslaught of the Middle East &apos;s most formidable military machine ?
the commission , headed by retired Supreme Court judge Eliyahu Winograd , has just published its interim report .
its criticism of Olmert , Defense Minister Amir Peretz , and Chief @-@ of @-@ Staff Dan Halutz - set forth in a detailed and meticulous 117 @-@ page assessment - is harsh , but not surprising .
the Winograd Commission articulated what most Israelis already think : Olmert and Peretz lacked the military , security , and policy experience to confront a terrorist organization that raided Israeli territory , killed a number of soldiers and kidnapped two , and then launched thousands of rockets on civilian targets for over a month .
indeed , the inexperience of the prime minister and the defense minister are unprecedented in Israel &apos;s history .
Olmert , who stepped into Ariel Sharon &apos;s shoes as leader of the new Kadima Party , was considered a competent but lackluster parliamentarian - and later mayor of Jerusalem - who was known more for his polemical style than for his political stature or gravitas .
for most Israelis , even those who voted for him as the bearer of Sharon &apos;s legacy after the Gaza disengagement , Olmert thus remained the accidental prime minister .
likewise , Peretz , a rabble @-@ rousing but effective trade unionist , surprised all when he won the Labor Party &apos;s leadership primary and then chose the defense portfolio over the treasury .
to many , the duo of Olmert and Peretz seemed to invite trouble .
precisely because Israelis are aware of the constant security threat facing their country , they have always believed that their leaders should be able to lead Israel in war - but also to ask the military tough questions when diplomacy may fail .
when such a moment arrived , totally out of the blue ( or so it seemed ) with Hezbollah &apos;s raid on July 12 , 2006 , Israel &apos;s two top politicians were completely out of their depth , stumbling into a war for which neither they nor the Israeli Army were prepared .
the military was led - for the first time in its history - by an Air Force general , Dan Halutz , who believed that everything could be solved by air power , creating a combustible combination of civilian ignorance and military arrogance .
in measured but devastating prose , the Winograd Commission gives failing marks to all three leaders .
Olmert decided to go into battle recklessly and unaware of the consequences .
Peretz was unable to gauge the strategic implications of his decisions .
and Halutz failed to present the civilian leadership with the full panoply of military options at the army &apos;s disposal .
Halutz already resigned a few months ago .
but both Olmert and Peretz have declared that , despite the Commission &apos;s conclusions , they would not quit : instead , they have vowed to implement the report &apos;s many far @-@ reaching substantive recommendations about policy , strategy , and decision @-@ making processes .
will Olmert and Peretz be able to stay on ?
their coalition government enjoys a comfortable parliamentary majority ; nor does the political arithmetic imply a viable parliamentary alternative .
but public opinion - volatile and angry - calls for both to resign : a public @-@ opinion poll conducted after the Commission published its report indicated that only 14 % of Israelis believe that Olmert should keep his job , while less than 11 % support Peretz .
later this week , demonstrations calling for the government &apos;s resignation are planned , and it will become obviously more difficult for the government to continue to function .
there are already rumors about a palace coup within Kadima , aimed at replacing Olmert with either the deputy prime minister , the veteran Shimon Peres , or the popular foreign minister , Tzipi Livni .
but it does not appear that Olmert will allow himself to be pushed out .
in fact , Olmert &apos;s weak and discredited government may yet survive .
if the government were to fall and new elections held , there are strong indications that the winner might be Binyamin Netanyahu , of the right @-@ wing Likud , which was decimated in the 2006 elections , but is now patiently waiting in the wings .
many who want Olmert to go would still not welcome a Netanyahu comeback , which may also explain what appears to be an indirect endorsement of Olmert by the United States .
only a strong Israeli government can make the painful decisions necessary for negotiations with the Palestinians to succeed .
as a result , the prospects for meaningful continuation of Israeli @-@ Palestinian talks look even dimmer than they did before .
indeed , the real loser of the 2006 Lebanon war was neither Israel nor Hezbollah , but , at least for the time being , the peace process .
will Rising Interest Rates torpedo Stock and House Prices ?
interest rates around the world are poised to rise .
short @-@ term rates have gone so low since the worldwide recession of 2001 - 1 % and 2 % , respectively , in the United States and the Eurozone , and practically zero in Japan - that a strengthening world economy will force central banks to tighten the monetary reins .
Australia &apos;s central bank has already been raising rates since May 2002 , and Great Britain &apos;s since November 2003 .
in the US , the two @-@ day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on June 29 @-@ 30 is likely to mark a major turning point , reversing the steady decline of the benchmark federal funds rate since Alan Greenspan began loosening monetary policy in 2001 .
this is likely to be followed by rate increases in China , the Eurozone , and elsewhere .
given the tendency of central banks to change interest rates gradually , any change of direction likely means more changes in the same direction later .
what will this landmark change mean for prices of such assets as stocks and homes ?
in theory , when interest rates go up , there is reason to believe that asset prices will go down .
the higher interest rates go , the better are investments in bonds , which compete with investments in other assets such as stocks or homes .
higher interest rates also raise the cost of borrowing to buy these assets , which may diminish demand for them , exerting downward pressure on their prices .
when interest rates fall , the opposite effect on asset prices may be predicted .
in fact , the history of the stock market &apos;s reactions to changing interest rates is mixed .
sometimes interest rate changes have the predicted effect , sometimes they don &apos;t .
for example , the NASDAQ stock price index made a spectacular 14 % jump upwards on the day ( January 3 , 2001 ) when America &apos;s Fed began its latest series of interest rate cuts .
a jump in the market is what one might have expected .
but then the NASDAQ index fell 22 % over the following year , although the Fed continued to cut interest rates aggressively .
does that experience suggest that the NASDAQ index will drop sharply if the Fed raises interest rates on June 30 ?
no .
the timing of the 2001 rate decrease stunned the market .
by contrast , the Fed is widely expected to raise rates at the end this month , so there will be no surprise element .
the market may know , not just from the experience of 2001 @-@ 2 , that interest rate movements do not have predictable effects on stock prices .
but , there are reasons to believe that higher interest rates , even though expected , can have a negative impact on home prices .
that is because home buyers are mostly ordinary people with little financial sophistication , unlike the professionals who trade in stocks .
untrained people with other things on their minds can make serious economic errors .
home values have soared to high levels in many countries as irrational exuberance grips the markets .
high home prices are already putting great stress on many families , which are struggling to make their mortgage payments .
when interest rates go up , these payments will ( when the rate is variable ) also go up , possibly becoming unsustainable .
if one borrows the equivalent of three years &apos; income to buy a house , a mortgage rate of 6 % means that 18 % of one &apos;s income goes to interest payments , which may be tolerable .
but if the rate rises to 8 % , mortgage interest payments rise to 24 % , which , together with amortization , taxes , other debts , and necessary expenditures , may claim too much of the family budget .
some will then try to sell their overpriced homes , and the resulting market imbalance will cause prices to fall .
people with fixed @-@ rate mortgages are also vulnerable to rate increases , though less directly .
this is because if they have to move and sell their house , there may be no buyers who can afford higher interest payments , unless the home &apos;s price also falls .
by contrast , sophisticated investors , such as big stock market players , are unlikely to fall prey to this trap .
but homebuyers are not as savvy , so they may not see the change coming or they may fail to plan for it .
as psychologists have shown , people are susceptible to &quot; wishful thinking bias , &quot; wishing away possible future problems that they would rather not think about .
they may overemphasize the likelihood of economic success ( &quot; I will be making a lot more money in a few years &quot; ) and underemphasize the commonplace problems that regularly challenge family budgets ( &quot; I will be losing my job or getting a divorce &quot; ) .
this blithe attitude is ultimately behind real estate bubbles where they are occurring .
low interest rates did not cause the bubbles .
they only made it easier for people , in those areas of the world where there is a half @-@ believable story about a fabulous future economy , to indulge their fantasies .
interest rate increases will deliver a fresh dose of reality : the interest expense of owning a home is going to claim a larger share of family budgets , a hard fact that will eventually sink into our thinking .
but declines in home prices will not occur quickly when central banks begin to raise interest rates .
after two years of rate increases , Australia &apos;s home price boom only recently shows signs of abating .
dominated by amateur investors , home markets do not turn on a dime .
in places where home prices have been rising rapidly , the upward trend may continue or level off for a while .
in most high @-@ priced places , a real decline may not come for some time .
will Russia Save the West ?
Moscow - Rapid changes in the global economy and international politics are raising , once more , an eternal issue in Russia : the country &apos;s relations with Europe , and with the Euro @-@ Atlantic region as a whole .
of course , Russia partly belongs to this region . yet it cannot and does not want to join the West wholeheartedly - at least not yet .
meanwhile , this choice looks very different now compared to just a few years ago .
it is becoming obvious that the Euro @-@ Atlantic world , whose economic and political model seemed so triumphant 20 years ago , is now lagging somewhat behind China and other Asian countries .
so is Russia , where , despite encouraging talk about innovation @-@ based development , the economy continues to de @-@ modernize as corruption has been allowed to metastasize , and as the country relies increasingly on its natural @-@ resource wealth .
indeed , it is Asia that has turned out to be the true winner of the Cold War .
these rising powers raise problems regarding Russia &apos;s geo @-@ strategic choices .
for the first time in decades , the values gap between Russia and the EU appears to be increasing .
Europe is overcoming state nationalism , while Russia is building a nation state .
broken by history and not wishing to be ravaged by war again , Europeans have embraced compromise and renounced the direct use of force in international relations .
Russians , on the other hand , emphasize their &quot; hard power , &quot; including military force , because they know that they live in a dangerous world and have no one to hide behind .
and , because of the country &apos;s comparative lack of &quot; soft power &quot; - social , cultural , and economic attractiveness - it stands ready to use the competitive advantages ( i.e. , its resource wealth ) available to it .
internal political developments in Russia are also pushing the country in a different direction from the West .
quite simply , Russia is moving away from democracy .
this emerging values gap is not an insurmountable obstacle to geostrategic rapprochement .
but , coupled with mutual irritation , which is particularly strong in Russia , closing the gap is becoming much harder .
for , while Russia &apos;s elite never considered itself defeated in the Cold War , the West essentially treated Russia as a defeated country - an attitude symbolized by NATO &apos;s eastward expansion , which laid a deep foundation for ongoing tension .
it was only after the West encountered an armed rebuff in South Ossetia that NATO expansion was stopped in its tracks .
yet NATO has not given up on further enlargement .
NATO expansion is nothing more than the extension of its zone of influence - and in the most sensitive , military @-@ political sphere .
and yet the West &apos;s unwillingness to abandon that effort is coupled with a repeated refusal to recognize Russia &apos;s right to have its own zone of interest .
so NATO expansion has left the Cold War unfinished . the ideological and military confrontation that underlay it is gone , but the geopolitical rivalry that it entailed has returned to the fore .
thus , the old mentality survived on both sides .
energy debates are another example of this .
non @-@ Russian Europe should thank the Almighty for the presence of energy @-@ rich Russia at its borders , while Russia should be thankful for having such wealthy customers .
but the natural differences in the interests of energy consumers and producers have been given a political / security twist - witness the discussions about an &quot; Energy NATO . &quot;
faced with the impossibility of advantageous accession to Euro @-@ Atlantic institutions , Russia is drifting fast towards alignment with China - a &quot; younger brother , &quot; though a respected one .
Russia &apos;s &quot; Asian choice &quot; of today is not the same as the Slavophile / Eurasian choice of the past .
on the surface , it looks like a choice in favor of a rapidly rising civilization . but the current estrangement from Europe - the cradle of Russian civilization and modernization - threatens Russia &apos;s identity and will increase its geostrategic risks in the future .
Europe does not benefit from this estrangement either .
it will continue to move towards beautiful decay - Venice writ large .
the United States also loses . without Russia , which will remain the world &apos;s third strongest power for the foreseeable future , it is impossible to solve the key problems of international security .
the current Euro @-@ Atlantic security architecture seems to suit the majority of Americans and Europeans , though it is becoming increasingly fragile and counterproductive.So Russia will struggle to create a new architecture largely on its own - whether through a new treaty on collective European security , or even through its accession to NATO .
this is not only in Russian political and civilizational interest , but it also reflects our duty to the entire community of Euro @-@ Atlantic nations , which is being weakened by the &quot; unfinished Cold War . &quot;
the idea of a &quot; Union of Europe &quot; between Russia and the EU should be put on the long @-@ term agenda .
that Union should be based on a common human , economic , and energy space .
the combination of a new security arrangement for the Euro @-@ Atlantic community and the establishment of the Union of Europe could arrest the decline in the international weight of the West .
will Success spoil Brazil ?
Rio DE JANEIRO - Brazil has been making international headlines of late , but not for traditional stories about urban violence , natural catastrophes , political corruption , or deforestation in the Amazon .
at the G @-@ 20 Summit in London last April , for example , US President Barack Obama called for the world to pay heed to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , the &quot; most popular politician on earth , &quot; and shook hands with him , saying : &quot; my man right here .
I love this guy . &quot;
in September , the ousted president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , reappeared in the country inside the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa after three months of exile .
although his presence dramatically fuelled the situation for a time , Brazilian diplomats , working with the US , were able to reach agreement with Honduran authorities to allow Manuel Zelaya to return to office .
then came the news that Brazil will host the 2016 Summer Olympic Games - this coming on top of hosting the 2014 World Cup .
as for the global - and fortunately now abating - economic crisis , Brazil has shined throughout , recording a fast and strong recovery .
and , as if this good news were not enough , Brazil &apos;s giant state oil company , Petrobrás , is already at work developing two huge deep @-@ water oil fields discovered in the sea off the coast of Rio de Janeiro .
for these and other reasons , Brazil is gaining the world &apos;s attention .
Brazilian democracy , at long last , is working well , following many years of military government , and its economy seems more robust than ever .
as a result , many people are enthusiastically pointing to an increased international role for Brazil in the future .
but two connected and major challenges lie ahead for Brazil and its government : the need to build a far more equal society and to resist the temptation to use nationalism to mask whatever domestic failures may manifest themselves .
Brazil &apos;s current success is rooted not only in Lula &apos;s two terms , which must end in 2010 .
the economic stabilization program enacted by Fernando Henrique Cardoso since 1994 ( the Real Plan ) , first as finance minister and then as president for two terms , solidified a structure that made it possible for Lula &apos;s tenure to be so prosperous .
this is not meant to take anything away from Lula .
his presidency has guaranteed political stability and strengthened social cohesion .
indeed , by managing the political process to make the government work for Brazil &apos;s people , Lula &apos;s administration has made Brazil a truly stable and consensual democracy .
there is nothing modest about that achievement , given Brazil &apos;s traditional institutional instability and the series of major corruption scandals that engulfed Lula &apos;s government in 2005 and 2006 .
Lula survived those scandals and did not move to amend the constitution in order to seek a third term , though some in Brazil pressed him to do so .
Lula also enacted critically important social policies .
under his government , two million homes received electric power for the first time , 11 million very poor families gained the support of a minimum income ( the Bolsa Família ) , the minimum salary grew 45 % in real terms , thus benefiting 42 million people .
moreover , eight million jobs were created , 17 million people escaped poverty , and the income of the poorest 50 % grew 32 % - twice as fast as the income of the richest 10 % in the same period .
and Lula achieved all this without triggering inflation , which he knows - perhaps a result of his own impoverished childhood - wreaks havoc on the poor most of all .
this vast transformation has not only generated a virtuous circle that strengthened institutional stability and social capital . it has also differentiated Brazil from other countries in Latin America , putting the country in the forefront in the region in terms of dealing with traditional social and economic injustices in a democratic way .
yet the remaining challenges are huge , for Brazil remains the seventh most unequal society in the world - and severe violence persists .
sixty @-@ four percent of Brazilian homes lack electricity and sanitation , and only 22 % have electricity , a telephone , a computer , a refrigerator , a television , and a washing machine .
in the poorest region , the North and Northeast , the numbers fall to 8.6 % and 8.3 % .
among the young , almost 37 % of 18 @-@ 24 @-@ year @-@ olds do not finish high school .
only half the population over age 25 has more than eight years of formal education .
as for Brazil &apos;s international role , a subtle competition is emerging with the US .
America wants to conclude as many free @-@ trade agreements in the region as it can , while Brazil favors expanding its custom union , Mercosul / Mercosur .
the entrance of Venezuela into the Brazilian bloc , Brazilian leadership at the United Nations mission in Haiti , and Brazil &apos;s role in the Honduran affair are all part of this emerging competition .
if Brazil is to remain on its prosperous path , it must continue to give higher priority to its social and economic programs than to foreign adventures .
the construction of a major egalitarian , free , and democratic society that respects and works with the international institutions is the best thing that Brazil can give to the world right now .
will Technology Kill Convergence ?
Washington , DC - At last week &apos;s annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Lima , Peru , one topic that dominated discussions was the slowdown in emerging @-@ economy growth .
hailed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis as the new engines of the world economy , the emerging economies are now acting as a drag on global growth , and many argue that their era of rapid expansion - and their quest to achieve convergence with advanced @-@ country income levels - is over .
are the doomsayers right ?
there is certainly reason for concern - beginning in China .
after decades of nearly double @-@ digit growth , China appears to be experiencing a marked slowdown - one that some argue is actually worse than official statistics indicate .
as China &apos;s growth slows , so does its demand for oil and commodities , with severe effects for other emerging economies that depend on commodity exports .
moreover , the benefits of lower commodity prices do not seem to have materialized among net importers , except perhaps India ; if they have , they have been far from adequate to offset other growth @-@ damaging forces .
meanwhile , the advanced economies are tentatively recovering from the 2008 crisis .
as a result , the differential between growth in the emerging and advanced economies - aggregated from IMF data , and including Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea , and Taiwan in the emerging group - has declined considerably .
indeed , after averaging three percentage points for two decades and rising to 4.8 percentage points in 2010 , the percentage @-@ point differential fell to 2.5 last year and is expected to amount to just 1.5 this year .
the question , then , is whether the growth differential will remain as low at it is today .
those who believe that it will , typically rely on three arguments , all of which require some qualification .
first , they argue that much convergence has already taken place in manufacturing .
this is true , but it neglects the increasing interconnectedness of manufacturing and services , and the changing nature of many services .
an iPad , for example , must not just be built ; it also needs coding services .
in a sense , it is actually more the product of the modern services sector than of manufacturing .
and there are plenty of untapped opportunities for technological catch @-@ up in , say , health , education , and financial services .
second , emerging @-@ market bears point out that these economies have gained major productivity benefits from the migration of surplus rural labor to urban areas , a surplus that will soon be exhausted .
this , too , is true .
but it ignores the fact that there still is a huge reservoir of urban labor in the informal sector that , upon shifting to the formal sector , would provide an additional boost to productivity .
the pessimists &quot; third argument is that emerging economies are not implementing fast enough the structural reforms needed to support long @-@ term growth .
again , there is some truth to this argument : structural reforms are needed everywhere .
but there is no proven way to measure the pace of their implementation .
as a result , it is difficult to argue that the emerging economies have collectively slowed in their structural @-@ reform efforts .
but there may be a fourth mechanism at work , related to the changing - and seriously disruptive - nature of new technologies .
a major driver of past catch @-@ up , if only in terms of incremental growth , was the shift of many activities in both the services and manufacturing sectors from advanced economies to developing countries with lower wages .
now , however , a growing array of activities can be automated .
and coding @-@ supported products often have lower costs per unit of output than even very cheap labor can provide .
so , whereas call centers , for example , used to be mostly staffed in low @-@ wage countries , now the computer @-@ robot that does most of the talking can be located in New York .
that observation should not , however , overshadow fundamental economic insights - specifically , that trade and the location of production are determined by comparative , not absolute , advantage .
a country will always have a comparative advantage in something ; but that something changes .
many advanced countries , for example , now have a comparative advantage in high @-@ value @-@ added activities .
in other words , thanks to their highly skilled labor forces , they are better equipped than their developing @-@ country counterparts for activities like the production of made @-@ to @-@ measure specialized goods or , indeed , anything that requires a highly trained team to work in close proximity .
but the technology @-@ induced shifts that are underway could portend big disruptions in global value chains - disruptions affecting both developed and developing countries .
in fact , we may have entered a period of fundamental change that could weaken growth everywhere , as the &quot; old &quot; shrinks before the &quot; new &quot; can occupy sufficient space .
to be sure , the creative destruction that is taking place seems to be affecting developing @-@ economy growth proportionately more than advanced @-@ economy growth , largely because the new technologies are being put to work where they were invented , and developing countries have not yet managed sufficient imitation .
but I am not convinced that &quot; catch @-@ up &quot; opportunities will remain diminished - not least because it will always be easier to imitate than to invent .
in fact , it could be argued that new &quot; leap @-@ frogging &quot; may become possible .
as experience in the telecommunications sector shows , the ability to adopt new technologies without first having to dismantle old systems can enable rapid progress .
the key to enabling continued convergence - even at a fairly rapid pace - is good political governance .
developing @-@ country governments must implement policies aimed at managing the impending transformation , while maintaining social solidarity and cohesion .
that is the challenge they must meet at this time of great disruption .
will the EU Keep Faith with Turkey ?
embargo 6 September 2004
more than forty years ago , Turkey applied for associate membership of the European Economic Community .
with the Association agreement of 1963 , a special relationship was established , culminating in the customs union of 1996 .
during all these years , European governments consistently confirmed Turkey &apos;s eligibility for full membership , making accession dependent on compliance with membership criteria .
Turkey &apos;s formal recognition as a candidate state in 1999 led Turkey to undertake unprecedented reform efforts in the area of human and minority rights , including abolition of the death penalty , safeguards against torture , promotion of religious freedoms , gender equality , and restriction of the military &apos;s role in political life .
should the EU consider the accession criteria as having been fulfilled , it must decide to open negotiations in early 2005 .
not to do so would mean to renege on political commitments and to severely damage the EU &apos;s credibility in the world .
in many parts of Europe , however , Turkey &apos;s admission to the EU is viewed with skepticism owing to its size , relatively poor economy , fears of massive immigration , and , above all , cultural and societal differences - a euphemism for Islam . it would be foolish to deny that some of these factors represent serious challenges .
however , they are often exaggerated and certainly not insurmountable .
negotiations with Turkey would be lengthy and accession may not occur before 2015 .
this period of time would offer both Turkey and the Union an opportunity to come to terms .
with 80 million people , Turkey would be one of the largest EU states .
but the size of a country plays only a limited role in the EU &apos;s decision @-@ making process , because political influence within the Union depends more on economic power .
moreover , for decades Turkey has been a responsible member of many European institutions , and there is no reason to believe that it would act differently in the EU .
because of its weak economy , Turkey would be eligible for substantial EU assistance .
the size of these transfers , however , would depend on the EU &apos;s financial policies at the time of admission , the outcome of accession negotiations , and economic developments in Turkey .
in any case , the EU &apos;s practice of &quot; capping &quot; its budget would prevent an explosion in the financial costs entailed by Turkey &apos;s accession .
immigration should not be a cause for undue concern , either .
human mobility is limited , and Turkey workers &apos; would probably be allowed to move freely within the EU only after a long transition period , possibly not before 2025 .
given the expected upswing of Turkey &apos;s economy and its declining birthrate , experts predict a figure of around 2.7 million immigrants by that point .
meanwhile , diminishing and aging populations in most of Europe will have made immigration a necessity .
among the countries from where immigration to the EU is probable , Turkey has the best prospects for successful adaptation .
it is Turkey &apos;s Muslim population that creates the strongest emotions .
many feel that Turkey simply does not fit into a European society based on Christian traditions and culture .
it is also feared that Islamists may one day turn Turkey into a fundamentalist state .
unlikely as it may be in view of Turkey &apos;s deeply rooted secularism , such a risk cannot be totally excluded .
but the same is true for any other democracy , where radical groups could well misuse the democratic process for their purposes .
surely , the best protection against such a calamity is to strengthen Turkey &apos;s democratic system , which can best be achieved by anchoring it firmly in a bloc of similarly democratic countries .
as for the EU , it must decide whether it wants to be a closed &quot; Christian club &quot; or an open and inclusive society , drawing strength from cultural and religious diversity .
Turkey &apos;s accession to the Union would give a powerful answer , one that would be heard with particular clarity in the Islamic world .
the need to refute arguments against Turkey &apos;s admission to the EU leaves the advantages rarely mentioned : its unique geopolitical position at the crossroads of the Balkans , Southern Caucasus , Central Asia , and the Middle East - vitally important regions for Europe &apos;s security ; its role as mayor transit country for energy supplies ; its military capabilities at a time when the EU is developing its new European Defense Policy ; and the great potential of the Turkish economy , with its young and dynamic labor force .
at the same time , the risks of rejecting Turkey must also be taken into account : the likelihood that the reform process would collapse , bringing radical currents to the fore and leading to instability and political unrest at the EU &apos;s doorsteps .
Turkish EU membership presents both opportunities and challenges .
on balance , however , the advantages far outweigh the risks .
will the Euro dethrone the Dollar ?
much of America &apos;s dominance in world finance comes from the dollar &apos;s status as international money .
America &apos;s commitment to free capital markets , the rule of law , and price stability confer credibility on the dollar as a store of value .
but American spending habits have undermined the dollar &apos;s reputation , with the excess supply of dollars on world markets depressing its price .
this spring , the euro &apos;s exchange rate against the dollar reached an all @-@ time high , and central banks have increased the euro share of their international reserves .
is the dollar about to lose the crown of world finance to the euro ?
history suggests otherwise , despite a vulnerable dollar .
American financial supremacy in the twenty @-@ first century resembles Britain &apos;s position in world finance a century ago .
before the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the pound sterling served as the currency of choice for international transactions , just as the dollar does today , and the world &apos;s borrowers visited the City of London to raise capital .
the British economist John Maynard Keynes worried that countries would not use sterling to settle trading balances with each other if the pound were not viewed as a reliable store of value .
the &quot; future position of the City of London , &quot; according to Keynes , depended on the pound sterling continuing to serve the business world as the equivalent of gold .
Britain maintained the pound &apos;s convertibility into gold at the outbreak of the Great War to preserve its credibility as the international medium of exchange .
the dollar could not challenge sterling &apos;s role as the world &apos;s currency without matching its reputation .
August 1914 provided the opportunity .
the biggest gold outflow in a generation imperiled America &apos;s ability to repay its debts abroad .
fear that the US would abandon the gold standard sent the dollar plummeting on world markets .
but Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo secured American financial honor in August 1914 by remaining true to gold while everyone else , except for the British , abandoned their obligations .
despite the dollar &apos;s instant credibility , however , it took more than a decade for America &apos;s currency to match Britain &apos;s as an international medium of exchange .
payment habits melt at a glacier &apos;s pace .
Britain &apos;s transformation from international creditor to international debtor during the Great War gave the dollar a second wind in its battle with sterling .
the British were forced to abandon gold convertibility in April 1919 - a tactical withdrawal intended to pave the way for Britain &apos;s return to the former $ 4.8665 parity with the American dollar .
six years later , in April 1925 , Britain confirmed its monetary credibility and returned to the gold standard .
but the pound had already suffered irreparable damage .
the experience of 1914 implies that a credible alternative can replace an entrenched world currency , especially after an unfavorable balance of trade has weakened it .
but even then , dethroning the reigning king of international exchange takes time .
today , the euro - a currency without a country - lacks a long track record of credibility .
thirteen countries in the European Union use the euro as money .
but the commitment of these independent political entities to the euro cannot match the history of America &apos;s commitment to the dollar .
the European Central Bank , established in 1998 , has a mandate to manage the new currency to maintain price stability .
but the ECB needs time to establish its inflation @-@ fighting credentials .
it cannot hitch a ride on gold , the way America did a century ago .
so the euro must earn its reputation crisis by crisis to confront the dollar &apos;s dominance as the currency of choice for international transactions .
recent experience with the euro as an official reserve asset is instructive .
between 2000 and 2005 , the dollar lost more than 25 % of its value against the euro .
meanwhile , the fraction of international reserves held in euros grew from 18 % to 24 % , and the dollar &apos;s share dropped from 71 % to 66 % .
in short , the euro has clearly made some headway during this period of US balance of payment deficits , but this reflects an evolutionary decline in the dollar &apos;s dominance , not a revolutionary regime shift .
what might trigger a fatal run on the dollar in world markets ?
while a broad and abrupt sell @-@ off by major foreign holders of dollars - for example , China - appears unlikely , a cataclysmic event , similar to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914 , could prompt a search for a new international medium of exchange .
in the modern era of automated payments , the upheaval might come from a terrorist attack that undermines the computerized transfer facilities of the world &apos;s banking system .
a catastrophic loss of electronic records could surely destroy the credibility of the dollar as the international medium of exchange .
but exactly what would replace the dollar under such circumstances remains an open question .
after all , a loss of computer records would make the euro equally suspect .
perhaps gold , a store of value impervious to physical distortion , could make a comeback .
of course , one can only hope that such a scenario remains pure conjecture .
will the Euro Survive the Current Crisis ?
Cambridge - The European Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) and the euro are about to celebrate their tenth anniversary .
the euro was introduced without serious problems and has since functioned well , with the European Central Bank delivering the low inflation that is its sole mandate .
but the current economic crisis may provide a severe test of the euro &apos;s ability to survive in more troubled times .
while the crisis could strengthen the institutions provided by the EMU , it could also create multiple risks , of which member countries need to be aware if they want to avoid them .
the primary problem is that conditions in individual EMU members may develop in such different ways that some national political leaders could be tempted to conclude that their countries would be better served by adopting a mix of policies different from that of the other members .
the current differences in the interest rates of euro @-@ zone government bonds show that the financial markets regard a break @-@ up as a real possibility .
ten @-@ year government bonds in Greece and Ireland , for example , now pay nearly a full percentage point above the rate on comparable German bonds , and Italy &apos;s rate is almost as high .
there have , of course , been many examples in history in which currency unions or single @-@ currency states have broken up .
although there are technical and legal reasons why such a split would be harder for an EMU country , there seems little doubt that a country could withdraw if it really wanted to .
the most obvious reason that a country might choose to withdraw is to escape from the one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all monetary policy imposed by the single currency .
a country that finds its economy very depressed during the next few years , and fears that this will be chronic , might be tempted to leave the EMU in order to ease monetary conditions and devalue its currency .
although that may or may not be economically sensible , a country in a severe economic downturn might very well take such a policy decision .
the Stability and Growth Pact , which limits euro @-@ zone members &quot; fiscal deficits , is another reason why a country might want to leave the EMU .
in a serious downturn , a country may wish to pursue a traditional Keynesian policy through large @-@ scale , deficit @-@ financed fiscal stimulus .
although the Stability and Growth Pact may be elastic enough to permit some deficit stimulus , a country may feel constrained from acting as aggressively as it wants .
the current financial crisis raises yet another problem : the lack of a clear &quot; lender of last resort . &quot;
it remains to be seen how willing the ECB will be to provide national central banks with the volume of euros needed to play this role fully .
if a country sees its banks failing because its national bank cannot lend them enough , it may chose to leave the EMU so that its central bank can provide whatever amount of local currency it deems necessary .
moreover , the current economic crisis has led to renewed talk about the need for the European Union to have taxing authority .
whatever the logic of that proposition , it would open the door to much greater income redistribution .
high @-@ income countries might find that reason enough to want out .
even if officials do not want to abandon the euro , they may come to do so as a result of a strategy of trying to get other countries to agree to a policy change .
a country that believes that monetary or fiscal policy is too tight may threaten to leave if policy is not changed .
that is clearly a substantial risk if the country is Germany or France .
but even if it is one of the smaller countries , it might be a serious threat because it could be seen as the beginning of the end .
so either type of country could make the threat in the hope that it would be enough to cause their EMU colleagues to agree to their desired change in policy .
the risk , of course , is that the other countries may not be intimidated .
the threatening country would then have to choose whether to accepting a humiliating defeat and stay , or stand on &quot; principle &quot; and leave .
all of this assumes that political leaders would select only a policy change that they think will be in their nation &apos;s long @-@ term interest .
but there is also a risk that some politicians act solely out of self @-@ interest , seizing on the economic downturn as an opportunity to get elected by promising to withdraw the country from the EMU , or by saying that they will threaten to do so if the other member countries do not agree to their proposed policy changes .
none of these risks implies that the monetary union will inevitably be a victim of this severe economic downturn .
but the downturn will be a more severe test for the euro than any that it faced during its first ten years .
will the IMF Stand Up to Europe ?
Cambridge - As the eurozone crisis continues to deepen , the International Monetary Fund may finally be acknowledging the need to reassess its approach .
new Managing Director Christine Lagarde &apos;s recent call for forced recapitalization of Europe &apos;s bankrupt banking system is a good start .
European officials &quot; incensed reaction - the banks are fine , they insist , and need only liquidity support - should serve to buttress the Fund &apos;s determination to be sensible about Europe .
until now , the Fund has sycophantically supported each new European initiative to rescue the over @-@ indebted eurozone periphery , committing more than $ 100 billion to Greece , Portugal , and Ireland so far .
unfortunately , the IMF is risking not only its members &quot; money , but , ultimately , its own institutional credibility .
only a year ago , at the IMF &apos;s annual meeting in Washington , DC , senior staff were telling anyone who would listen that the whole European sovereign @-@ debt panic was a tempest in a teapot .
using slick PowerPoint presentations with titles like &quot; Default in Today &apos;s Advanced Economies : unnecessary , Undesirable , and Unlikely , &quot; the Fund tried to convince investors that eurozone debt was solid as a rock .
even for Greece , the IMF argued , debt dynamics were not a serious concern , thanks to anticipated growth and reforms .
never mind the obvious flaw in the Fund &apos;s logic , namely that countries such as Greece and Portugal face policy and implementation risks far more akin to emerging markets than to truly advanced economies such as Germany and the United States .
as the situation deteriorated , one might have guessed that the IMF would mark its beliefs to market , as it were , and adopt a more cautious tone .
instead , at the IMF &apos;s April 2011 interim meeting , a senior official declared that the Fund now considers troubled Spain to be a core eurozone country like Germany , rather than a peripheral country like Greece , Portugal , or Ireland .
evidently , investors were supposed to infer that for all practical purposes they should think of Spanish and German debt as identical - the old hubris of the eurozone .
my own sarcastic reaction was to think , &quot; Oh , now the IMF thinks that some of the core eurozone countries are a default risk . &quot;
having served as the IMF &apos;s chief economist from 2001 to 2003 , I am familiar with the Fund &apos;s need to walk a tightrope between building investor confidence and shaking up complacent policymakers .
but it is one thing to be circumspect in the midst of a crisis ; it is quite another to spew nonsense .
the late Chicago @-@ school economist George Stigler would have described the IMF &apos;s role in Europe as reflecting acute &quot; regulatory capture . &quot;
simply put , Europe and the US control too much power in the IMF , and their thinking is too dominant .
what European leaders may want most from the Fund are easy loans and strong rhetorical support .
but what Europe really needs is the kind of honest assessment and tough love that the Fund has traditionally offered to its other , less politically influential , clients .
the IMF &apos;s blind spot in dealing with Europe until now is only partly due to European voting power .
it also stems from an &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them &quot; mentality that similarly permeates research at the top Wall Street investment houses .
analysts who have worked their entire lives only on advanced economies have learned to bet on things going well , because for the couple of decades prior to the crisis , things mostly did go well - very well .
that is why , for example , so many keep assuming that a normal rapid recovery is just around the corner .
but the financial crisis should have reminded everyone that the distinction between advanced economies and emerging markets is not a bright red line .
in his recent speech in Jackson Hole , Wyoming , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke forcefully complained that political paralysis has possibly become the principal impediment to recovery .
but analysts accustomed to working on emerging markets understand that such paralysis is very difficult to avoid after a financial crisis .
rather than slavishly believing policymakers &quot; assurances , emerging @-@ market researchers have learned to be cynical about official promises .
all too often , everything that can be done wrong will be done wrong .
the IMF needs to bring much more of this brand of skepticism to its assessment of eurozone debt dynamics , instead of constantly seeking strained assumptions that would make the debt appear sustainable .
anyone looking closely at Europe &apos;s complex options for extricating itself from its debt straightjacket should realize that political constraints will be a huge obstacle no matter which route Europe takes .
even outside Europe , the IMF has long given too much credence to sitting governments , rather than focusing on the long @-@ term interests of the country and its people .
the Fund is doing Europe &apos;s people no favor by failing to push aggressively for a more realistic solution , including dramatic debt write @-@ downs for peripheral eurozone countries and re @-@ allocating core @-@ country guarantees elsewhere .
now that the Fund has squarely acknowledged the huge capital holes in many European banks , it should start pressing forcefully for a comprehensive and credible solution to the eurozone debt crisis , a solution that will involve either partial breakup of the eurozone or fundamental constitutional reform .
Europe &apos;s future , not to mention the future of the IMF , depends on it .
will the Polluters Pay for Climate Change ?
I am writing this in New York in early August , when the mayor declared a &quot; heat emergency &quot; to prevent widespread electricity outages from the expected high use of air conditioners .
city employees could face criminal charges if they set their thermostats below 78 degrees Fahrenheit ( 25.5 Celsius ) .
nevertheless , electricity usage has reached near @-@ record levels .
meanwhile California has emerged from its own record @-@ breaking heat wave .
for the United States as a whole , the first six months of 2006 were the hottest in more than a century .
Europe is experiencing an unusually hot summer , too .
July set new records in England and the Netherlands , where weather data go back more than 300 years .
the hot northern summer fits well with the release of An Inconvenient Truth , a documentary film featuring former US Vice @-@ President Al Gore .
using some remarkable graphs , images , and other information , the film makes a compelling case that our carbon dioxide emissions are causing global warming , or , at the very least , contributing to it , and that we must urgently address the issue .
Americans tend to talk a lot about morality and justice .
but most Americans still fail to realize that their country &apos;s refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol , and their subsequent business @-@ as @-@ usual approach to greenhouse gas emissions , is a moral failing of the most serious kind .
it is already having harmful consequences for others , and the greatest inequity is that it is the rich who are using most of the energy that leads to the emissions that cause climate change , while it is the poor who will bear most of the costs .
( to see what you can do to reduce your own contribution , go to www.climatecrisis.net. )
to see the inequity , I merely have to glance up at the air conditioner that is keeping my office bearable .
while I &apos;ve done more than the mayor requested , setting it at 82F ( 27C ) , I &apos;m still part of a feedback loop .
I deal with the heat by using more energy , which leads to burning more fossil fuel , putting more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and heating up the planet more .
it even happened when I watched An Inconvenient Truth : on a warm evening , the cinema was so chilly that I wished I had brought a jacket .
heat kills .
a heat wave in France in 2003 caused an estimated 35,000 deaths , and a hot spell similar to the one Britain had last month caused more than 2,000 deaths , according to official estimates .
although no particular heat wave can be directly attributed to global warming , it will make such events more frequent .
moreover , if global warming continues unchecked , the number of deaths that occur when rainfall becomes more erratic , causing both prolonged droughts and severe floods , will dwarf the death toll from hot weather in Europe .
more frequent intense hurricanes will kill many more .
melting polar ice will cause rising seas to inundate low @-@ lying fertile delta regions on which hundreds of millions of people grow their food .
tropical diseases will spread , killing still more people .
overwhelmingly , the dead will be those who lack the resources to adapt , to find alternative sources of food , and who do not have access to health care .
even in rich countries , it usually isn &apos;t the rich who die in natural disasters .
when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans , those who died were the poor in low @-@ lying areas who lacked cars to escape .
if this is true in a country like the US , with a reasonably efficient infrastructure and the resources to help its citizens in times of crisis , it is even more evident when disasters strike developing countries , because their governments lack the resources needed , and because , when it comes to foreign assistance , rich nations still do not count all human lives equally .
according to United Nations figures , in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the US were 16 times higher than in India , 60 times higher than in Bangladesh , and more than 200 times higher than in Ethiopia , Mali , or Chad .
other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australia , Canada , and Luxembourg .
Russia , Germany , Britain , Italy , France , and Spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the US .
this is still significantly above the world average , and more than 50 times that of the poorest nations in which people will die from global warming .
if a polluter harms others , those who are harmed normally have a legal remedy .
for example , if a factory leaks toxic chemicals into a river that I use to irrigate my farm , killing my crops , I can sue the factory owner .
if the rich nations pollute the atmosphere with carbon dioxide , causing my crops to fail because of changing rainfall patterns , or my fields are inundated by a rise in the sea level , shouldn &apos;t I also be able to sue ?
Camilla Toulmin , who directs the International Institute for Environment and Development , a London @-@ based NGO , was present at a lecture on climate change that Al Gore gave in June .
she asked him what he thought about compensation for those who are hit hardest by climate change , but who have done the least to cause it .
the question , she reports on www.opendemocracy.net , seemed to take him by surprise , and he did not support the idea .
like Toulmin , I wonder if this is a truth that is just too inconvenient , even for him .
will the Rumsfeld Revolution Continue ?
America &apos;s defense policy is at a crossroads .
since 1997 , the United States Congress has required the Department of Defense to undertake a major defense review every four years .
the department is currently developing the third such review and will release it later this year .
the review promises to be nothing short of a watershed .
the last Quadrennial Defense Review was published a few weeks after the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
as a result , it gave only hints of the counterterrorism strategy to come .
the 2005 review , by contrast , will represent several years of thinking by the Bush administration , and thus will serve as a key indicator of the future course of American defense policy .
the grand strategy that serves as the foundation for American defense policy has not undergone major change since 2002 .
focusing on terrorism , the strategy calls for strengthening the network of international partners seeking to eradicate transnational terrorism , and for direct action against terrorist organizations and their sponsors .
ultimately , it seeks to address what President Bush considers the root causes of terrorism , particularly the absence of open political systems and economic opportunity .
what is changing is the way that US military power is used to implement this grand strategy .
there is little doubt that the 2005 Defense Review will formalize the change in focus underway since September 11 , 2001 .
before that , the American military concentrated on swift victory in a major theater war against another state &apos;s military forces .
today , however , the US military is more likely to be used to stabilize and rebuild failed states , assist partners in countering insurgency and terrorism , control nuclear weapons when regimes collapse , or directly eradicate terrorist organizations and their supporters .
this requires a different type of force , and one capable of running a marathon rather than a sprint , sustaining major deployments for extended periods .
the global configuration of America &apos;s military is also changing .
the goal is to keep most of the force stationed at home in the US , with a network of lightly @-@ manned bases abroad that can serve as forward operating locations during a crisis or war .
rather than being miniature Americas , many of these bases will be operated in conjunction with or by the host nation .
this will capitalize on the US military &apos;s ability to project force around the world quickly , while providing a more flexible and politically palatable way of doing so .
but , beyond the ongoing changes , major strategic questions persist .
first , how much conventional war @-@ fighting capability should the US military retain ?
the goal is to maintain enough to deter aggressors , but not so much that it detracts from other , more likely missions .
second , what will America &apos;s relationship with its traditional allies be ?
will formal alliances such as NATO remain the centerpiece of American strategy , or will they be superseded by mission @-@ specific coalitions ?
third , how much should the US continue to invest in advanced , high @-@ tech weapons more appropriate for conventional enemies than for fighting terrorists or insurgents ?
systems such as the F / A @-@ 22 Raptor aircraft and the Army &apos;s Future Combat System are extraordinarily expensive .
at a time when deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan are straining the defense budget and much of the military &apos;s existing equipment needs repair or replacement , questions arise as to whether such programs are a good investment .
fourth , what is the appropriate size of the US military ?
many defense intellectuals , former military leaders , and politicians believe that America &apos;s military , particularly the ground forces , are too small to implement Bush &apos;s grand strategy .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , on the other hand , believes the size of the military is adequate if it is re @-@ organized for maximum efficiency .
he is also concerned that an increase in the size of the military will diminish funds available for advanced technology and systems .
because Rumsfeld is the primary architect of the upcoming defense review , it is very unlikely to recommend an increase in the size of the force .
the changes underway in American defense policy reflect planning assumptions .
the strategy that emerges will be only as strong as these assumptions are accurate .
the upcoming defense review will mandate changes based on events of the past five years , focusing especially on Iraq , Afghanistan , and other aspects of the war on terror .
the question is whether future American military missions will replicate those of the past five years .
if not , the US might be preparing for the last war rather than the next one .
one hopes that the 2005 Defense Review will address this issue , although it is certain to answer some strategic questions and leave others open to continued debate .
in any case , the new review will serve as a roadmap for future US defense policy , thus affecting America &apos;s partners and adversaries alike .
will the Sun Still Rise ?
Tokyo - The scale of the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in March was far greater than even the authorities &quot; worst scenarios foresaw .
nearly six months later , the total damage remains difficult to estimate .
social unrest and confusion , as well as radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear power plant , continue .
and now the country has absorbed another huge blow : another downgrade of its bond ratings . both Moody &apos;s and Standard &amp; Poor &apos;s now rate Japanese bonds at only their fourth @-@ highest level .
so what policies should be implemented in response to these economic blows ?
last year , Japan &apos;s economy grew at a relatively healthy 3 % annual rate , higher than in the United States or the European Union , owing mainly to the fiscal expansion undertaken after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 .
but growth in 2011 had been predicted to slow even before the earthquake .
indeed , the economy shrank by 3.5 % year on year in the first quarter .
now , with so much fixed capital and infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami , the economy &apos;s productive capacity has fallen by an estimated 2 % of GDP .
but that may not be a bad thing : prior to the earthquake , Japan had a demand @-@ supply gap of approximately 5 % of GDP .
while reducing this gap to 3 % of GDP has led to higher prices , this is exactly what Japan needs after years of persistent deflation .
meanwhile , higher public spending on capital investment and other special procurements will boost domestic demand .
the Hanshin earthquake in 1995 destroyed capital stock worth 2 % of GDP .
this time , the loss is estimated at 3.4 % of GDP , implying a larger increase in domestic demand if the right public policies are pursued .
on the downside , confidence among consumers and investors alike has taken a hit , mainly owing to fears about radiation leakages and power shortages .
according to the Japan Center for Economic Research , power @-@ supply disruptions could negatively affect the Japanese economy for the next three years .
if the Tokyo metropolitan area &apos;s power supply were to decrease by 10 % this year , for example , Japan &apos;s GDP would fall by 2 % .
soon after the disaster , the government announced that reconstruction demand and higher prices would bring about relatively rapid economic recovery .
I think this view is too optimistic , because I suspect that the government wants to finance its new expenditure with a tax hike .
moreover , the extremely sharp contraction in first @-@ quarter GDP may indicate that the disaster &apos;s negative impact on the economy was more significant than expected .
indeed , the economy is expected to have shrunk by another 2.6 % year on year in the second quarter , with growth set to resume only in July @-@ September .
and , contrary to the government &apos;s outlook , the start of economic recovery could be delayed until the end of this year , with medium @-@ term annual growth reaching 1.5- 2 % .
a key question has been the disaster &apos;s impact on global supply chains .
according to Japan &apos;s Ministry of Economy , Trade , and Industry , which surveyed firms roughly a month after the earthquake , more than 60 % of production sites in affected areas had already recovered as of April 15 .
almost 30 % expected to recover by the summer , and the remaining 10 % foresaw normal operations after the autumn .
but the impact of even a small number of disruptions to supply chains can be highly significant , particularly for the Asia @-@ Pacific region .
consider Renesas Electronics , a medium @-@ size company , with ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.9 billion ) in annual sales , which accounts for more than half of worldwide production of essential micro @-@ computing components for automobiles .
partly as a result of the damage at Renesas , Toyota &apos;s capacity @-@ utilization rate dropped to 50 % at the beginning of May .
likewise , the chemical manufacturer Kureha ( ¥ 130 billion in annual sales ) has a 70 % share of the global market for adhesive materials for lithium @-@ ion batteries - a small but essential component of cell phones .
Nokia in Finland , for example , imports 12 % of its cell @-@ phone components from Japan , and thus could be indirectly affected by the disaster .
as a result , more companies are likely to create and implement business continuity plans .
indeed , &quot; BCP &quot; is set to become a key term in the region &apos;s economic discourse .
using BCPs to determine alternative producers means that regional economies will be integrated in a new form , with companies establishing cooperative relationships even with their competitors .
unfortunately , Japan &apos;s public officials appear incapable of similar flexibility .
the disaster confirmed the traditional view of Japan as a country that combines a dynamic private sector with an anemic public sector and central administration .
the government &apos;s mistakes in so @-@ called &quot; risk communication &quot; regarding the Fukushima nuclear plant , and its slowness in getting necessary aid to people displaced by the disaster , have once again put the stereotype on full display .
in terms of international relations , however , the disaster could improve Japan &apos;s bilateral ties with influential countries .
for example , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South Korean President Lee Myung @-@ bak met with outgoing Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan in Fukushima , near the damaged plant - helping to ease neighboring countries &quot; concerns about radiation leakage .
moreover , Japan &apos;s relations with the US , which had suffered since the Democratic Party of Japan came to power two years ago , appear to have emerged from the disaster stronger than ever .
Japan &apos;s Self @-@ Defense Forces played an important role in rescue and restoration activities , with about half of its 200,000 personnel dispatched to the damaged area .
while this severely weakened Japan &apos;s defenses , the US ensured East Asia &apos;s security by deploying an aircraft carrier and cruisers , and American forces also searched for missing victims together with the JSDF .
but Japan &apos;s neighbors expect rapid reconstruction and normalization , and for that , stronger political leadership is needed .
the earthquake and tsunami have confronted Japan with a profound crisis - but also with a rare opportunity to undertake the comprehensive reforms that the country has postponed for far too long .
will the US @-@ Japan Alliance Survive ?
Cambridge - Next year marks the 50th anniversary of the United States @-@ Japan Security Treaty , a central feature of stability in East Asia for half a century .
but now , with the Japanese experiencing a period of domestic political uncertainty , and North Korea &apos;s nuclear tests and missile launches increasing their anxiety , will Japan reverse its long @-@ standing decision not to seek a national nuclear @-@ deterrent capability ?
is the US @-@ Japan alliance coming to an end ?
in the early 1990 &quot; s , many Americans regarded Japan as an economic threat .
some people - in both countries - viewed the security alliance as a Cold War relic to be discarded .
these trends were reversed by the Clinton administration &apos;s 1995 &quot; East Asia Strategy Report . &quot;
in 1996 , the Clinton @-@ Hashimoto Declaration stated that the US @-@ Japan security alliance was the foundation for stability that would allow growing prosperity in post @-@ Cold War East Asia .
that approach has continued on a bipartisan basis in the US , and polls show that it retains broad acceptance in Japan .
most close observers of the relationship agree that the US @-@ Japan alliance is in much better shape today than 15 years ago .
nonetheless , the alliance faces three major challenges in a new external environment .
one is North Korea , whose recent behavior has been clever and deceptive .
the North Koreans have violated their agreements , knowing that China , the country with the greatest potential leverage , is most concerned about regime collapse in North Korea , and thus the threat of chaos on its borders .
Japan officially endorses the objective of a non @-@ nuclear world , but it relies on America &apos;s extended nuclear deterrent , and wants to avoid being subject to nuclear blackmail from North Korea ( or China ) .
the Japanese fear that the credibility of American extended deterrence will be weakened if the US decreases its nuclear forces to parity with China .
it is a mistake , however , to believe that extended deterrence depends on parity in numbers of nuclear weapons .
rather , it depends on a combination of capability and credibility .
during the Cold War , the US was able to defend Berlin because our promise to do so was made credible by the NATO alliance and the presence of American troops , whose lives would be on the line in the event of a Soviet attack .
indeed , the best guarantee of American extended deterrence over Japan remains the presence of nearly 50,000 American troops ( which Japan helps to maintain with generous host @-@ nation support ) .
credibility is also enhanced by joint projects such as the development of regional ballistic missile defense .
equally important are American actions that show the high priority that the US gives to the alliance , and its guarantees not to engage in what Japan fears will be &quot; Japan @-@ passing &quot; in its relations with Asia .
that is why it was so important that US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &apos;s first trip was to Asia , and her first stop in Japan .
it is also why it is mistaken to speak of a formal G @-@ 2 with China , rather than multilateral cooperation .
a second challenge for Japan is the dramatic rise of China &apos;s economy .
although an important trade partner , China &apos;s growing power makes Japan nervous .
when re @-@ negotiating the US @-@ Japan security alliance in the 1990 &quot; s , Japanese leaders sometimes privately asked me if the US would desert Japan in favor of China .
I responded then ( and today ) that there is little prospect of such a reversal , for two reasons .
first , China poses a potential threat , whereas Japan does not .
second , the US shares democratic values with Japan , and China is not a democracy .
moreover , China &apos;s internal evolution remains uncertain .
while Chinese are more free today than at any time in their history , China &apos;s political evolution has lagged behind its economic progress .
unlike India , China has not solved the problem of political participation .
there is always a residual danger that China will embrace nationalism to ward off domestic problems .
at the same time , it is in the interest of the US , Japan , and China that China &apos;s rise be peaceful and harmonious ( in the words of Chinese leaders ) .
treat China as an enemy , and you guarantee enmity .
that is why the strategy of integration , plus a hedge against uncertainty , makes sense for both the US and Japan .
indeed , there are strong grounds for the US , Japan , and China to engage in areas of trilateral and other regional cooperation .
third , the US @-@ Japan alliance will have to face a new set of transnational challenges to our vital interests , such as pandemics , terrorism , and human outflows from failed states .
chief among these challenges is the threat posed by global warming , with China having surpassed the US as the leading producer of carbon @-@ dioxide emissions ( though not in per capita terms ) .
fortunately , this is an area that plays to Japan &apos;s strengths .
although some Japanese complain about the unequal nature of the alliance &apos;s security components , owing to the limits that Japan has accepted on the use of force , in these new areas , Japan is a stronger partner .
Japan &apos;s overseas development assistance in places ranging from Africa to Afghanistan , its participation in global health projects , its support of the United Nations , its naval participation in anti @-@ piracy operations , and its research and development on energy efficiency place it at the forefront in dealing with the new transnational challenges .
given today &apos;s agenda , there is enormous potential for an equal partnership , working with others , in the provision of global public goods that will benefit the US , Japan , and the rest of the world .
that is why I remain optimistic about the future of the US @-@ Japan alliance .
can Trump &apos;s Sanctions Break Iran ?
London - &quot; The Iran sanctions have officially been cast , &quot; tweeted US President Donald Trump three months after he signed an executive order in May announcing his administration &apos;s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal .
he went on to boast the return of &quot; the most biting sanctions ever imposed , &quot; as if sounding the death knell of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ( JCPOA ) , as the deal is officially known .
the announcement took few observers by surprise .
but the irony was not lost on Wendy Sherman , the JCPOA &apos;s senior US negotiator , who quipped recently that she had always expected &quot; the greatest challenge to the deal &apos;s success would be violations by Iran , not the political machinations of the president of the United States . &quot;
indeed , Iran and the US seem to have reversed roles : Iran &apos;s isolation before the deal now contrasts with America &apos;s determination to swim against the global tide .
disappointment , if not disbelief , prevailed among the JCPOA &apos;s other parties - the European Union countries , Russia , and China - whose leaders were quick to reaffirm their strong commitment to the agreement .
by contrast , US officials have reiterated the Trump administration &apos;s determination permanently to rein in Iran &apos;s &quot; nuclear ambitions , &quot; limit its ballistic missiles program , and scale down its regional influence .
by the sanctions &quot; final stage , which kicks in on November 4 ( coinciding , as it happens , with the 39th anniversary of the abduction of diplomats and staff at the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979 ) , the US goal is to reduce Iran &apos;s oil exports &quot; down to zero . &quot;
given the long and fraught history of economic sanctions against Iran , the question looming now is whether this time they are more likely to be effective in changing the regime or its behavior .
the last time Iran &apos;s oil exports were reduced to negligible levels through an extensive economic boycott was in the mid @-@ twentieth century , when Iran &apos;s popularly elected prime minister , Mohammad Mossadegh , nationalized the oil industry .
a British @-@ led blockade of Iran &apos;s oil brought the industry to a virtual standstill , destabilized the economy , and paved the way for the infamous US and UK @-@ instigated coup which restored the Shah to power in 1953 .
such has been the hangover from those tumultuous years that it took a half @-@ century for US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to acknowledge in 2000 that the coup that ousted Mossadegh was a clear &quot; setback for Iran &apos;s political development &quot; and a key reason &quot; why many Iranians continue to resent this intervention by America . &quot;
such remorse , if it can be considered that , did not , however , close the door on more sanctions against Iran .
sanctions imposed by the US and the EU from 2010 to 2015 had mixed results .
these comprehensive measures - described by then @-@ US Vice President Joe Biden as &quot; the most crippling sanctions in the history of sanctions , &quot; shrank oil exports by two @-@ thirds , to below one million barrels a day .
the resulting stagflation heaped misery on ordinary Iranians , with GDP contracting almost 6 % in 2012 and inflation averaging 35 % the following year .
widespread private @-@ sector failures and growing unemployment followed .
contrary to the sanctions &quot; principal objectives , however , the economic and political hold of the public sector and parastatal organizations strengthened .
meanwhile , Iran insisted on its sovereign right to pursue a peaceful nuclear program .
the scope for compromise seemed absent until the reformist administration of President Hassan Rouhani took over in 2013 .
so what is different this time ?
though promising to be even more biting , the US sanctions regime is not backed by UN Security Council resolutions and hence lacks international legitimacy .
this means Iran &apos;s isolation will be far less complete , with key trading partners such as China and Turkey already announcing that they will abide by &quot; legal &quot; sanctions only .
but the sanctions &quot; de facto , not de jure , status will determine their effectiveness .
this is especially true of European firms , which will ultimately decide the outcome of the battle for secondary sanctions in cognizance of their shareholders &quot; interests , rather than the political machinations of their governments .
this explains the significant stream of exits from Iran &apos;s markets already announced by large firms .
in an interconnected world where US economic influence extends far and wide , it is hard even for European firms - auto manufacturers , airlines , energy companies , banks , and the like - to risk the ire of the US Treasury .
this means that the ultimate success of sanctions is likely to depend on what others make of them as much as on what Iran does .
but domestic conditions in Iran also play a key role , and it is here that the US seems to be basing its confidence that sanctions will &quot; succeed . &quot;
for months , Iranian cities have been rocked by widespread protests , ostensibly against worsening economic conditions .
these outbursts have weakened Iran &apos;s reformers by undermining their monopoly on hope .
hardliners , it seems , have been offered a new lease on life and can now claim their dismissal of the JCPOA was justified from the start .
the economic impact has already been felt , with the Iranian currency going into freefall after speculation about a US withdrawal from the deal began .
the specter of inflation is back .
ultimately , for sanctions to succeed from the US perspective , they must bring about either regime change or behavioral change .
historically , sanctions have a less @-@ than @-@ convincing track record ( think Cuba , Myanmar , and Zimbabwe ) on achieving the former , and whether they can pave the way for the latter , in the form of a negotiated settlement , remains to be seen .
but one thing is clear : applied to Iran , the &quot; Trump doctrine &quot; of pushing one &apos;s foes to the brink , in the hope that they will blink first , has entered uncharted terrain .
renminbi Rising ?
Shanghai - China is increasingly debating whether or not the renminbi should be internationalized , possibly joining the US dollar and the euro as an international vehicle currency ( IVC ) - that is , a currency that other countries use to denominate the prices of their traded goods and international loans .
related to this is a debate about whether Shanghai can become a first @-@ tier international financial center ( 1 @-@ IFC ) like London and New York .
financial history can help to answer these questions .
first , a city can become a 1 @-@ IFC only if its national currency is an IVC .
but , as London &apos;s status shows , a longtime 1 @-@ IFC can retain its position in the international financial system even if its currency is no longer an IVC .
second , the transaction cost of using a foreign currency as a medium of exchange is inversely proportional to the extent to which that currency is used globally .
similar economies of scale characterize foreign investors &quot; use of a particular international financial center .
as a result , there cannot be more than three or four IVCs and 1 @-@ IFCs .
third , a country &apos;s financial sector must be both open , with no capital @-@ flow restrictions , and sophisticated , with a wide range of instruments and institutions .
it must also be safe , with a central bank maintaining economic stability , prudential regulators keeping fraud and speculation in check , macro @-@ prudential authorities displaying adequate financial fire @-@ fighting capabilities , and a legal system that is predictable , transparent , and fair .
last - and most important - successful convergence to IVC and 1 @-@ IFC status requires the national economy to be strong relative to other economies for a substantial period of time .
the United Kingdom occupied a position of global economic leadership for more than a century .
in 1914 , the US / UK GDP ratio was 2.1 , but the US dollar was not an IVC , suggesting that America &apos;s relative economic strength was inadequate .
a decade later , in 1924 , the ratio was 3.2 and rising - and the US dollar had eclipsed the British pound as the most important IVC .
relative economic strength explains why the Japanese yen failed to develop into an IVC , and why Tokyo - whose financial markets satisfied the relevant requirements - failed to become a 1 @-@ IFC .
with its GDP reaching only about 60 % of America &apos;s at its peak in 1991 , Japan never attained the critical mass required to induce foreigners to use the yen to lower transaction costs .
determining the future international status of the renminbi and Shanghai must begin with a calculation of China &apos;s expected relative economic strength vis @-@ à @-@ vis the US under two plausible scenarios .
in the first scenario , China becomes caught in a middle @-@ income trap , with per capita GDP stuck at 30 % of America &apos;s - an outcome that has characterized Latin America &apos;s five largest economies since at least 1960 , and Malaysia since 1994 .
this would put China &apos;s economic strength relative to the US at 1.1 - well below the necessary ratio .
in the second , more favorable scenario , China &apos;s per capita GDP would reach 80 % of America &apos;s - higher than the 70 % average rate for the five largest Western European countries since 1960 - and its economic strength relative to the US would amount to roughly 2.8 .
this would make the renminbi eligible for IVC status and enable Shanghai to choose whether to become a 1 @-@ IFC .
but China &apos;s economy still would not be strong enough relative to the US for natural market forces to ensure the renminbi &apos;s international success .
given this , the Chinese government would have to implement decisive measures to encourage international traders and creditors to price their transactions in renminbi .
specifically , China would have to use its market power to promote pricing in renminbi for relevant manufactured exports and raw @-@ material imports , and encourage renminbi denomination of foreign financial assets that China purchases ( which the country &apos;s status as a net creditor should facilitate ) .
but there are serious pitfalls to avoid in this process .
as the Asian financial crisis of 1997 @-@ 1998 demonstrated , capital @-@ account liberalization could lead to financial meltdowns - a danger that opponents of internationalizing the renminbi often cite .
but these risks do not outweigh the potential benefits of financial openness , and they can be minimized with effective monitoring and regulation , including requirements for large capital buffers and low leverage ratios , together with strong crisis @-@ response mechanisms , like a resolution trust corporation .
in fact , effective financial @-@ monitoring and prudential @-@ regulation systems do not have to precede opening the capital account .
on the contrary , developing and enacting financial regulation must be a gradual process , shaped by both existing knowledge and firsthand experience .
after all , no financial market is either completely open or completely closed forever ; the degree of openness at a given moment depends on policy choices .
the recent establishment of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone will allow for the emergence of an offshore international financial center that offers real @-@ world training to China &apos;s regulators .
this will give them the tools they need to recognize the signs of a developing crisis , defuse the threat , and efficiently handle the recapitalization and reorganization of failed financial institutions .
China &apos;s pursuit of an IVC and a 1 @-@ IFC city would serve not only its own interests .
allowing the renminbi to help meet global demand for international reserves and risk diversification would also strengthen global financial stability .
there is little time to waste in internationalizing the renminbi .
given the limited number of currencies that can serve as IVCs , the failure of the renminbi to achieve IVC status before , say , the Indian rupee , the Russian ruble , or the Brazilian real could mean that the renminbi is denied IVC status - and that Shanghai fails to achieve 1 @-@ IFC status - for generations , if not forever .
winners and Losers in the Post @-@ 9 / 11 Era
September 11 , 2001 , is one of those dates that mark a transformation in world politics .
just as the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9 , 1989 , signified the Cold War &apos;s end , al @-@ Qaeda &apos;s attack on the United States opened a new epoch .
a non @-@ governmental group killed more Americans that day than the government of Japan did with its surprise attack on another transformative date , December 7 , 1941 .
while the jihadi terrorist movement had been growing for a decade , 9 / 11 was the turning point .
five years into this new era , how should we characterize it ?
some believe that 9 / 11 ushered in a &quot; clash of civilizations &quot; between Islam vs. the West .
indeed , that is probably what Osama bin Laden had in mind .
terrorism is a form of theater .
extremists kill innocent people in order to dramatize their message in a way that shocks and horrifies their intended audience .
they also rely on what Clark McCauley and others have called &quot; jujitsu politics , &quot; in which a smaller fighter uses the strength of the larger opponent to defeat him .
in that sense , bin Laden hoped that the US would be lured into a bloody war in Afghanistan , similar to the Soviet intervention two decades earlier , which had created such a fertile recruiting ground for jihadists .
but the Americans used a modest amount of force to remove the Taliban government , avoided disproportionate civilian casualties , and were able to create an indigenous political framework .
while far from perfect , the first round in the fight went to the US .
al @-@ Qaeda lost the sanctuaries from which it planned its attacks ; many of its leaders were killed or captured ; and its central communications were severely disrupted .
then the Bush administration succumbed to hubris and made the colossal mistake of invading Iraq without broad international support .
Iraq provided the symbols , civilian casualties , and recruiting ground that the jihadi extremists had sought in Afghanistan .
Iraq was George Bush &apos;s gift to Osama bin Laden .
al @-@ Qaeda lost its central organizational capacity , but it became a symbol and focal point around which like @-@ minded imitators could rally .
with the help of the Internet , its symbols and training materials became easily available around the world .
whether al @-@ Qaeda had a direct role in the Madrid and London bombings , or the recent plot to blow up airliners over the Atlantic , is less important than the way it has been transformed into a powerful &quot; brand . &quot;
the second round went to the extremists .
the outcome of future rounds in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will depend on our ability to avoid the trap of &quot; jujitsu politics . &quot;
that will require more use of the soft power of attraction rather than relying so heavily on hard military power , as the Bush administration has done .
for the struggle is not a clash of Islam vs. the West , but a civil war within Islam between a minority of terrorists and a larger mainstream of non @-@ violent believers .
jihadi extremism cannot be defeated unless the mainstream wins .
military force , intelligence , and international police cooperation needs to be used against hardcore terrorists affiliated with or inspired by al @-@ Qaeda , but soft power is essential to attracting the mainstream and drying up support for the extremists .
US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once said that the measure of success in this war is whether the number of terrorists we are killing and deterring is larger than the number that the terrorists are recruiting .
by this standard , we are doing badly .
in November 2003 , the official number of terrorist insurgents in Iraq was given as 5,000 .
this year , it was reported to be 20,000 .
as Brig. General Robert Caslen , the Pentagon &apos;s deputy director for the war on terrorism , put it , &quot; We are not killing them faster than they are being created . &quot;
we are also failing in the application of soft power .
according to Caslen , &quot; We in the Pentagon are behind our adversaries in the use of communication - either to recruit or train . &quot;
the manner in which we use military power also affects Rumsfeld &apos;s ratio .
in the aftermath of 9 / 11 , there was a good deal of sympathy and understanding around the world for America &apos;s military response against the Taliban .
the US invasion of Iraq , a country that was not connected to the 9 / 11 attacks , squandered that good will , and the attractiveness of the US in Muslim countries like Indonesia plummeted from 75 % approval in 2000 to half that level today .
indeed , occupying a divided nation is messy , and it is bound to produce episodes like Abu Ghraib and Haditha , which undercut America &apos;s attractiveness not just in Iraq , but around the world .
the ability to combine hard and soft power is smart power .
when the Soviet Union invaded Hungary and Czechoslovakia during the Cold War , it undercut the soft power that it had enjoyed in Europe in the aftermath of World War II .
when Israel launched a lengthy bombing campaign in Lebanon last month , it created so many civilian casualties that the early criticisms of Hezbollah by Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia became untenable in Arab politics .
when terrorist excesses killed innocent Muslim civilians such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad did in 1993 or Abu Musab al @-@ Zarqawi did in Amman in 2005 , they undercut their own soft power and lost support .
the most important lesson five years after 9 / 11 is that failure to combine hard and soft power effectively in the struggle against jihadi terrorism will lead us into the trap set by those who want a clash of civilizations .
Muslims , including Islamists , have a diversity of views , so we need to be wary of strategies that help our enemies by uniting disparate forces behind one banner .
we have a just cause and many potential allies , but our failure to combine hard and soft power into a smart strategy could be fatal .
the Middle East &apos;s Lost Decade
Berlin - The United States has waged three wars since Al Qaeda &apos;s terrorist attacks on September 11 , 2001 : against Al Qaeda , in Afghanistan , and in Iraq .
the first two were forced upon the US , but the third was the result of a willful , deliberate decision by former President George W. Bush , taken on ideological grounds and , most likely , for personal reasons as well .
had Bush , former Vice President Dick Cheney , former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , and their neocon allies been forthright about their intentions - to bring down Saddam Hussein by means of war , thereby creating a new , pro @-@ Western Middle East - they never would have received the support of Congress and the American public .
their vision was both naive and reckless .
so a threat - Iraqi weapons of mass destruction - had to be created .
as we now know , the threat was based on lies ( aluminum tubes for a nuclear @-@ weapons program , for example , meetings between the 9 / 11 plot leader , Mohamed Atta , and Iraqi officials in Prague , and even glaring forgeries like supposed Iraqi orders for yellowcake uranium from Niger ) .
such were the justifications for a war that was to claim the lives of almost 5,000 US soldiers and more than 100,000 Iraqis .
add to that the millions more who were injured and displaced from their homes , as well as the destruction of one of the world &apos;s oldest Christian communities .
for this , the US alone spent up to $ 3 trillion .
Bush &apos;s war against Saddam did radically change the Middle East , though not as he envisaged .
for starters , if the US had set out to destabilize Iraq , its efforts could hardly have been more successful : ten years later , the country &apos;s viability as a single state has never been in greater doubt .
with Saddam gone , Iraq &apos;s Shia majority assumed power after a horrendous civil war , leaving Iraq &apos;s defeated Sunnis longing for revenge and waiting for an opportunity to regain their ascendancy .
the Kurds in the north cleverly and adeptly used the window of opportunity that opened before them to seize de facto independence , though the key question of control over the northern city of Kirkuk remains a ticking time bomb .
and all are fighting for as large a share of Iraq &apos;s enormous oil and gas reserves as they can get .
taking stock of &quot; Operation Iraqi Freedom &quot; a decade later , the Financial Times concluded that the US won the war , Iran won the peace , and Turkey won the contracts .
I can only agree .
in political terms , Iran is the big winner of Bush &apos;s war .
its number @-@ one enemy , Saddam , was dispatched by its number @-@ two enemy , the United States , which presented Iran with a golden opportunity to extend its influence beyond its western border for the first time since 1746 .
Bush &apos;s war , with its poor strategic vision and worse planning , increased Iran &apos;s regional standing in a way that the country was unlikely ever to have achieved on its own .
the war enabled Iran to assert itself as the dominant power in the Gulf and the wider region , and its nuclear program serves precisely these ambitions .
the losers in the region are also clear : Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf states , which feel existentially threatened , and have come to regard their own Shia minorities as an Iranian fifth column .
they have a point : with the Shia in power in Iraq , Iran will seek suitable opportunities to use local Shia populations as proxies to assert its hegemonic claims .
this is what is fueling Bahrain &apos;s domestic turmoil , beyond the Shia majority &apos;s local grievances .
leaving aside the lies , fictions , and questions of morality and personal responsibility , the critical mistake of America &apos;s war against Iraq was the absence of either a viable plan or the necessary strength to enforce a Pax Americana in the Middle East .
America was powerful enough to destabilize the existing regional order , but not powerful enough to establish a new one .
the US neocons , with their wishful thinking , grossly underestimated the scale of the task at hand - unlike the revolutionaries in Iran , who quickly moved in to reap what the US had sowed .
the Iraq war also marked the beginning of America &apos;s subsequent relative decline .
Bush squandered a large part of America &apos;s military strength in Mesopotamia for an ideological fiction - strength that is sorely missed in the region ten years later .
and there is no alternative to be seen without America .
while there is no causal link between the Iraq war and the Arab revolutions that began in December 2010 , their implications have combined in a malign manner .
since the war , the bitter enmities between Al Qaeda and other Salafist and Sunni Arab nationalist groups have given way to cooperation or even mergers .
this , too , is a result brought about by the American neocon masterminds .
and the regional destabilization triggered by the Arab revolutions is increasingly converging on Iraq , mainly via Syria and Iran .
indeed , the gravest current danger to the region is a process of national disintegration emanating from the Syrian civil war , which is threatening to spread not only to Iraq , but also to Lebanon and Jordan .
what makes Syria &apos;s civil war so dangerous is that the players on the ground are no longer its driving forces .
rather , the war has become a struggle for regional dominance between Iran on one side and Saudi Arabia , Qatar , and Turkey on the other .
as a result , the Middle East is at risk of becoming the Balkans of the twenty @-@ first century - a decline into regional chaos that began with , and was largely the result of , the US @-@ led invasion ten years ago .
winning the Confidence Game
new HAVEN - On April 2 , the G @-@ 20 will hold a summit in London to discuss what we may hope will be an internationally coordinated plan to address the world economic crisis .
but can such a plan really work ?
the basic problem , of course , is confidence .
people everywhere , consumers and investors alike , are canceling spending plans , because the world economy seems very risky right now . the same thing happened during the Great Depression of the 1930 &quot; s .
a contemporary observer , Winthrop Case , explained it all in 1938 : economic revival depended &quot; on the willingness of individual and corporate buyers to make purchases that necessarily tie up their resources for a considerable length of time .
for the individual , this implies confidence in the job , and in the end comes equally back to the confidence of industry leaders . &quot;
unfortunately , confidence did not return until World War II ended the depression .
if the leaders meeting in London are to succeed where governments failed in the 1930 &quot; s , they must commit themselves to a fiscal target that is sufficient to restore full employment under normal credit conditions .
they must also commit themselves to a credit target that will restore lending to normal .
people will not spend normally unless they have both a job and normal access to credit .
during the Great Depression , such targets were not used on a large enough scale , merely fueling public despair that stimulus policies would ever work .
the G @-@ 20 Summit should also be an occasion for affirming some basic principles .
confidence isn &apos;t built up on the basis of spending or lending alone .
people need to believe that the money represents something more lasting than stimulus measures , which may eventually end in failure .
after all , the Great Depression did not end simply because of the massive stimulus of war @-@ related expenditures .
why should World War II have produced any confidence in the future ?
to be sure , World War II reduced the unemployment rate in the United States dramatically , from 15 % in 1940 to 1 % in 1944 , and had a similar effect in other countries .
but this was not because of a revival in business confidence .
it was because of a nasty war , plain and simple , with people drafted into fighting , or into industries supplying the war effort .
the real recovery of confidence did not occur until after World War II , when the world did not sink back into depression .
the US Council of Economic Advisors warned of this possibility in 1949 , and it was not alone .
there appears to be more than one reason why , on the contrary , confidence came roaring back .
first , there was a general perception of &quot; pent @-@ up demand . &quot;
after years of privation ( and in many countries the physical destruction of war ) , people just wanted to live normally - to rebuild , own a home , a car , and other consumer goods .
the widespread impression that there was such pent @-@ up demand also led people to believe that there could not be another depression .
the perception of pent @-@ up demand was like a powerful economic stimulus package , and it had the advantage that people believed it would be long @-@ lasting .
indeed , the same long @-@ term confidence triggered the post @-@ war &quot; baby boom . &quot;
according to some contemporary observers , however , &quot; pent @-@ up demand &quot; was only part of the story .
during the brief but deep recession of 1949 , the financial commentator Silvia Porter reflected on the attitudes that led to the 1929 crash : &quot; we saw nothing wrong - in fact , we saw everything right - with the wild speculative boom and credit inflation that ... culminated in the now almost unbelievable gambling orgy of 1929 . &quot;
but now , Porter wrote , after the depression and war , &quot; We began to listen to the idea that a hundred million citizens , acting through a central government , could achieve much more than a hundred million acting as separate selfish units .
we developed , in short , a new attitude toward the responsibilities of government . &quot;
she concluded that the positive effect of &quot; pent @-@ up demand &quot; and government measures can &quot; make sense only when viewed against the background of our changed economic and political philosophy . &quot;
the Marshall Plan , which operated from 1947 to 1951 , became a symbol of this new attitude .
the US gave billions of dollars of aid to rebuild war @-@ ravaged countries in Europe .
the plan was widely viewed as reflecting a new kind of enlightenment , a recognition of the importance of supporting people who needed help .
Europe would not be allowed to languish , and the stimulus came from abroad .
after the war , Keynesian economic theory , which was generally not accepted or understood during the Great Depression , became the basis of a new social compact . it was a theory that was perfectly suited to a generation that had just endured exceptional sacrifices , for it reaffirmed a belief in our responsibility for each other .
the effect of economic stimulus is redoubled by this kind of inspirational belief .
that is why all of the commitments made and intentions expressed at the upcoming G @-@ 20 summit matter .
the countries represented must show a generous spirit and make the world economy work for all people .
seemingly peripheral issues , like aid to the developing world and the poor , who suffer the most from a crisis like this one , will be part of the primary story of the renewal of confidence , just as the Marshall Plan was part of that story after World War II .
winning the European Confidence Game
Chicago - If any solution to the European crisis proposed over the next few days is to restore confidence to the sovereign @-@ bond markets , it will have to be both economically viable and politically palatable to rescuers and rescued alike .
this means paying attention not just to the plan &apos;s technical details , but also to appearances .
there is growing consensus about any solution &apos;s key elements .
first , Italy and Spain will have to come up with credible medium @-@ term plans that will not just restore their fiscal health , but also improve their ability to grow their way out of trouble .
while any plan will involve pain for citizens , the markets must deem the pain politically tolerable , at least relative to the alternatives .
it is important that these plans be seen as domestically devised ( though voters will have no illusions about the external and market pressures that have forced their governments to act ) .
at the same time , an external agency such as the International Monetary Fund could render the plan more credible by evaluating it for consistency with the country &apos;s goals and monitoring its implementation .
second , some vehicle - the IMF or the European Financial Stability Facility , with either entity funded directly by countries or the European Central Bank - has to stand ready to fund borrowing by Italy , Spain , and any other potentially distressed countries over the next year or two .
but there is an important caveat , which has largely been ignored in public discussions : if this funding is senior to private debt ( as IMF funding typically is ) , it will be harder for these countries to regain access to markets .
after all , the more a country borrows in the short term from official sources , the further back in line it pushes private creditors .
that makes private lenders susceptible to larger haircuts if the country eventually defaults - and thus more hesitant to lend in the first place .
in other words , private markets need to be convinced both that there is a low probability of default ( hence the importance of credible plans ) , and that there is some additional loss @-@ bearing capacity in the new funding , so that , if there is a default , outstanding or rolled @-@ over private debt does not have to bear the full brunt .
this may seem unfair .
why should the taxpayer accept a loss when they are bailing out the private sector by providing new funding ?
in an ideal world , distressed countries would default as soon as private markets stopped funding them , and they would impose the losses on private bondholders .
in the real world , however , if Italy and Spain are viewed as being solvent , or too big to fail , official funding should be structured so that it gives these countries their best chance to regain market confidence .
this does not mean that official funding should be junior to private debt in any restructuring , for that would require substantially more loss @-@ bearing capacity from the official sector - capacity that is probably not available .
indeed , if official funding were junior , it would be providing a larger cushion to private creditors - and thus bailing them out to an even greater extent .
the simplest solution is to treat official funding no differently from private debt - best achieved if official lenders buy sovereign bonds as they are issued ( possibly at a predetermined yield ) and agree to be treated on par with private creditors in a restructuring .
as the country regains market confidence , the official funding can be reduced , and eventually the bonds can be sold back to the markets .
the bottom line is that official funding must be accompanied by loss @-@ bearing capacity .
if the funding is channeled through the IMF , and is to be treated on par with private debt , the Fund will need a guarantee from the EFSF or strong eurozone countries that it will be indemnified in any restructuring .
of course , the IMF &apos;s member states might be willing to accept some burden sharing if a sufficient buffer provided by the eurozone were eroded , but that cannot be taken for granted .
once the first two elements of the plan are in place , there should be little need for the third - bond purchases by the ECB in the secondary market in order to narrow interest @-@ rate spreads and provide further confidence .
indeed , if the ECB intends to claim preferred @-@ creditor status for any bonds that it buys , it is probably best that it buy very few .
of course , the ECB will have to continue to provide support to banks until confidence about their holdings returns .
but there is one more element that is needed to assure markets that the solution is politically viable .
citizens across Europe , whether in rescued countries or rescuing countries , will be paying for years to clean up a mess for which they were not responsible .
not all banks voluntarily loaded up on distressed government bonds - some were pressured by supervisors , others by governments - but many have made unwise bets .
if they are seen as profiting unduly from the rescue , even as they return to their bad old ways of paying for non @-@ performance , they will undermine political support for the rescue - and perhaps even for capitalism .
so a final element of the package ought to be a monitored pledge by eurozone banks that they will not unload bonds as the official sector steps in ; that they will raise capital over time instead of continuing to deleverage ( if this hurts bank equity holders , they should think of this as burden sharing ) ; and that they will be circumspect about banker bonuses until economies start growing strongly again .
cries that this is not capitalism should be met with a firm retort : &quot; nor are bailouts ! &quot;
winning the Peace
Afghanistan &apos;s future hangs in the balance as its weak national government struggles to maintain support and legitimacy in the face of a widening insurgency , warlords , the heroin trade , and a disappointed populace .
across an arc extending from Afghanistan to East Africa , violence now also surges in Iraq , Lebanon , Somalia , and beyond , to Sudan &apos;s Darfur region .
everywhere , politicians , generals , and even diplomats talk of military strategies and maneuvers , but everywhere something utterly different is needed .
stability will come only when economic opportunities exist , when a bulging generation of young men can find jobs and support families , rather than seeking their fortune in violence .
we are seeing again and again that a foreign army , whether NATO &apos;s in Afghanistan , America &apos;s in Iraq , Israel &apos;s in occupied Palestine , or Ethiopia &apos;s in Somalia , may win a battle , or even a war , but never the peace .
peace is about dignity and hope for the future .
military occupation saps dignity , and grinding poverty and economic disarray sap hope .
peace can be achieved only with a withdrawal of foreign troops , and the arrival of jobs , productive farms and factories , tourism , health care , and schools .
without these , military victory and occupation quickly turn to ashes .
the United States government has proven itself blind to these facts , but the international community also remains ill equipped to assist in the restoration of peace following conflicts in impoverished countries .
repeatedly , a fragile peace has broken down because of the lack of economic follow @-@ up .
despite grand promises of foreign aid , economic reconstruction , and development in Afghanistan , Iraq , Lebanon , and elsewhere , the actual record of international assistance to post @-@ war reconstruction is gravely deficient .
the scenario has become painfully familiar . a war ends .
an international donors &quot; conference is called . pledges of billions of dollars are announced .
a smiling new head of state graciously thanks the international community , including the occupying power .
months pass . world Bank teams from Washington start to arrive .
but actual reconstruction and recovery is delayed , perhaps for years .
crony businesses from the US and Europe , which are utterly unfamiliar with local conditions , squander time , aid funds , and opportunities .
two or three years pass .
the grand pronouncements become a pile of out @-@ of @-@ date World Bank studies .
recriminations fly , the occupying army remains , and a new insurgency spreads .
many factors contribute to this disarray , beginning with the shocking inability of the US , Europe , and the international organizations to understand things from the perspective of poor and displaced people .
their lack of empathy is deplorable , but there are conceptual problems as well .
the international agencies involved in post @-@ conflict reconstruction have so far failed to understand how to start or restart economic development in a low @-@ income setting .
it &apos;s important to distinguish four distinct phases of outside help to end a conflict .
in the first phase , during the war itself , aid is for humanitarian relief , focusing on food , water , emergency medicine , and refugee camps .
in the second phase , at the war &apos;s end , aid remains mainly humanitarian relief , but now directed towards displaced people returning home , and to decommissioned soldiers .
in the third phase , lasting three to five years , aid supports the first phase of post @-@ war economic development , including restoration of schools , clinics , farms , factories , and ports .
in the fourth phase , which can last a generation or more , assistance is directed to long @-@ term investments and the strengthening of institutions such as courts .
the international community , and the US in particular , is dreadful at the third stage .
once a conflict is over , aid agencies seem paralyzed .
instead of sending help , they send study groups .
there is often a lag of years before moving from humanitarian relief to real economic development .
by the time such help actually arrives , it is often too late : war has been re @-@ ignited .
in fact , it is possible to restart economic development through targeted &quot; quick @-@ impact &quot; initiatives .
since the economies of most impoverished post @-@ conflict countries are based on agriculture , restarting farm output is vital .
impoverished farmers should receive a free package of seeds , fertilizers , and low @-@ cost equipment ( such as pumps for irrigation ) .
when such aid is made available quickly , former soldiers will return to their farms , and can establish a livelihood by the beginning of the first growing season following the end of hostilities .
this type of aid does not require long studies , but quick action .
similar quick @-@ impact measures should be undertaken to control disease .
small rural clinics can be built or rebuilt very quickly , within the first year of peace .
solar panels and wind turbines can provide off @-@ grid power in isolated rural areas .
wells and cisterns can be put in place to ensure safe drinking water .
these and similar efforts can mean the difference between famine and food security , epidemic disease and health , income and utter poverty , and , most importantly , hope and despair .
yet the window of opportunity closes quickly .
quick @-@ impact economic development is exactly what is needed now to help end the horrific violence and suffering in Darfur .
sanctions , threats , and peacekeepers are only short @-@ term measures , whereas real progress there against extreme poverty is not only achievable , but also is something that the government and rebels can agree on .
the same applies in Somalia .
but the window of opportunity closes quickly in these and other post @-@ conflict regions .
only by taking quick , meaningful action to fight hunger , poverty , and disease can there be a chance of creating conditions for long @-@ term peace .
winning the Transition
Washington , DC - Is the Arab Spring turning into a gloomy autumn ?
with brutal crackdowns in Syria , a bloody civil war in Libya , and Yemen teetering on the brink of chaos , the number of skeptics is growing .
although Egypt and Tunisia &apos;s pro @-@ democracy movements achieved rapid regime change , uncertainties remain in those countries , too .
after a brief period of hope , many observers now wonder whether the region is capable of producing viable , and economically vibrant , democracies .
revolutions and their aftermaths , of course , are always fluid and fickle times , and the outcome is often perched on a knife &apos;s edge .
bridging the vast gap between high expectations and the reality of limited budgets and capabilities is a test in itself .
redressing past injustice and building an economy that offers opportunity to all are major challenges as well , fraught with volatility , uncertainty , and the dangers of political opportunism .
but transitions are also times of great opportunity .
in the 1990 &quot; s , I was among those Indonesians who demanded and celebrated the departure of our own autocrat , Suharto , and I joined the new government when he left .
many observers predicted that Indonesia , the world &apos;s most populous Muslim country , would be unable to sustain democracy and would ultimately decline into chaos .
the task ahead of us was daunting .
but we proved the skeptics wrong , and learned some fundamental lessons .
perhaps most importantly , we learned that there is no one @-@ size @-@ fits @-@ all solution for democratization .
each of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa will face unique challenges , which will have to be addressed on their own terms .
even so , they all must make a real and symbolic break with the past .
the new authorities must send strong signals that the old ways are finished .
change must be formally manifested , with new laws that are widely publicized .
legislation that empowers citizens with freedom of expression , free and independent elections , and freedom of association is crucial , and it must be made clear to the public that no one is above the law . anything less will undermine the transition .
moreover , corruption is the bane of development everywhere , so new governments should move fast to establish institutions and procedures to fight it .
transparency and accountability are powerful ideas with near @-@ universal support , which means that new leaders should not give up when the fight becomes difficult .
civil @-@ society organizations , local communities , representatives of the poor and vulnerable , and women play a vital role in this regard , and they should be included at every level of decision @-@ making .
in Indonesia , we signed a hundred laws in less than 18 months , covering everything from media freedom to elections , corruption , decentralization , and anti @-@ trust rules .
we ratified new public @-@ finance legislation and ensured the independence of the country &apos;s central bank .
new leaders must also expect and manage setbacks .
in post @-@ revolutionary times , expectations are high , and the obstacles to meeting them are enormous .
I know from personal experience that we did not always have the luxury of getting the best outcomes .
we had to compromise and settle for the best possible results .
security threats are among the most serious setbacks in transitions .
nationalistic sentiment is strong , and politicians and interest groups can exploit it .
often , the security forces are holdovers from the old regime , and there is no independent judicial system .
reforms will take time , and the old bureaucracies may not be able to implement them .
in Indonesia , we used various innovations to work around such dilemmas .
for example , we appointed an independent judge to take over the bankruptcy and corruption courts , because career judges were too tainted .
likewise , when we started cash @-@ for @-@ work programs as part of our pro @-@ poor agenda , we asked communities to run these initiatives .
more broadly , new leaders are well advised to ensure that the economy performs well .
it is important to restore economic activity and create a favorable environment for entrepreneurs , particularly small and medium @-@ size businesses , which constitute the main engine of job creation .
the recent revolutions , it should be recalled , started with the self @-@ immolation of a Tunisian fruit vendor , who was harassed and insulted by the authorities .
but economic success without accountability and social inclusion is not sustainable , and new governments often must face tough choices in order to protect the poor and vulnerable .
they might have to abolish mis @-@ targeted subsidies to free up resources for more targeted and efficient anti @-@ poverty and job @-@ creation programs .
in Indonesia , we had to draw a line between the very poor and the near @-@ poor .
we could not afford to raise salaries or provide subsidies for everybody .
our help had to be targeted .
so , while we helped the neediest , we excluded others who were not poor enough to benefit .
this was a tough and unpopular choice .
finally , countries in transition need support - not only money , but also technical know @-@ how to implement highly complex reforms .
when I became Indonesia &apos;s finance minister , I had 64,000 employees .
but when we had to modernize our tax system , we could not find the required expertise anywhere in our country .
yes , we needed external assistance , but we never surrendered &quot; ownership &quot; of the reform process ; we made it work for us .
if we Indonesians had not been in charge of our own transition , it could easily have failed .
that lesson , too , is one that all countries in transition should bear in mind .
winning with Opium in Afghanistan
despite considerable effort by the international community in Afghanistan since 2001 to eliminate the Taliban and al Qaeda , the insurgency in the south of the country has gathered momentum at breakneck speed in recent months .
our field research shows that we are not winning the campaign for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people - the Taliban are .
indeed , the international community &apos;s methods of fighting the insurgency and eradicating poppy crops have actually helped the insurgents gain power .
the international community has so far pursued policies of destruction , rather than the promised reconstruction .
the aggressive United States @-@ led counter @-@ narcotics policy of crop eradication has failed to win the support of Afghans , because it has triggered a chain reaction of poverty and violence in which poor farmers , with their only livelihood destroyed , are unable to feed their families .
this has been exacerbated by the failure to provide even the most basic aid and development in the country &apos;s poorest areas .
at the same time , communities have been torn apart as a result of bombing campaigns , which have destroyed the very homes we came to protect .
this , in addition to four years of drought , has forced entire families to leave their villages for makeshift internal refugee camps .
you do not win people over by bombing them , but by helping them .
the Taliban have exploited the failures of the international community in extremely effective anti @-@ Western propaganda that has fueled significant doubt in the minds of the public concerning the reasons justifying the international presence in Afghanistan .
sadly , our troops are often the first to pay the price - sometimes with their lives .
it is not too late to win back the hearts and minds of the Afghan people .
international troops are excelling in an exceptionally hostile environment , but this is not a war that will be won by military means alone .
with public perception a crucial factor in winning the war , and the Taliban poised to launch a large military initiative next spring , failure to adopt a successful local strategy could signify the last chance the international community will have to build a secure and stable Afghanistan .
but a successful strategy - one that responds to Afghanistan &apos;s extreme poverty crisis -requires that the international community reverse course on crop eradication .
in fact , the eradication of poppy crops not only damage local communities and undermines the international community &apos;s goals , but it is also failing : opium production last year was at an all @-@ time high .
in September , the United Nations Office on Drugs Crime announced that poppy cultivation soared by a record @-@ high 60 % .
eradication will never be successful in Afghanistan , because it destroys the single crop that will grow in the south &apos;s harsh climate - and thus serves as the main source of income to millions of people .
so a new , long @-@ term , economically sustainable solution is urgently needed - one that directly engages with the communities that are suffering most - in order to achieve the support of the deeply impoverished rural population .
as a way to address this dilemma , the Senlis Council is proposing to run scientific pilot projects to research an opium licensing system for Afghanistan , which would be a core component of the economic reconstruction process .
a system in which poppy is cultivated under license for the production of pain @-@ killing medicines such as morphine and codeine would allow farmers to pursue their traditional livelihood and way of life , and , more importantly , to feed themselves and their families .
there is a global shortage of morphine and codeine , particularly in underdeveloped countries , where these vital medicines are often in short supply , if not completely unavailable .
not only would poppy licensing address the poverty and hunger crises that have engulfed the south of Afghanistan ; it also would stabilize existing local structures , giving communities a reason to support President Hamid Karzai &apos;s government and the international community .
farmers would gain a sense of ownership in counter @-@ narcotics efforts , in sharp contrast to the current idealistic - and evidently un @-@ achievable - policy of crop eradication .
we must have the backing of the Afghan people if we are to defeat the Taliban .
by endorsing such an initiative , the international community would demonstrate that it is in Afghanistan for the good of the local population , which would help farmers sever ties with the insurgency .
but for such a system to be successful , the extreme poverty in the south of the country must first be our top priority .
according to the World Food Program , 70 % of the population lack food security .
an immediate injection of emergency food and medical aid is urgently needed to break the vicious circle of suffering and violence .
only then could a new , long @-@ term development strategy in Afghanistan - one that admits that the international community is not winning the war , and that the status quo is unacceptable - be implemented .
licensing the opium crop would be a realistic and pragmatic cornerstone of that strategy &apos;s success .
the Western Alliance in the Digital Age
Munich - This weekend , Helmut Schmidt and Henry Kissinger will participate in a discussion at the Munich Security Conference ( MSC ) - just as they did a half @-@ century ago , when they took part in the first &quot; Internationale Wehrkunde @-@ Begegnung &quot; ( the forerunner of today &apos;s conference ) .
in the meantime , many developments around the world have given us reason to rejoice - but also to reflect .
it is not only the crises extending from Ukraine to Syria that will prevent the MSC , the fiftieth , from becoming an exercise in self @-@ celebration .
the transatlantic partnership , traditionally the backbone of the conference , has seen better days than these .
the United States has now at least recognized that a great deal of trust has been lost in recent months , owing to the scale of surveillance undertaken by its National Security Agency .
President Barack Obama &apos;s speech about reforms of US intelligence @-@ gathering activities , as well as his subsequent interview on German television , represented a first attempt to regain the confidence of America &apos;s allies .
but it signals , at most , the beginning of an intensive transatlantic dialogue on the issue .
the topic is too broad to be discussed solely among governments and secret services .
what we need is a more comprehensive international debate that engages , say , the American and German publics , as well as the US Congress and the German Bundestag - in short , an intra @-@ Western debate about our relationship in the digital age .
in 1963 , when Ewald von Kleist invited participants to Munich for the first conference , which Americans fondly call the &quot; Wehrkunde &quot; to this day , the motivating idea was to invite our most important allies to a discussion about the major strategic issues directly affecting Germany and NATO .
the main topic , at that time , was the Atlantic Alliance &apos;s nuclear strategy .
after all , Germany would have been the first victim of a nuclear confrontation between NATO and the Warsaw Pact countries .
Kleist wanted to contribute to the creation of a German &quot; strategic community , &quot; which could make its own contributions to the NATO debate , rather than just absorbing whatever their technologically superior US ally proposed .
in a way , we are in a similar situation today .
though the security implications of the digital age are less tangible and not as destructive as a nuclear attack , the technological possibilities fundamentally alter the playing field of international relations .
the revelations concerning the NSA &apos;s surveillance activities are just the start .
a future of &quot; thinking drones &quot; and defensive and offensive cyber weapons raises new ethical , legal , and political questions .
we Europeans need to be self @-@ critical and admit that we are not only lagging behind in terms of technical capabilities ; we are also in danger of not fully grasping in time the possibilities and dangers of the digital world .
and of course , we will hardly be able to engage in meaningful negotiations with the Americans on cyber issues unless we succeed in establishing a united stance within the European Union .
doing so would put us in far better position to negotiate on equal terms with the US , just as we can on trade issues .
in the past , the Western allies &quot; participation in NATO and its Nuclear Planning Group accommodated their concerns and prevented them from becoming mere objects of US strategy .
today , we need similar initiatives with regard to the digital world .
those hoping to achieve true cooperation must be willing to make their own contributions .
this year &apos;s MSC will include not only security officials from many countries .
three dozen German MPs and a significant US Congressional delegation will also participate .
that is why the conference is an excellent opportunity to step up the transatlantic debate .
after all , let &apos;s be honest : there will be real changes in US intelligence agencies &quot; behavior only if Congress regulates their activities more strictly .
the revelations and resulting debates in recent months have shown that many US politicians are also uneasy about the liberties taken by the secret services .
however , without domestic pressure , little will change .
it is all the more important that societal stakeholders - companies , NGOs , or international commissions of experts - both here and in the US become more heavily involved than before .
this issue affects us all .
the debate is not - and should not be - between Europe and the US .
some Americans are grateful for Edward J. Snowden &apos;s revelations about the NSA , which they believe have stimulated urgently needed public deliberation .
the institutionally assured possibility of self @-@ criticism is , arguably , the West &apos;s best characteristic - its outstanding trait .
our democracies are better organized than other systems to scrutinize their own policies and respond to criticism .
in the 1960 &quot; s , the West had to agree on a common strategy for the nuclear age , and learn to deal with the atomic threat .
subsequently , we were able to take the first steps toward arms control and disarmament .
today , we need a similar debate in the West regarding our strategy for the digital age if we want to overcome new challenges without denying our identity as liberal democracies .
this weekend in Munich , the Schmidts and Kissingers of today and tomorrow will have an opportunity to engage in what is probably the most important strategic debate of our time : how to prevent the West from falling apart inthe digital age .
Germany &apos;s Same Old Foreign Policy
Munich - More than ten weeks after its general election , Germany continues to be without a new government .
but , though the post @-@ election coalition negotiations have been unusually prolonged , there is little disagreement between the parties over foreign and security policy .
indeed , when Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) finally presented their coalition agreement on November 27 , the working group on foreign and security policy had been finished with its job for two weeks .
except for a few tweaks that generally resonate more at home than with Germany &apos;s European and international partners ( such as requiring the government to be more transparent concerning arms exports to autocratic regimes ) , continuity and caution will remain the watchwords of German foreign and security policy .
observers may disagree about whether German leaders &quot; stance provides a welcome sign of reliability or reflects a lamentable lack of diplomatic ambition .
those who hope for more active German leadership may well be disappointed by the new government .
big ideas , or even big questions , are notably absent from the coalition agreement .
this is very much a reflection of many Germans &quot; views about themselves and their future : they are comfortable with the status quo , see no need for further reform proposals , are not interested in grand strategy , and would largely prefer to be left alone .
consider NATO policy .
successive German governments have maintained that the alliance should be , or even is , the place to discuss and decide on key security challenges .
but Germany has at times been rather reluctant to take crisis issues to NATO headquarters .
and when it comes to provision of military and civilian security beyond what the coalition agreement calls &quot; our geographic neighborhood , &quot; the incoming government will favor enabling other regional organizations to do the job .
or consider the question of Turkey &apos;s accession to the European Union .
continuing disagreement between the coalition partners will not permit a proactive German role .
instead , the compromise solution will be no solution : neither yes nor no .
at the same time , some interesting new perspectives appear in the coalition agreement .
for starters , the United States &quot; strategic &quot; pivot &quot; to the Asia @-@ Pacific region is described as an opportunity for Europe to assert a coordinated foreign policy that finally plays a role in the development of cooperative policies in the region .
moreover , to encourage this outcome , the coalition agreement promises that the government will &quot; adopt new initiatives to strengthen and deepen the Common Foreign and Security Policy &quot; after the EU summit in December 2013 .
it includes a call for an annual European Council session on security and defense , as well as for a strategic debate about the purpose of EU foreign relations .
in addition , the German government will support European defense integration and maintain the establishment of a European army as a long @-@ term goal .
this may not amount to much in practice , but the language in this section is much less tepid than elsewhere .
finally , the coalition agreement responds to concerns about Germany &apos;s ability to be a reliable partner in NATO and EU military missions in a potentially more integrated EU defense organization .
according to a 1994 ruling by Germany &apos;s Constitutional Court , the German parliament has the final say when it comes to deploying soldiers .
however , Germany &apos;s partners will hardly agree to integrate forces further if the German parliament were to retain a veto over their deployment .
the coalition partners disagree about how urgent it is to sort out this issue .
nonetheless , they have agreed that , within a year , a commission will provide different options and models to protect the German parliament &apos;s rights while providing assurances to Germany &apos;s European partners that the country will be a reliable contributor to troop deployments .
should the SPD , which will vote on the coalition agreement in early December , block the formation of the new government ( an unlikely development but not entirely out of the question ) , disputes over security and defense affairs would not be the culprit .
aside from a few minor particulars , consensus prevails .
for some , that is a cause for ambivalence .
&quot; I do not like the idea that Germany plays itself up to impose its will on others , &quot; German President Joachim Gauck said recently . &quot; yet neither do I like the idea that Germany plays itself down to eschew risks or solidarity . &quot;
whether German foreign policy can and should do more is a reasonable question .
to some degree , the new coalition will feel the pressure and consider the necessity to assume more responsibility for international leadership .
but it will respond ever so slowly and ever so carefully .
the bottom line is this : expect no surprises from Germany .
considering how difficult it has been for some , if not most , other EU countries to deal with the challenges of the last five years , that is actually rather good news .
Wolfowitz and the World Bank at Bay
will World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz &apos;s troubles finally catalyze real change at the World Bank ?
will there finally be an end to the archaic practice by which the President of the United States unilaterally appoints the head of the world &apos;s most important development agency ?
facing an extraordinary rebuke from the Bank &apos;s ministerial oversight committee and open revolt from his professional staff , Wolfowitz has faint hope of limping through the last three years of his term .
the immediate uproar is over the exceedingly generous pay and promotion package that Wolfowitz awarded in 2005 to his girlfriend as compensation for leaving the Bank to pave the way for his arrival .
at a time when the Bank has been emphasizing high governance standards as the key to development , the recent revelation of that arrangement &apos;s details have dealt a serious blow to the Bank &apos;s credibility .
but even if Wolfowitz is eventually forced to resign , nothing will be gained if US President George W. Bush is allowed summarily to choose his replacement , as US Presidents have been doing ever since the Bank was founded after World War II .
instead , the Bank &apos;s head should be chosen in an open and transparent process that aims to select the best @-@ qualified candidate , whether from the US , Europe , or the developing world .
indeed , a big part of Wolfowitz &apos;s weakness today is the way he came to his job , as an in @-@ your @-@ face appointment from a US administration weak at international cooperation .
the World Bank is a development finance institution .
but Wolfowitz &apos;s background at the US State and Defense Departments gave him no real expertise or experience in either area .
instead , his claim to fame was his role as architect of America &apos;s failed war in Iraq .
by all accounts , Wolfowitz is brilliant , but it seems inconceivable that an open , transparent , and multilateral selection process would have chosen him to head the World Bank .
I reach this conclusion even though I am sympathetic to the Bush administration &apos;s desire to catalyze change at the Bank .
I have long advocated shifting the Bank &apos;s center of gravity from lending to outright grants , a policy that the Bush administration strongly endorses .
but choosing someone with no obvious background or experience in economic development was not the way to make progress on this front .
a more open selection process , indeed , would have zoomed in on the fact that Wolfowitz &apos;s girlfriend worked at the Bank .
this may seem a trivial issue , but it is not , given the Bank &apos;s strong policies to protect against nepotism .
if Wolfowitz were otherwise overwhelmingly the most qualified candidate , the selection committee may have found a way to finesse the issue , openly and transparently .
but , given his questionable fit for the job in the first place , the girlfriend issue might have been disqualifying .
why does the world meekly go along with the status quo and let the US dictate the Bank &apos;s top position ?
it is a sorry tale of poor global governance .
Europe does not get in America &apos;s way because it wants to maintain Europe &apos;s equally out @-@ dated privilege of appointing the head of the International Monetary Fund , the Bank &apos;s sister institution .
Asia has little choice but to defer to the US and Europe &apos;s shenanigans because it is grossly under @-@ represented in both organizations .
as for Africa , its leaders are loath to do or say anything that might interrupt the flow of World Bank largesse .
many people , including myself , have long complained about the leadership selection process at the World Bank and the IMF .
how can the Bank and the Fund continue to go around lecturing developing economies on good governance and transparency but fail to allow change in their own houses ?
now and again , both organizations pay lip service to the issue .
but so far , they have exhibited no real desire for change .
to be fair , the IMF &apos;s leadership is making a determined effort to give dynamic emerging economies , particularly in Asia , a bigger say in Fund governance .
if carried far enough , this process would ultimately catalyze the necessary changes .
unfortunately , the IMF &apos;s rebalancing efforts are proceeding at a glacial pace .
at the World Bank , nothing seems to be happening at all .
perhaps when Gordon Brown becomes the UK &apos;s next prime minister , he will be able to convince the G7 group of rich countries to lead the charge for change .
as head of the Fund &apos;s ministerial oversight committee , Brown understands the issues as well as anyone .
or perhaps the Wolfowitz debacle will prove to be the catalyst .
maybe at last , the next World Bank or IMF president will come from outside their usual domains .
there are plenty of great potential non @-@ American candidates .
South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel has ably served as head of the World Bank &apos;s oversight committee and would make a brilliant World Bank president .
and it still could be a qualified American .
what about Bill Clinton ?
one way or the other , the Bank and the IMF leadership selection process urgently needs to be revamped .
what the Wolfowitz debacle tells us most clearly is that the time for patience with the status quo is over .
women and Development
Copenhagen - A girl born in South Asia or sub @-@ Saharan Africa faces a cruel double burden .
she will grow up in a region beset by poverty , disease , war or famine .
she will also confront these challenges with the added disadvantage of being female .
although more attention is being given to gender issues , inequality persists in every culture , country , and continent .
a new study for the Copenhagen Consensus project shows that eliminating this disparity is an investment with high payoffs .
despite global interest in education for all , many girls in poor countries continue to be denied basic education ; right from the start , they are disadvantaged .
three in five illiterate children in the world are girls .
particularly in South Asia and sub @-@ Saharan Africa , cultural norms and economic hardships stop parents from sending their daughters to school or from keeping them in school for as long as they enroll their sons .
this unequal investment is neither equitable nor efficient .
an obvious solution is to build more schools in places where girls and boys must be educated separately .
in poor Muslim countries like Pakistan , Yemen , and Morocco , single @-@ sex schooling is the norm , but many rural areas can afford only one public school , which is usually set aside for boys .
in theory , about half of the education gap in these areas could be closed by building girls &quot; schools .
elsewhere , supply constraints are not the problem .
instead , policymakers must find ways to strengthen the incentives for parents to send their daughters to school .
in countries where the family &apos;s cost of schooling girls is lowered either by a no @-@ fee policy or by a stipend for girls who enroll in school , girls &quot; enrollment rate increases .
the experiences of these few countries lead us to propose a system whereby mothers are paid if their school @-@ age daughters attend school regularly from the 3rd to the 9th grade . this would increase girls &quot; enrollment and also put money into women &apos;s hands - important because studies show that money given to women is more likely to provide positive nutritional and health benefits for their children than money given to men .
it also provides the women with greater bargaining power in their own households .
the annual cost per pupil would be $ 32 .
covering every eligible girl in sub @-@ Saharan Africa and South Asia for a year would cost $ 6 billion .
benefits from increased future wages and the reduction in health @-@ care use would be between three and 26 times higher .
pregnancy is one of the most vulnerable times for poor women ; 99 % of the 529,000 women who die annually from pregnancy @-@ related complications live in developing countries .
severe malnutrition and the absence of prenatal care during pregnancy put both mother and child at serious risk .
spending $ 3.9 billion on family planning and maternal health initiatives , such as provision of emergency contraception in sub @-@ Saharan Africa and South Asia , could avert 1.4 million infant deaths and 142,000 pregnancy @-@ related deaths in women .
making reproductive services available to women who cannot afford to pay their way can help prevent these deaths .
but such services must not shy away from promoting and providing modern contraceptive methods to avoid unwanted pregnancies .
nearly 20 % of women in developing countries report that they would like to stop having more children but are not using any form of contraception or family planning , possibly because reproductive services are not available .
for adolescent girls , early marriage or an unwanted pregnancy typically curtails schooling .
delaying marriage and childbearing allows them to gain more education and perhaps more earning opportunities , as well as improved health , education , and labor market success for their future children - benefits worth ten times more than the cost of providing reproductive services .
other tools , aside from schooling , can help women improve their income @-@ earning ability .
microfinance institutions , such as Bangladesh &apos;s Grameen Bank , play a vital role in allowing self @-@ employed women to build profitable businesses .
small loans empower women by giving them more control over household assets and resources , more autonomy and decision @-@ making power , and greater access to participation in public life .
women are more likely than men to meet regular repayments and to spend their earnings on children &apos;s health and education .
policymakers should continue to facilitate the rollout of microfinance programs .
studies show that each dollar loaned by a microfinance institution increases household expenditure by almost 10 % in the first year , and that the benefits will continue for another 30 years .
benefits are estimated to end up about six times higher than the costs .
though women have the right to vote in almost every country , gender inequalities in political representation remain large .
governments should consider gender quotas at the local level of politics .
greater female representation may not necessarily lead to more emphasis on &quot; female &quot; policy priorities , but in India , village councils with gender quotas for village chiefs have higher levels of safe drinking water , better immunization coverage and roads , and less bribery .
there may be some losses from electing women because they tend to have less political experience than men , but the record in India suggests that if it took 20 years to establish a 30 % share of women in local positions in other countries , the benefits would be at least double the costs of achieving this .
being a woman need not and should not be among the greatest challenges of life .
the Next stage of Women &apos;s Emancipation ?
London - February 6 , 2018 , marked the centenary of the Representation of the People Act , which enfranchised ( some ) women in Britain for the first time - a reward for women &apos;s work during World War I. In honor of this historic event , statues of two leaders in the struggle for women &apos;s suffrage , Millicent Fawcett and Emmeline Pankhurst , are to be erected in British cities .
the economic emancipation of women had to wait till after World War II , when permanent male labor shortages - the result , incidentally , of Keynesian full @-@ employment policies - pulled ever more women out of domesticity and into factories and shops .
this second wave of emancipation concentrated on economic inequalities , especially discrimination in job selection and disparities in pay and property rights .
these battles have also mainly been won .
discrimination in inheritance is long gone , and equal pay for equal work is accepted in theory , though a gender bias persists ( as it does for selection to senior posts ) .
for example , Carrie Gracie recently resigned as the BBC &apos;s China editor in protest against unequal pay between male and female editors , shaming six top male employees to agree to substantial wage cuts .
it is only a matter of time - of overcoming habit , prejudice , and inertia - before what is accepted in principle becomes practice .
the most interesting remaining argument for unequal treatment relates to activities for which there is a premium on physical qualities , as in sport .
in traditional societies , men did the fighting , because they were stronger , faster , and taller .
not surprisingly , one of the last remaining bastions of unequal pay today is in competitive sport , which is a ritualized form of warfare .
in most major sports , there are separate men &apos;s and women &apos;s teams and events , with lower standards of performance expected of women .
for example , men &apos;s tennis matches often comprise up to five sets , compared to three for women .
the best men can beat the best women because they are stronger , hit the ball harder , and have more stamina .
in swimming , the longest race for men is 1,500 meters , while for women it is 800 meters .
one sport in which women compete equally with men is equestrianism - not just racing , but also Dressage , show jumping , and three @-@ day eventing .
the question is whether pay ought to be equal in an area in which performance is unequal &quot; by nature . &quot;
in tennis , the principle of equal pay for unequal performance is accepted for grand slam events , but not for many others .
elsewhere , the gender pay gap remains striking , notably in football ( soccer ) .
the captain of England &apos;s professional women &apos;s team , Steph Houghton , is paid just £ 65,000 ( $ 90,000 ) a year , whereas Neymar , the world &apos;s most expensive male player , receives roughly 500 times as much .
and while players in England &apos;s women &apos;s super league earn an annual wage of up to £ 35,000 , Chelsea &apos;s male players are paid , on average , a staggering £ 4.5 million .
one argument frequently made for equalizing pay is that sportswomen put in as much effort as sportsmen to produce their results .
this harks back to the old labor theory of value , which contended that all value was created by work .
but the link between hours of work and market prices is almost non @-@ existent in practice , which is why economists needed a different explanation for market prices .
economists today say that prices ( including wages and salaries ) are determined by consumer demand .
what a thing costs depends not on the amount of time and effort spent producing it , but on what it is worth to the buyer .
male footballers are paid more than female players because their services are more in demand .
if women &apos;s football teams started paying their players the same as men &apos;s teams , they would go bankrupt .
unemployment is the price of insisting on being paid above the &quot; market @-@ clearing &quot; level .
market prices , economists insist , do not measure moral worth but market worth .
if we want market @-@ determined rewards to equate with &quot; just &quot; rewards , we either have to abolish markets - the socialist solution - or restructure individual preferences .
one argument is that women in sport would command the same market price as men , if only structural gender biases , such as greater media coverage and sponsorship for men &apos;s sports , were removed .
although market value may be determined by consumer demand , as economic theory has it , these preferences are themselves the result of socially structured gender biases .
in the absence of these biases , demand for women &apos;s sports - as measured by attendance at matches , television ratings , and so on - would equal demand for men &apos;s sports .
this argument is based on the assumption - which extends far beyond sports - that real gender equality will not be achieved until the formation of tastes and habits is no longer subject to gender stereotypes .
boys would not automatically be given toy guns , while girls are given dolls .
this sounds reasonable enough , until one recognizes the lengths to which radical feminists are willing to go to re @-@ engineer tastes and preferences .
language is being systematically purged of &quot; gender bias . &quot;
University courses in humanities and social sciences are being subjected to implicit or explicit forms of gender censorship .
gender itself is increasingly seen as &quot; socially constructed &quot; ; and children , therefore , should be encouraged to choose their own gender .
to me , the latest offensive against men is a good cause gone mad .
but then , as a 78 @-@ year @-@ old white male , I would think that , wouldn &apos;t I ?
women for Integration
Copenhagen - The past decade has proven again and again that empowering women worldwide holds the key to solving many seemingly intractable issues that have otherwise stymied policymakers . poverty in the developing world seemed ineradicable until micro @-@ lenders saw millions of low @-@ income , destitute women as potential entrepreneurs .
involving African women in decision @-@ making about crop production turns out to enable environmentally sustainable farming practices .
runaway population growth becomes controllable when women have access to literacy and business opportunities as well as to contraception .
could the tensions and conflicts surrounding the issue of immigration in Europe be yet another issue for which the empowerment of women holds a solution ?
in a recent visit to Copenhagen to commemorate International Women &apos;s Day , I took part in many conversations that duplicate others throughout Europe : citizens from across the political spectrum were struggling with the issue of non @-@ European immigration and the cultural tensions that have ensued .
what does it mean to be Danish , German , or French in the presence of these millions of newcomers , most of whom come from non @-@ democratic societies ?
some of this anxiety is pure racism ; but some is not .
what would &quot; integration &quot; mean , and how is it achieved without the loss of cherished civil @-@ society values ?
these are not necessarily xenophobic questions : a post @-@ enlightenment civil society , with a free press and due process , is a precious thing , and those values should not be sacrificed to politically correct moral relativism .
this issue has been given new urgency by the arrests in Ireland of alleged jihadists from several countries who are accused of plotting to murder a Swedish cartoonist who drew an image of the prophet Mohammed as a dog .
across Europe , the discussions are growing more intense as anti @-@ immigration platforms gain supporters in otherwise liberal countries , from Germany to France to traditionally inclusive and tolerant Denmark itself .
then I witnessed the prototype of a true solution .
I met Elisabeth Møller Jensen , the director of KVINFO , &quot; the Danish center for information on gender , equality and ethnicity &quot; - an extraordinary organization funded by Denmark &apos;s Ministry of Culture .
one of its many innovative programs is already showing results in terms of genuinely integrating immigrant families into Danish society .
by addressing immigrant women - and by viewing them as potential leaders , rather than as quiescent potential maids or service workers - KVINFO is enabling their families to witness the benefits of an open civil society in their own lives .
KVINFO began a &quot; mentor network &quot; aimed at immigrant and refugee women in 2002 .
by 2010 , it had 5,000 participants , had won awards and international acclaim for best integrative practices , and is being replicated throughout Denmark - and observers are exploring programs or partnerships modeled upon it in Canada , Spain , Portugal , and Norway .
the program pairs refugee and immigrant women in a one @-@ to @-@ one mentoring relationship with women who are established leaders at all levels of Danish society .
the pairing is not cursory .
a careful matchmaking process unites the interests and goals of the women on both sides , and already has paid amazing dividends .
women who were journalists , engineers , or scientists in their countries of origin - and who could not get jobs as checkout cashiers in Denmark - have been paired with Danish counterparts and are now back in school , or working in research .
but even women who arrive with no higher education or professional skills create an &quot; action plan . &quot;
they learn from their mentors what options there are , how to proceed , and what to do to reach their objectives .
as they enter the workforce , their language skills improve , their household income soars , and their children see firsthand a woman in a respected , economically valued role .
their loved ones thus learn how to thrive in a European context - occasionally coming to KVINFO events and benefiting from their mothers &quot; expanding network of contacts .
so , rather than feeling exploited and condemned indefinitely to the fringes of a Northern European society - and thus vulnerable to the stirrings of demagogues and extremists - these women &apos;s children grow up fully familiar with Danish civil society , well informed about higher education and professional opportunities , and hopeful rather than cynical .
by empowering women , the whole family is lifted up and , in a supportive rather than a colonizing way , &quot; Europeanized &quot; in the best sense .
I am often struck by the way many Europeans use arms @-@ length euphemisms when talking about immigrants : they want immigrants to feel &quot; welcome &quot; or &quot; comfortable . &quot; I always wonder , &quot; But do you want them to feel French , or German , or Norwegian ? &quot;
to be fully integrated , Muslim and other newcomers to European countries must be welcomed not as perpetual visitors - even if , ideally , as nicely treated visitors - but rather as family members , as the American model does ( or aspires to do ) .
as Møller Jensen put it , &quot; I want these children to feel Danish . &quot;
these young people and Denmark itself will benefit , as this &quot; KVINFO generation &quot; grows up with a genuine stake in Danish civil society , and seeing the world as Danes , not as guests .
Arab Women &apos;s Unfinished Revolution
fez - Though women across the Middle East participated actively in the Arab Spring protests that began in late 2010 , they remain second @-@ class citizens , even where popular uprisings managed to topple autocratic regimes .
indeed , the Islamist governments now in power in several countries seem more determined than the despots that they replaced to keep women out of politics .
in conducting interviews with women in the region , I am struck by their overall pessimism .
they fear the loss of their rights .
they see economic disintegration all around them , raising the possibility of a further increase in violence .
as social bonds fray , they feel increasingly vulnerable .
more than once , I heard them express the view that things were better before the revolutions .
female representation in parliaments and government cabinets after the Arab Spring has been either absent or meager , and women activists worry that Islamist parties will implement reactionary policies that discriminate on the basis of gender .
in Egypt , for example , the Freedom and Justice Party , which dominates the parliament , claims that a woman cannot become President .
Egyptian women were heavily represented in the protests that brought down former President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s regime in 2011 , but they have been largely excluded from any official decision @-@ making role ever since .
in Morocco , while there were eightwomen in the previous cabinet , today there is only one in the Islamist @-@ led government .
in January , the Islamist @-@ dominated parliament adopted a decree lowering the age of marriage for girls from 18 to 16 , a major setback .
Moroccan feminists have protested vigorously , but to no avail .
parliamentary representation for women has also taken a hit .
women hold less than 1 % of seats in the current Egyptian parliament ; previously , they held 12 % .
in Libya , a first draft of the electoral law reserved 10 % of seats in the constituent assembly for women , but the quota was later abandoned .
in Tunisia , the election in 2011 brought 49 women into the 217 @-@ seat Constituent Assembly .
but 42 of these women are members of Ennahda , which regards Sharia ( Islamic law ) as the source of legislation .
long @-@ time Tunisian activists fear that Ennahda , which dominates the assembly , will use the presence of women MPs to restrict women &apos;s rights .
the recent assassination of the secular Tunisian opposition leader Chokri Belaid has raised the stakes for women there .
Belaid was a voice on behalf of women &apos;s rights , and the threat of increased political violence will focus on those who advocate secular equality for all Tunisians , including women .
unfortunately , conservative forces in the Arab world repeatedly turn against women when political unrest spreads .
in Bahrain , several women protesters have been arrested and tortured .
in Yemen , the authorities call on male relatives to &quot; tame &quot; their women .
in Tunisia , the most Westernized of the Arab countries , women have been attacked at universities and schools , and are being forced to wear the hijab .
a woman who was allegedly raped by two policemen in September 2012 was charged with public indecency when she filed a complaint .
likewise , in Egypt , women protesters face greater scrutiny than men .
those arrested by the military during the anti @-@ Mubarak protests were subjected to virginity tests as a form of intimidation .
across the Middle East , Islamist militias have harassed , arrested , raped , and tortured women pro @-@ democracy activists .
the model of Iran &apos;s Islamic Revolution in 1979 , which imposed second @-@ class citizenship on women , is frequently cited as a threat in Arab countries now ruled by Islamist parties .
these countries are at a crossroads .
women make up half of the Middle East &apos;s population , and any hope of political and economic development must account for that fact .
organizations like the United Nations Development Program have repeatedly issued reports demonstrating the connection between economic decline and oppression of women .
simply put , the Arab countries will not succeed unless women are fully integrated into political and economic life .
in her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech in 2011 , Yemeni political activist Tawakkol Karman , made the point clearly : &quot; the solution to women &apos;s issues can only be achieved in a free and democratic society in which human energy is liberated , the energy of both women and men together . &quot;
Middle Eastern countries should protect and consolidate women &apos;s rights as a way to reinforce democratic ideas and habits .
they must institute the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international laws and agreements in order to eradicate gender @-@ based discrimination and violence .
the hope for women &apos;s progress is really a hope for a decent society in which development for all is possible .
a Woman &apos;s Place Is in the Digital Revolution
Montreal - Digital technologies are a double @-@ edged sword for the world &apos;s women .
men &apos;s greater access to these technologies puts women at risk of being left even further behind economically and socially .
but if women can tap the full power of digital technologies , vital new opportunities will open up for them .
according to estimates by the GSM Association , women &apos;s access to the Internet and mobile phones is about 85 % of the level for men , on average , and a total of 1.7 billion women in low- and middle @-@ income countries are unconnected .
this severely limits the prospects of women and girls .
digital technologies enhance women &apos;s access to finance , with mobile banking enabling them to avoid long journeys to a branch or ATM .
likewise , technology @-@ enabled health care delivered via phone or tablet improves health outcomes , as it reaches women even in the remotest areas , sparing them a long and often risky trek to see a doctor .
the timesaving potential of digital technologies is so great that they may make the difference in enabling women to seek paid employment .
today , women undertake three @-@ quarters of all unpaid care work , producing output of around $ 10 trillion , or 13 % of global GDP - none of which is translated into income , let alone economic power .
by their nature , e @-@ commerce and technology @-@ based businesses offer women more flexibility and autonomy , helping them to manage home responsibilities alongside paid work .
in Indonesia , women @-@ owned businesses generate 35 % of e @-@ commerce revenue , compared with only 15 % of the revenue of offline businesses .
likewise , in China , 55 % of new Internet businesses are founded by women , and Alibaba &apos;s Taobao e @-@ commerce platform has an equal number of male and female store owners .
in fact , China is home to 114 of the world &apos;s 147 self @-@ made female billionaires , compared to just 14 in the second @-@ place country , the United States .
women &apos;s economic empowerment is good not just for the women who benefit .
the McKinsey Global Institute ( MGI ) has estimated that advancing gender equality could add $ 12 trillion per year to the world economy by 2025 .
in the Asia @-@ Pacific region alone , getting more women into full @-@ time employment in higher @-@ paid , higher @-@ productivity sectors could add $ 4.5 trillion per year to GDP , 12 % above the current trajectory .
at the company level , a growing body of evidence shows that more gender equality is good for bottom lines .
greater diversity of leadership styles improves the quality of decision @-@ making . if given the opportunity , women could be leading innovators in the age of automation and artificial intelligence , and could help to ensure that algorithms are free of gender bias .
but major barriers prevent women from seizing these opportunities .
for example , in India , where only 29 % of all Internet users are female , girls in rural areas often face gender @-@ based restrictions on their use of information and communications technologies .
one village in Uttar Pradesh implemented a fine for any girl using a mobile phone outside the home .
beyond the social attitudes that undermine women &apos;s access to digital technologies , women and girls often disproportionately lack the requisite skills to seize the opportunities of the digital age .
in Singapore , for example , women lag behind men in education in science , math , engineering , and technology .
at Nanyang Technological University , females comprised only 27 % of the undergraduate computer @-@ science program in 2015 @-@ 2016 , despite accounting for half of all undergraduates at the university .
what is at stake is not just women &apos;s ability to seize the opportunities offered by the digital revolution , but also their capacity to withstand the coming wave of automation .
according to MGI research , in Singapore alone , 800,000 full @-@ time @-@ equivalent jobs could be displaced by 2030 due to automation .
the jobs that are most vulnerable to automation are the low @-@ paid , lower @-@ skill jobs that women are more likely to hold .
at the same time , though automation risks disrupting many jobs ( or tasks within jobs ) for both men and women , it also takes some of the drudgery out of current work , tailoring it to human abilities .
the result could be higher wages that contribute to the creation of more new jobs - 300 @-@ 365 million worldwide - as spending increases , with emerging economies gaining the most .
furthermore , among the new jobs that will be created will be many in fields like education and health care , where women have traditionally thrived .
according to MGI research , more than 100 million jobs could be created over the next 10 @-@ 15 years as health care and education needs grow .
it is not yet clear exactly how automation will affect women &apos;s employment .
but there is no doubt that protecting - and even enhancing - women &apos;s job and income prospects will require upgrading their skills , so that they can take advantage of the new and changing opportunities created by the ongoing digital revolution .
the success of women in e @-@ commerce attests to the power of digital technologies to level the economic playing field , to the benefit of individual women , their communities and societies , and the world economy .
more women in work - particularly in the technology industries that are shaping our collective future - would be good news for all .
the Media &apos;s # MeToo Problem
London - Journalism classrooms may be dominated by women , but global media are still ruled by men , who occupy the majority of management positions , report more news stories and are more frequently presented as expert voices .
this imbalance is reflected in the content newsrooms produce , with fewer written words and broadcast seconds dedicated to telling women &apos;s stories .
it is also reflected in the industry &apos;s culture , which leaves women more vulnerable to sexual harassment and abuse .
given the importance of relationship @-@ building in media , not to mention the desire for connection among journalists who cover extreme or harrowing events in difficult environments , intimate ties can easily form among colleagues and associates .
the problem arises when these relationships turn sour or , worse , when they are non @-@ consensual or based on coercion , such as when a more senior colleague pursues a sexual relationship with a subordinate .
of course , across countries , there can be significant differences in what is considered predatory or inappropriate behavior .
but , globally , almost half of women journalists report having experienced work @-@ related sexual harassment , according to a 2014 study by the International News Safety Institute ( INSI ) and the International Women &apos;s Media Foundation ( IWMF ) .
two @-@ thirds reported that they had faced &quot; intimidation , threats , or abuse , &quot; mostly by bosses , supervisors , or co @-@ workers .
for perpetrators , impunity remains the norm .
almost three @-@ fifths of respondents in the INSI / IWMF study who had experienced harassment said that they had reported incidents to their employers .
in most cases , however , it was the women who experienced the abuse who suffered adverse consequences : damaged reputations and career prospects , not to mention the impact on their psychological and emotional wellbeing .
so while men with histories of predatory behavior continue to occupy senior positions in the global news industry , women journalists are pushed to the point that they consider leaving it .
in a recent survey by the IWMF and TrollBusters , one @-@ third of respondents said that they had considered abandoning journalism ; those at earlier stages in their careers were twice as likely to say that they were considering work in other fields because of the threats and attacks they received , in person or online .
despite the obstacles they face , more women appear to be rising in the ranks of the global media industry , even though progress is relatively slow .
in digital newsrooms , which often have fewer of the inherent inequities of legacy media , the number of women in leadership positions appears to be growing faster .
however , the &quot; bro &quot; culture in certain newer newsrooms carries its own sexual harassment risks for women .
meanwhile , in the United States , several high @-@ profile male journalists have lost their jobs in the last year over allegations of inappropriate behavior toward their female colleagues - part of the broader # MeToo movement .
but , overall , newsrooms continue to fail to take seriously the threats female journalists face on the job , both in their own workplaces and in the field .
while newsrooms conduct risk assessment and deployment discussions regarding journalists in the field - where women can be particularly vulnerable to unwelcome advances from male colleagues , contacts , or strangers - they rarely account for the specific threats women face , at least not in a sufficiently nuanced way .
this may be partly because , for major news organizations , these assessments are often handled in consultation with safety advisers - usually former military men , who may not fully appreciate the particular risks women face .
sometimes , the safety advisers turn out to be perpetrators of sexual harassment .
anecdotally , I know of several journalists who have been sexually harassed by safety advisers .
depending on where this takes place , such behavior can have significant security implications .
as if that were not enough pressure , female foreign correspondents who are assaulted in the field often find themselves at the center of debates about whether women should be deployed on certain stories at all .
male correspondents are never the subjects of such debates .
this macho myopia reinforces the damaging imbalance in perspectives shaping the media . it also carries significant economic costs .
as the Harvard Business Review put it , &quot; we all pay the price &quot; when sexual harassment continues or is covered up .
by impeding women from advancing within the industry or compelling them to change jobs , harassment diminishes their earning potential and deprives society of the best use of its talents .
the fact is that journalists of various genders , ethnicities , and backgrounds experience different environments differently , in terms of both the risks they face and the rewards they can reap .
any assessment of a story needs to account for that nuance , with managers choosing the best journalist for the job - and providing the support needed to keep all journalists safe .
to change the organizational culture that has enabled harassment and other forms of abuse against women - a moral obligation , as well as a legal and economic imperative - newsroom managers must lead from the top .
change will not happen overnight , nor will it be driven by a single actor .
leaders should listen to the women in their ranks , and invite diverse perspectives to help effect change .
the goal is not to pit young against old or women against men .
it is to rectify the media industry &apos;s failure to protect its most vulnerable workers .
we all pay when that failure prevents women journalists from achieving their full potential .
it &apos;s Time to Let Women thrive
Davos - In public debates around the world , women &apos;s empowerment is increasingly being recognized as a top priority .
the question of how to provide more economic opportunities for women is firmly on the agenda at the World Economic Forum &apos;s annual meeting in Davos this year .
and longtime advocates for women are feeling energized , as countless others - men and women alike - have come to recognize the urgency of the task .
affording women and girls the opportunity to succeed is not just the right thing to do ; it can also transform societies and economies for the good of all .
for example , bringing women &apos;s labor force participation up to the same level as that of men would boost GDP by as much as 9 % in Japan and 27 % in India .
the International Monetary Fund has documented many other macroeconomic benefits associated with women &apos;s empowerment .
reducing gender gaps in employment and education has been shown to help economies diversify their exports .
appointing more women to banking @-@ supervision boards can prevent cozy groupthink , thereby ensuring greater stability and resilience in the financial sector .
and reducing gender inequalities also reduces income inequality , allowing for more sustainable growth .
closing the gender gap may seem like a tall order , but it is essential for long @-@ term economic development and prosperity .
the challenge for every country , then , is to make the most of all of its people &apos;s talents .
realizing women &apos;s potential is a universal mission .
but some of the barriers holding women back are also universal .
astonishingly , almost 90 % of countries have one or more gender @-@ based legal restrictions on the books .
in some countries , women still have limited property rights compared to men ; in others , husbands have the right to forbid their wives from working .
beyond legal barriers , women also face social and cultural obstacles that limit their access to education , work , and finance .
this is especially true in countries with fragile political systems .
now that public awareness of is growing , it is time to press ahead with concrete measures to help women remain in the workforce while raising a family .
for a glimpse of what that might look like , consider Norway , where affordable childcare and parental @-@ leave schemes have proven successful in enabling both mothers and fathers to work .
yes , these programs are costly .
but they are well worth the investment , given employed women &apos;s enormous contribution to economic growth .
moreover , programs that help women keep working also change the role of fathers .
in Norway and other countries with similar policies , fathers now share equally in parental leave and child @-@ rearing .
as a result , more women can pursue leadership roles in work and public life .
of course , countries that are not yet at Norway &apos;s level of economic development typically face other gender @-@ related challenges , including limited access to water and education .
unfortunately , while many countries have made progress in reducing gender gaps in primary @-@ school enrollment , there is still much more work to be done at the secondary and tertiary levels . as long as these gaps persist , women will not be able to aspire to political and economic power on an equal footing with men .
accordingly , Norway has made girls &quot; education a top priority in its international @-@ development programs .
beyond education , ensuring that women in developing countries have access to finance is critical , because it enables them to participate fully in the economy , including as entrepreneurs .
when women are empowered to start their own businesses , they can drive innovation and help their countries prosper .
because women &apos;s labor @-@ force participation is so important for growth , organizations such as the IMF are committed to working with governments around the world to empower women economically .
IMF @-@ supported programs in Egypt and Jordan , for example , include measures to boost investment in public nurseries and safe public transportation .
in addition to specific policies , today &apos;s conversation has increasingly focused on the need for wider social change .
and now that movements such as # Equalpay and # MeToo have gained so much momentum , it looks like that change could be coming .
it has been inspiring to see so many women , girls , and - yes - men speaking out against retrograde attitudes toward women , which have been holding all of us back .
with the global economy recovering , governments must now lay the foundation for long @-@ term growth , by creating the conditions for women everywhere to realize their full potential .
discrimination and abuse against women can no longer stand .
it is time for women to thrive .
women on Top ?
what will G @-@ 8 summit meetings be like when American President Hillary Clinton and French President Ségolène Royal join German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a formidable triangle of women &apos;s power ?
the scenario is not altogether unlikely .
indeed , in the United States and France , there are even alternative female candidates for the presidency ( Condoleezza Rice in America , Michelle Alliot @-@ Marie in France ) .
will this mean a new style of both domestic politics and international relations ?
the answer is not obvious .
after all , some women have long had the strength and the will to make it to the top . think of Indira Gandhi , Golda Meir , or Margaret Thatcher .
all three were powerful prime ministers of their countries , though perhaps not the epitome of what might be regarded as feminine values .
they all outdid men at their own game and had little time for what came to be called feminism .
indeed , another trend may be more significant as far as political leadership is concerned .
when it comes to the formation of governments , women have managed to break out of the prison of their traditional domains , such as education and social affairs .
foreign policy in particular has become a female aspiration .
both the US and the European Union have women leading their foreign offices ; so do half a dozen EU countries , including Britain .
has this changed the style , indeed , the substance of foreign policy ?
undoubtedly , a shift in policy styles is occurring in many parts of the world .
in a word , it appears that the Reagan @-@ Thatcher period is over .
while opponents of globalization still fight &quot; neo @-@ liberal &quot; policies , political discourse has taken a new turn .
words like &quot; justice &quot; are back in fashion ; there is concern about globalization &apos;s losers and the &quot; underclass . &quot;
likewise , the leader of Britain &apos;s Conservatives , David Cameron , startled more old @-@ fashioned supporters of his party by saying that people released from prison &quot; need , above all , love . &quot;
when Prime Minister Tony Blair described the next election as a fistfight in which the &quot; flyweight &quot; Cameron would be carried out and the &quot; heavyweight &quot; Brown victorious after a short bout , he got much applause from his supporters in the House of Commons , but the remark went down badly with voters .
somehow , people prefer &quot; softer &quot; values than were prevalent in the last two decades .
yet it is not the leading women who above all represent these values .
Merkel may have been softened by having to preside over a grand coalition , but her original stance was more of the Reagan @-@ Thatcher variety .
Yuliya Tymoshenko was clearly the most stouthearted among the leaders of Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution , and no one has ever described Hillary Clinton as particularly &quot; soft . &quot;
on the contrary , her possible Republican opponent in 2009 , Senator John McCain , while a war hero , is also a man who represents to many Americans the new soft values .
Merkel had a difficult time in the run @-@ up to her recent party conference , because Jürgen Rüttgers , the minister @-@ president of the largest German state , North @-@ Rhine Westphalia , reminded the Christian Democrats of their historical support for strong social @-@ welfare policies .
only Royal may be said to represent softer lines against the hard @-@ liner of the governing party , Nicolas Sarkozy .
so , have women at or near the top made no real difference to politics ?
whatever change they have brought has not been obvious .
in a sense , women &apos;s advance is simply the normal consequence of the gradual move to effective equality of opportunity that began in the 1960 &quot; s .
it took decades to become real , and there are still countries that have a long way to go .
despite Tymoshenko &apos;s leading role in Ukraine , it would be surprising to see Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced by a woman , and , while there is a female vice @-@ president in China , there is no sign of a woman becoming Japanese prime minister soon .
even so , in many parts of the world , women have made considerable headway on the path to the top .
not infrequently this has been helped by explicit policies .
David Cameron prides himself on a successful campaign to make 40 % of all Conservative parliamentary candidates in Britain are women .
but this is precisely the point .
it is not the women at the top who have changed the scene .
rather , it is a more general trend , helped along by open @-@ minded leaders of both sexes , that has changed the political climate in countries .
no one , man or woman , can today aspire to setting the tone of public discourse without recognizing that politics is no longer only a man &apos;s game .
in other words , normalization by equal opportunity is itself the change .
whatever the particular values of leading candidates , this is undoubtedly progress .
what boosts Gender Equality in Developing Countries ?
Washington , DC - On March 8 , the world will celebrate International Women &apos;s Day , an annual opportunity to recommit to gender equality .
this year &apos;s observance comes at an important time for women &apos;s rights , as global movements like # MeToo and # TimesUp are refocusing attention on the discriminatory practices that women confront in their social and professional lives .
but while women in the developed world are waging big battles over gender bias , women and girls in developing countries remain focused on smaller victories .
on this International Women &apos;s Day , we must not forget that in the world &apos;s poorest communities , poverty , hunger , domestic violence , and discrimination remain endemic obstacles to gender parity .
I have studied gender and development in the Global South for 15 years .
my research , which has included thousands of interviews with women from India to Burkina Faso , has centered on one question : how can the international community improve the welfare of the world &apos;s poorest women ?
the answer , it turns out , is to help them do what they are already doing on their own .
one of the most effective ways to empower women anywhere , but especially in the developing world , is by promoting financial independence .
in many areas , that means supporting &quot; informal savings groups , &quot; networks of like @-@ minded women who pay dues to build a shared pool of resources .
this money can then be drawn on to fund any number of items , such as small business expenses , school fees , or health @-@ care costs .
community @-@ based savings groups - there are millions in Asia and Africa alone - are changing lives every day .
I once met a woman in Burkina Faso whose son owes his life to the financial resources of a savings network .
one evening , when the boy was violently ill with diarrhea , his mother called a taxi to take him to the nearest clinic .
but taxis , like ambulances , must be paid for in advance , and the woman had no money .
fortunately , a neighbor who belonged to a health savings group was able to contribute and pay the fare .
that immediate access to cash very likely saved the boy &apos;s life .
most savings group loans are similarly small .
in Benin , for example , the average loan size in one group is just $ 9 .
but , in a country where the average annual income is less than $ 800 , small amounts can make a huge difference .
unfortunately , many savings groups , as important as they are , do not scale ; most operate in isolation from official services , which weakens their effectiveness .
women in poor communities must rely on one another , but they also need access to government and international agencies if they are ever to escape from hunger and poverty .
that is why my organization , the Grameen Foundation , is using digital technology and mobile phones to connect savings groups with other service providers .
one of our largest projects is in Burkina Faso , a desperately poor country in West Africa where an estimated 55 % of the population is food insecure for at least a portion of the year .
since 1993 , we have worked with more than 73,000 women in nearly 3,300 savings groups , bringing services directly to the women who need them .
our average participant is 40 years old , illiterate , and earns just $ 7 a week selling crops like sesame and peanut .
when we began the program , only about half of the women we worked with said they felt empowered in their homes ; many feared their husbands .
today , those sentiments are slowly changing .
by serving as a bridge between informal savings groups and banks , health centers , schools , and agricultural extension services , we are helping women make better decisions about food use , nutritional practices , and spending .
our goal is to reduce poverty rates by strengthening asset @-@ management skills , which would give women a greater voice in their communities .
&quot; gender dialogue sessions &quot; that we host are also strengthening family bonds .
during each of my field visits , I have been amazed at how these efforts are affecting women &apos;s lives .
on one recent trip , I met Rasmata , a young mother who told me that thanks to the safety net of her savings group , she was managing to support her family despite her husband &apos;s emigration abroad , her father &apos;s recent death , and a lingering drought .
she was diversifying her income , managing her finances , and even adopting climate @-@ smart farming techniques .
the best part was that she described herself as a &quot; hard @-@ working , respectful , rigorous , and ambitious woman . &quot;
those are adjectives that women everywhere , regardless of their financial situation or education , deserve to ascribe to themselves .
so this week , as the world celebrates the incredible progress that women have made on the long march to parity , I will be thinking about women like Rasmata , who have accomplished so much despite having so little .
the Myth of the Women &apos;s Vote
Washington , DC - Among the clichés that deserve to be thrown out after the recent presidential election in the United States is the idea of a &quot; women &apos;s vote . &quot;
it may seem surprising that only 54 % of the female electorate voted for Hillary Clinton , the first woman nominated for president by a major party .
but while gender is a strong marker for how Americans think about certain issues , it is not the best predictor of how they will vote .
it turns out that female candidates do not face a single gender gap , but rather multiple gender gaps .
to be sure , a superficial look at past election results reveals an enormous and persistent difference between men and women voters overall .
according to Pew Research , the last presidential election in which men and women voted the same was the 1976 contest between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford .
in this year &apos;s election , women favored Clinton by 12 percentage points , and men favored Trump by the same margin .
men favored George W. Bush by 11 points in 2000 , and women favored Obama by 13 points and 11 points in 2008 and 2012 , respectively ; but until now we have never seen double @-@ digit gaps in both directions simultaneously .
but this still does not mean that the gender gap tells us much as a first @-@ order factor , especially if we consider other gaps among demographic groups .
if we sort by race or ethnicity , we find that white Americans favored Trump by 21 points , while Hispanics and African @-@ Americans favored Clinton by 36 points and 80 points , respectively .
meanwhile , voters with different education levels were further apart than in any election since 1980 .
college @-@ educated voters backed Clinton by a nine @-@ point margin , while people without a college degree backed Trump by an eight @-@ point margin .
a New York Times analysis of exit polls found that voters with annual incomes below $ 50,000 backed Clinton by about a ten @-@ point margin , while voters with incomes above that level split evenly between the two candidates .
this indicates that , at least in this year &apos;s election , ethnicity and education were much more predictive than income .
as it happens , they were also more predictive than gender .
ninety @-@ three percent of African @-@ American women and 80 % of African @-@ American men voted for Clinton .
but 53 % of white women and 63 % of white men voted for Trump , while only 43 % of white women and 31 % of white men voted for Clinton .
similarly , Clinton won the support of white , college @-@ educated women by six points ; but she lost white non @-@ college @-@ educated women by 28 points and white non @-@ college @-@ educated men by 49 points .
and if we look just at Republican voters , the gender gap vanishes almost entirely : 91 % of Republican women and 92 % of Republican men voted for Trump .
this all points not to a single gender dynamic , but to one refracted through multiple social and economic lenses .
for example , as CBS News noted , Clinton &apos;s failure to match President Barack Obama &apos;s performance with African @-@ American voters was &quot; entirely due to black men &quot; not voting for her - though why this was the case remains unexplained .
and , despite her candidacy &apos;s historic significance , Clinton &apos;s performance with white women voters was no better than Obama &apos;s performance in 2012 .
we know that Republican women voted according to their party affiliation and not their gender .
but Trump also seems to have reached white women not affiliated with a political party , perhaps owing to his campaign &apos;s strategy of hyping women &apos;s anxiety .
this strategy &apos;s success indicates one way that gender can play a role in voter decision @-@ making .
voter data going back 50 years suggests that women , more than men , are moved by the anxiety of changing circumstances and external threats .
for example , in the 1964 presidential election , Lyndon B. Johnson &apos;s campaign aired the now @-@ famous &quot; daisy &quot; advertisement that suggested that his opponent , Barry Goldwater , would pull the US into a nuclear war ; a week later , polls found that 45 % of men , but 53 % of women , shared that concern .
similarly , George W. Bush performed 30 % better with women voters in his 2004 re @-@ election campaign than he did in his 2000 campaign , which many political analysts attribute to anxieties among white middle @-@ class &quot; security moms &quot; in the aftermath of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks .
still more recently , in the 2014 US midterm elections , Republicans emphasized the US &apos;s vulnerabilities , and aired advertisements hinting that the Islamic State was directing Ebola @-@ infected agents to kill Americans .
experts ridiculed these claims , but polling suggests that the advertisements were nevertheless effective , and a number of Democratic incumbents , and women in particular , lost elections that year .
the Democrats &quot; focus on reproductive rights had done little to sway women who were already worrying about the Islamic State and Ebola .
as I warned at the time , the 2014 election was a trial run for a 2016 strategy to defeat a woman candidate .
many political observers assumed that this strategy could not possibly work for a Republican candidate who had suggested that a debate moderator was menstruating , joked about dating his daughter , was caught on tape boasting about groping women , and was publicly accused by several women of sexual harassment and assault .
but , just as in the 2014 election , Republican @-@ leaning voters in 2016 were far more concerned about terrorism , crime , illegal immigration , and economic security than they were about issues such as sexism , racism , and inequality .
where does this leave American women ?
a female US presidential candidate has now won a majority of women &apos;s votes , and more total votes than her male opponent , and yet her strategy failed to deliver enough votes to secure a victory .
in America &apos;s polarized political culture , appeals to one group simply alienate other groups .
as long as female candidates are forced to meet multiple , contradictory gender expectations , the US will never close the most prominent gap of all : that between America and the many countries that have already chosen a woman to lead them .
making &quot; Women &apos;s Work &quot; Count
Istanbul - Over the next few months , the 12,000 employees based at Apple &apos;s headquarters in Cupertino , California will complete their move to an extravagant new campus .
the &quot; spaceship , &quot; covering 2.8 million square feet , includes a two @-@ story yoga studio , running paths , and even revolutionary pizza boxes that keep slices crisp .
one thing it does not have , however , is daycare .
when it comes to ignoring the importance of childcare for working parents , Apple is far from unique .
and that omission places a powerful drag on parents &quot; ability to achieve their economic potential , with women suffering the most .
worldwide , women carry out twice as much unpaid domestic and care work - including raising children , caring for sick or elderly family members , and managing the household - as men do .
in Mexico , India , and Turkey , women do three times more care work than men .
this &quot; gender chore gap &quot; limits women &apos;s choices , as it impedes their ability to obtain formal education , secure good jobs , and achieve equal pay .
indeed , though women around the world actually work more than men in total ( including both paid and unpaid work ) , they earn one quarter less , on average , hold only one quarter of executive positions in the private sector , and occupy less than one quarter of all seats in national parliaments .
only half of working @-@ age women worldwide are in the paid labor force , compared to more than three quarters of men .
this situation is slowly beginning to change .
unpaid household and care work is gradually shedding its reputation as &quot; women &apos;s work , &quot; and men today are assuming more household responsibilities than their fathers and grandfathers did .
some countries , particularly in Europe , are revising traditional leave policies so that parents can choose how to allocate time off after the birth of a child .
more broadly , the value of unpaid household and care work - not just for children and family members , but also for the long @-@ term health of societies and economies - is increasingly being recognized .
efforts to measure the contribution of care work to national economies have produced estimates ranging from 20 % to 60 % of GDP .
in 2015 , United Nations member states adopted the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , which call for recognizing , reducing , and redistributing unpaid care work - a measure long proposed by feminist economists and gender @-@ equality advocates .
the question now is what can actually be done to meet this objective .
the responsibility will lie , first and foremost , with governments .
after all , while businesses or neighborhood associations may offer childcare options to working parents , costs and quality vary widely .
government action is needed to ensure that care services cover all who need them - from preschool children to the sick , the disabled , and the elderly - and that they are universally accessible and affordable .
beyond services , however , achieving the SDGs &quot; targets will require policy change .
most important , governments must establish requirements for parental and family leave programs .
together with private companies , they can also provide monetary incentives for men and women to share household and care work more equally .
such policies have proved effective not only in Northern Europe - the most commonly cited model - but also in Eastern European countries like Lithuania , Estonia , and even Hungary , demonstrating that they can be applied anywhere .
at a time when many governments , particularly in the developing world , are faced with severe fiscal constraints , such interventions may seem farfetched .
but spending on the care sector should be viewed as an investment , not a cost .
a recent study in Turkey showed that one dollar of public money invested in the care sector could create 2.5 times as many jobs as a dollar invested in the construction industry .
more than half of those jobs - decent jobs that could raise incomes and living standards , particularly for poor households - would go to women .
international institutions can play an important role in helping governments to seize the opportunities presented by investment in the care sector .
in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , the United Nations Development Programme undertook an initiative that helped women who had mostly worked at home their entire lives to find jobs in the care sector , enabling them to make use of their skills , by caring for children and for young adults with disabilities , while earning an income .
as populations grow and age , the care sector will only increase in importance .
adapting to these new circumstances now will give countries a considerable advantage , as it bolsters women &apos;s rights and freedoms , generates jobs , and make societies more equal .
so what are we waiting for ?
worker Protests In China : plentiful But preempted
the last annualized figure for labor protests that Beijing was willing to announce publicly was 100,000 for the year 1999 .
but a 2001 internal report from the Ministry of Public Security disclosed that the numbers &quot; began a rise like a violent wind &quot; from 1997 , the year of the Communist Party &apos;s fifteenth Congress , which pressed for factory firings in the name of &quot; efficiency . &quot;
while the government is determined to keep news of all disturbances out of the media--or at least downplay their size and disruptiveness--it has been possible to collect information on nearly 200 separate events occurring between 1994 and 2004 , some from news sources in Hong Kong , some from the Western media , and a few from Chinese publications .
they all exhibit the same , unchanging pattern : the government , whether in Beijing or the localities , tolerates the low @-@ decibel , smaller @-@ scale , relatively non @-@ disruptive marches and sit @-@ ins by demonstrators bearing petitions and posters , especially if they appear to be spontaneous , un @-@ organized , localized and leaderless .
the incidents loom substantially more dangerous to the political elite if they seem to have been mobilized by dissidents , are marked by some measure of violence , threaten to spread , or entail the obstruction of major transport trunklines .
indeed , the episodes that make it into the media beyond the Mainland are usually such protests .
what is sparking so much unrest in a country usually depicted as daily growing more affluent ?
generally the causes are these : unpaid wages and pensions ; sudden and massive job terminations ; and management corruption held responsible for the bankruptcy of industrial enterprises--where discharged workers were secure , enjoying privileges and benefits , since the 1950s .
job losses in the range of 60 million have suddenly rendered nearly an eighth of the urban populace indigent . often without a dependable channel for airing their grievances , hordes of laid @-@ off workers and retired folk have filled the avenues over the past decade or so .
doesn &apos;t the government mind if so much of its urban populace is sinking into poverty and becoming disaffected ? why is this stability @-@ obsessed regime allowing so much instability ?
in fact , the leaders are terribly uneasy about the situation and discuss it frequently . some of the response has been coldly coercive .
but there is also a compensatory effort that has absorbed much of the energy of the bureaucracies for labor and social security , and for civil affairs .
for 2004 , the central government allocated some 78 billion yuan for laid @-@ off workers and the poor , with localities also upping their outlays . but the sad truth is that probably only about a quarter of those pushed out of their plants ever received assistance .
for those who have , however , this policy has nipped discontent in the bud .
additionally , there have been attempts to create new posts , develop labor @-@ intensive industries and small and medium sized firms , promote the private sector , and encourage service jobs , plus offering occupational training : the government allocated an additional 4.7 billion yuan expressly for job creation in 2004 .
these policies mitigate the pain of job loss for their recipients .
promotion of the law also aims at alleviating anger . as workers &apos; consciousness of their rights increases , they are gradually more and more apt to appeal grievances to the courts : from 1995 to 2001 , adjudicated labor disputes rose from 28,000 to 101,000 .
offering workers legal redress has turned their attention temporarily from the streets to mediation and may well have reduced the number of street demonstrations .
other initiatives are a program of allowances , training and placement for the laid @-@ off ; unemployment insurance ( which , unfortunately , depends on the economic health of the firm to which a worker was once attached ) ; and pension reform--having similar problems .
there is also a scheme to supply a &quot; minimum livelihood guarantee &quot; to the desperately poor .
recipients numbered over 20 million as of early 2004 , when 15 billion yuan was budgeted for the program ( with the central government contributing a full 60 % ) . these programs are noticed at the grassroots , with the indigent feeling grateful for them .
protest in China has spun upward dramatically in recent years , in numbers , scale , and organization .
but by the means listed above the regime has become adept at suppressing opposition .
its power to intimidate and punish may trump all its other moves to stay ahead of the discontent .
but overall , increasing responsiveness--if clearly not in a democratic mode--has managed to maintain the instability that does exist at a level and within a scope that marks a game of unwritten rules -- one of complainants confining their choler within understood bounds and of the government watchful over an ever @-@ simmering stew .
workers &quot; Paradise ?
Cambridge -- Will the political resurgence of labor unions throw a wrench into the wheels of globalization ?
or will their growing strength serve to make globalization more sustainable by fostering great equality and fairness ?
one way or the other , unions stand as a major wild card for the evolution of our economic system in 2008 and beyond .
unions &quot; rising influence is evident in many recent events : German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s controversial deal to raise minimum wages for postal employees ; several American presidential candidates &quot; open misgivings about trade and immigration ; and the Chinese leadership &apos;s nascent concerns about labor standards .
along with their political clout , unions &quot; intellectual respectability is also experiencing a renaissance .
after decades of vilification by economists for raising unemployment and strangling growth , the union movement is now receiving backing from thought leaders such as Paul Krugman , who argues that stronger unions are needed to counter globalization &apos;s worst excesses .
the sudden emergence of unions as a political force is particularly surprising in the United States , where private @-@ sector union membership has fallen from 25 % in 1975 to 8 % today .
from high @-@ tech Google to mass retailer Wal @-@ Mart , US companies have found ways to keep their shops union @-@ free .
only the public sector , where the membership rate is 35 % , has remained a union bastion .
one of my best friends from childhood married a union organizer who found it so difficult to land a job in the US that he eventually moved his family to strike @-@ happy Canada .
today , US political leaders such as Congressman Barney Frank want to bring back unions .
but there is good reason to be skeptical .
for a relatively poor country like China , real unions could help balance employers &quot; power , bringing quality @-@ of @-@ life benefits that outweigh the growth costs .
factory conditions in parts of China are all too reminiscent of the early twentieth @-@ century , pre @-@ union US .
thousands of Chinese workers die each year in coal mines that sometimes lack basic safety precautions .
but , for the US and rich countries in Europe , the argument that stronger unions would bring more benefits than costs is far more dubious .
nowadays , most workers already have legal and statutory rights that cover the basic protections that unions originally fought for a century ago .
instead , union influence today all too often serves to promulgate inflexible work practices and flat salary structures that do not adequately reward work effort and skill .
it is no surprise that the public sector , where productivity is low and fiscal constraints soft , typically has the greatest union concentration .
teachers &quot; unions , especially , are a catastrophe , blocking any rationalization or improvement of many countries &quot; education systems .
before the modern globalization era , unions could thrive by organizing on a national scale , giving them enormous bargaining power vis @-@ à @-@ vis both employers and consumers .
now , after the explosive post @-@ war expansion of global trade , most unions have seen their monopoly power eroded , if not shattered .
that is why unions throughout much of the developed world have been fighting so hard to block free @-@ trade negotiations that might erode their position further .
some of the issues that unions are promoting , such as human rights and environmental quality , are unassailable .
when they try to connect these issues with trade , however , their motives become questionable .
a case in point is union lobbying against the US @-@ Colombia free @-@ trade agreement , ratification of which would greatly advance US @-@ Latin American relations .
legitimate questions about how the Colombian government conducted its epic civil war with drug @-@ financed rebels do not trump broader issues .
so anti @-@ pact activists have complained that Colombia is anti @-@ union because it does not protect union members from rebel violence .
yet the Colombian government notes that all Colombians suffer from rebel violence - union members actually experience less of it than the rest of the population .
unfortunately , this play is being re @-@ enacted across a host of trade issues , including many involving China .
for rich countries , income redistribution is much better handled through taxes and benefits system , rather than by government edicts to strengthen unions .
the rich today pay so little in taxes in many countries , that it would be a big improvement simply to move to a flat tax , with a very high exemption level so that lower @-@ income families pay nothing .
for middle @-@ income countries , it is a tougher call .
but here , too , increasing workers &quot; legal and statutory rights , while allowing most unions to fade away , seems like the right approach .
unfortunately , we are far more likely to see unions &quot; growing political influence become a major destabilizing force in trade and growth , with highly uncertain consequences .
when we see political leaders in many rich countries pander to unions by bashing each other on free trade and immigration , there is every reason to worry about trouble ahead .
that is why unions will be one of the main economic wild cards in 2008 .
the Evolution of Work
Cambridge - In mid @-@ December , the United Nations will launch the latest of its annual landmark Human Development Reports .
this year &apos;s report focuses on the nature of work : how the way we earn a living is being transformed by economic globalization , new technologies , and innovations in social organization .
the outlook for developing countries , in particular , is decidedly mixed .
for most people most of the time , work is mostly unpleasant .
historically , doing lots of backbreaking work is how countries have become rich .
and being rich is how some people get the chance to do more pleasant work .
thanks to the Industrial Revolution , new technologies in cotton textiles , iron and steel , and transportation delivered steadily rising levels of labor productivity for the first time in history .
first in Britain in the mid @-@ eighteenth century , and then in Western Europe and North America , men and women flocked from the countryside to towns to satisfy factories &quot; growing demand for labor .
but , for decades , workers gained few of the benefits of rising productivity .
they worked long hours in stifling conditions , lived in overcrowded and unsanitary housing , and experienced little growth in earnings .
some indicators , such as workers &quot; average height , suggest that standards of living may have even declined for a while .
eventually , capitalism transformed itself and its gains began to be shared more widely .
this was partly because wages naturally began to rise as the surplus of rural workers dried up .
but , equally important , workers organized themselves to defend their interests .
fearing revolution , the industrialists compromised .
civil and political rights were extended to the working class .
democracy , in turn , tamed capitalism further .
employment conditions improved as state @-@ mandated or negotiated arrangements led to reduced working hours , greater safety , and family , health , and other benefits .
public investment in education and training made workers both more productive and freer to exercise choice .
as a result , labor &apos;s share of the enterprise surplus rose .
while factory jobs never became pleasant , blue @-@ collar occupations now enabled a middle @-@ class standard of living , with all its consumption possibilities and lifestyle opportunities .
eventually , technological progress undermined industrial capitalism .
labor productivity in manufacturing industries rose much faster than in the rest of the economy : the same or higher quantity of steel , cars , and electronics could be produced with far fewer workers .
so the &quot; excess &quot; workers moved to service industries - education , health , finance , entertainment , and public administration , for example .
thus was born the post @-@ industrial economy .
work became more pleasant for some , but not for all .
for those with the skills , capital , and savvy to prosper in the post @-@ industrial age , services offered inordinate opportunities .
bankers , consultants , and engineers earned much higher wages than their industrial @-@ age forebears .
equally important , office work allowed a degree of freedom and personal autonomy that factory work never provided .
notwithstanding long hours ( perhaps longer than in factory jobs ) , service professionals enjoyed much greater control over their daily lives and workplace decisions .
teachers , nurses , and waiters were not paid nearly as well , but they , too , were released from the humdrum mechanical drudgery of the shop floor .
for less skilled workers , however , service @-@ sector jobs meant giving up the negotiated benefits of industrial capitalism .
the transition to a service economy often went hand in hand with the decline of unions , employment protections , and norms of pay equity , greatly weakening workers &quot; bargaining power and job security .
so the post @-@ industrial economy opened up a new chasm in the labor market , between those with stable , high @-@ paid , and fulfilling services jobs and those with fleeting , low @-@ paid , and unsatisfying jobs .
two factors determined the share of each type of job - and thus the extent of inequality produced by the post @-@ industrial transition : the education and skill level of the workforce , and the degree of institutionalization of labor markets in services ( in addition to manufacturing ) .
inequality , exclusion , and duality became more marked in countries where skills were poorly distributed and many services approximated the textbook &quot; ideal &quot; of spot markets .
the United States , where many workers are forced to hold multiple jobs in order to make an adequate living , remains the canonical example of this model .
the vast majority of workers still live in low- and middle @-@ income countries and have yet to go through these transformations .
there are two reasons to believe that their future path will ( or need ) not unfold in quite the same way .
first , there is no reason that safe working conditions , freedom of association , and collective bargaining cannot be introduced at earlier stages of development than has occurred historically .
just as political democracy need not wait for incomes to rise , strong labor standards need not lag behind economic development .
workers in low @-@ income countries should not be deprived of fundamental rights for the sake of industrial development and export performance .
second , the forces of globalization and technological progress have combined to alter the nature of manufacturing work in a way that makes it very difficult , if not impossible , for newcomers to emulate the industrialization experience of the Four Asian Tigers , or the European and North American economies before them .
many ( if not most ) developing countries are becoming service economies without having developed a large manufacturing sector - a process I have called &quot; premature de @-@ industrialization . &quot;
could premature de @-@ industrialization be a blessing in disguise , enabling workers in the developing world to bypass the drudgery of manufacturing ?
if so , how such a future could be constructed is not at all clear .
a society in which most workers are self @-@ proprietors - shopkeepers , independent professionals , or artists - and set their own terms of employment while making an adequate living is feasible only when economy @-@ wide productivity is already very high .
high @-@ productivity services - such as IT or finance - require well @-@ trained workers , not the unskilled kind that poor countries have in abundance .
so there is both good and bad news for the future of work in developing countries .
thanks to social policy and labor rights , workers can become full stakeholders in the economy much earlier in the process of development .
at the same time , the traditional engine of economic development - industrialization - is likely to operate at much lower capacity .
the resulting combination of high public expectations and low income @-@ producing capacity will be a major challenge for developing economies everywhere .
the Unfinished Business of Gender Parity
Davos - When it comes to the importance of gender equality in the workplace , the message has clearly gotten through to those at the top .
surveys - including those conducted by my own organization - consistently show that business leaders understand the need for equal treatment of men and women in the workforce .
indeed , my own conversations with senior businesspeople around the world confirm that progress clearly is being made .
the vast majority recognize the issue as imperative to their companies &quot; success and have implemented measures to promote gender parity in their organizations .
and yet , for all the fine words , much more remains to be done before gender parity is actually achieved .
the facts speak for themselves .
there is still a pay gap in every country in the world , with men earning more than women for similar jobs .
likewise , the percentage of seats on corporate boards occupied by women appears to have stalled at just over 17 % .
this bias has not gone unnoticed - especially among female employees .
in a 2015 PwC global survey of female millennials born between 1980 and 1995 , half of those working in financial services said they believed that men received more favorable treatment when it came to promotions .
more than 70 % said that as much as their organizations talk about diversity , in reality , opportunities remain unequal .
interestingly , other studies conclude that when women are provided with the opportunity to perform on an equal footing with men , they more often than not come out on top .
a recent ten @-@ year analysis of 300 start @-@ up investments backed by venture capitalists in the United States showed that companies with a female founder performed 63 % better than those with all @-@ male founding teams .
and another of PwC &apos;s research programs , examining the changing faces of billionaires worldwide , discovered what we called the &quot; Athena Factor . &quot;
the increase in the number of female billionaires significantly outpaces that among men , with Asia registering the fastest growth in the ranks of self @-@ made female billionaires .
where women have the opportunity to capitalize on their talents , they are doing so successfully and with gusto .
meanwhile , there is growing recognition of the positive contribution that greater workforce diversity makes to business performance .
and yet , as reflected in the stubborn persistence of the pay gap , barriers to women &apos;s progress remain .
what is now needed is a genuine and permanent shift in attitudes and behavior .
many of the biases holding women back are unconscious ; and , by their very nature , these blind spots cannot be tackled by statements of intent alone .
tackling gender inequality will require us to identify where , how , and why these biases materialize , and to develop systematic strategies and interventions to root them out .
in order to accomplish this , businesses must actively challenge men to help advance women in the workforce .
that is why I am proud to be a founding Corporate Impact Champion of the UN Women &apos;s HeForShe movement .
creating real and lasting change will require helping men and women work together .
the business case for doing so is incontrovertible .
not only do women make up half the global population ; the same skills needed to work through differences in gender - open @-@ mindedness , humility , empathy - can be used to work across other types of differences , be they cultural , physical , or personal .
it is important , of course , to reassure male skeptics who view gender parity as a threat .
in June 2015 , I hosted a HeForShe chat on Twitter , and while the conversation was overwhelmingly positive , an obvious concern surfaced : why should men help promote women to positions for which they themselves are aiming ?
addressing such concerns will require us to show that we are not promoting some people at the expense of others ; gender parity must be win @-@ win , not zero @-@ sum .
at PwC , this is being addressed by hosting conversations in which men and women discuss gender issues collaboratively and respectfully , and by working with both genders to challenge double standards and acknowledge potential blind spots .
recent research suggests that , at the current rate of progress , it will take another 80 years to reach gender parity .
that is not good enough .
let us all commit to achieving it in our lifetimes - for the benefit of everyone .
four Ways to Beat HIV / AIDS
Pittsburgh - In the fight against HIV / AIDS , some stories illuminate the long road to global eradication more than others .
in 2009 , I heard one such story in Tanzania .
I was visiting a remote village when I spoke to a woman who knew that she was HIV @-@ positive .
she told me that the established health guidelines at the time indicated that she could not receive treatment until her count of CD4 T @-@ helper cells , a type of white blood cell used by the immune system , had dropped below a certain threshold .
after walking several miles to get her count checked , she arrived at the clinic only to find its testing machine broken .
the machine was still inoperative the second time she made the long journey .
only months later , after her third trip to the clinic on foot , did she receive her cell count : her levels were far below the necessary threshold .
her treatment should have begun months before .
since HIV / AIDS was first identified in 1984 , it has killed more than 35 million people .
although the number of AIDS @-@ related deaths has fallen by almost half since peaking in 2005 , there are still far too many people dying from this preventable condition .
in 2016 alone , one million people around the world died from HIV @-@ related causes , while 1.8 million more became infected .
contrary to popular myth , we have not turned the corner on AIDS - not by a long shot .
world AIDS Day , on December 1 , is an occasion to honor the millions of victims , and to recommit to ending this devastating disease .
according to UNAIDS , just 54 % of HIV @-@ positive adults , and only 43 % of HIV @-@ positive children , are currently receiving the antiretroviral therapies that save lives and prevent new infections .
with so many untreated patients , the virus will continue to spread .
as CEO of a global pharmaceutical company , I &apos;m proud of the work we have done to fight HIV / AIDS around the world .
today , more than eight million people - nearly half of all patients receiving treatment for HIV in developing countries - depend on the antiretroviral treatments that we produce .
but for those of us on the front lines of this struggle , our work is far from over .
the pharmaceutical industry has a responsibility to expand access to testing and treatment , and to help stop the spread of HIV once and for all .
fulfilling four key commitments will make this goal achievable .
for starters , pharmaceutical companies should do more to increase the availability of low @-@ cost , generic medicines .
my company , Mylan , introduced the first generic once @-@ daily pill for developing countries in 2009 , and we have continually reduced its price to make it more accessible to more people .
with this treatment alone , Mylan and other generic manufacturers save the US government , international donors , and national health programs more than $ 4.5 billion a year .
still , treatment options could be expanded further .
in September , Mylan announced a collaboration with UNAIDS , the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , the Clinton Health Access Initiative , and other partners to provide the next @-@ generation single @-@ pill HIV regimen to patients in more than 90 low- and middle @-@ income countries for less than $ 75 per year .
these drugs are widely used in high @-@ income countries because they produce fewer side effects .
affordability initiatives like this one should be replicated .
next , drug makers must continue investing in capacity and supply @-@ chain reliability .
since 2005 , the number of people on antiretroviral therapies worldwide has grown by a factor of ten , to 21 million .
but roughly twice as many people are currently infected with HIV .
over the last decade , Mylan has invested more than $ 250 million in expanding production capacity , and we now produce four billion tablets and capsules each year .
but further investments are needed if we are to provide access to the other 21 million people still not on treatment .
a third urgently needed commitment is to increase support for research that accelerates the development of new innovations in effective and efficient treatment delivery .
for example , Mylan provides study medications to research trials , like the MaxART trial in Swaziland , which demonstrated that providing treatment to all HIV @-@ positive people is the best way to slow the disease &apos;s spread .
we also supported the Kirby Institute &apos;s ENCORE1 trial , to develop a reduced @-@ dose version of the most commonly used HIV treatment regimen .
and we are currently working with the US Agency for International Development as part of a partnership called optimize , which aims to accelerate access to new therapies .
we do not support trials like these because we hope to gain any marketable intellectual property - we won &apos;t .
rather , we support them because it is the right way to advance science and improve treatment .
finally , real gains in the fight against HIV / AIDS will require drug makers to account for the limitations of health @-@ care systems and distribution networks in the developing countries they serve .
antiretroviral therapies for children are a good example of these challenges .
drugs for young people produced in the West are often liquids that require refrigeration .
but developing countries often have limited cold @-@ storage capacities or an inability to transport liquid in bulk .
that &apos;s why Mylan has developed heat @-@ stable , taste @-@ masked , dispersible tablets that can easily be incorporated into food .
our scientists are now working on the next @-@ generation formula , which comes in the equivalent of a sugar packet that even newborns can take .
more innovations like these will be needed to solve the country @-@ specific issues that patients face .
the global health community has made remarkable progress in turning the tide on HIV / AIDS , introducing new products and advocating for earlier treatment .
but when I think back to the woman I met in Tanzania , I am reminded of how much work remains to be done .
makers of generic medicines have an important role to play in this fight , and we will not stop working until treatment is available to every patient in the world who needs it .
the World Bank Needs to Return to Its Mission
new YORK - The World Bank declares that its mission is to end extreme poverty within a generation and to boost shared prosperity .
these goals are universally agreed as part of the Sustainable Development Goals .
but the World Bank lacks an SDG strategy , and now it is turning to Wall Street to please its political masters in Washington .
the Bank &apos;s president , Jim Yong Kim , should find a better way forward , and he can do so by revisiting one of his own great successes .
Kim and I worked closely together from 2000 to 2005 , to scale up the world &apos;s response to the AIDS epidemic .
partners in Health , the NGO led by Kim and his colleague , Harvard University &apos;s Paul Farmer , had used antiretroviral medicines ( ARVs ) to treat around 1,000 impoverished HIV @-@ infected rural residents in Haiti , and had restored them to health and hope .
I pointed out to Kim and Farmer 18 years ago that their success in Haiti could be expanded to reach millions of people at low cost and with very high social benefits .
I recommended a new multilateral funding mechanism , a global fund , to fight AIDS , and a new funding effort by the United States .
in early 2001 , UN Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan launched the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria , and in 2003 US President George W. Bush launched the PEPFAR program .
the World Health Organization , led by the Director @-@ General Gro Harlem Brundtland , recruited Kim to lead the WHO &apos;s scale @-@ up effort .
Kim did a fantastic job , and his efforts provided the groundwork for bringing ARVs to millions , saving lives , livelihoods , and families .
there are four lessons of that great success .
first , the private sector was an important partner , by offering patent @-@ protected drugs at production cost .
drug companies eschewed profits in the poorest countries out of decency and for the sake of their reputations .
they recognized that patent rights , if exercised to excess , would be a death warrant for millions of poor people .
second , the effort was supported by private philanthropy , led by Bill Gates , who inspired others to contribute as well .
the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation backed the new Global Fund , the WHO , and the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health , which I led for the WHO in 2000 @-@ 2001 ( and which successfully campaigned for increased donor funding to fight AIDS and other killer diseases ) .
third , the funding to fight AIDS took the form of outright grants , not Wall Street loans .
fighting AIDS in poor countries was not viewed as a revenue @-@ generating investment needing fancy financial engineering .
it was regarded as a vital public good that required philanthropists and high @-@ income countries to fund life @-@ saving treatment for poor and dying people .
fourth , trained public health specialists led the entire effort , with Kim and Farmer serving as models of professionalism and rectitude .
the Global Fund does not stuff the pockets of corrupt ministers , or trade funding for oil concessions or arms deals .
the Global Fund applies rigorous , technical standards of public health , and holds recipient countries accountable - including through transparency and co @-@ financing requirements - for delivering services .
the World Bank needs to return to its mission .
the SDGs call for , among other things , ending extreme poverty and hunger , instituting universal health coverage , and universal primary and upper secondary education by 2030 .
but , despite making only slow progress toward these goals , the Bank shows no alarm or strategy to help get the SDGs on track for 2030 .
on the contrary , rather than embrace the SDGs , the Bank is practically mute , and its officials have even been heard to mutter negatively about them in the corridors of power .
perhaps US President Donald Trump doesn &apos;t want to hear about his government &apos;s responsibilities vis @-@ à @-@ vis the SDGs .
but it is Kim &apos;s job to remind him and the US Congress of those obligations - and that it was a Republican president , George W. Bush who creatively and successfully pursued the battle against AIDS .
Wall Street may help to structure the financing of large @-@ scale renewable energy projects , public transport , highways , and other infrastructure that can pay its way with tolls and user fees .
a World Bank @-@ Wall Street partnership could help to ensure that such projects are environmentally sound and fair to the affected communities .
that would be all for the good .
yet such projects , designed for profit or at least direct cost recovery , are not even remotely sufficient to end extreme poverty .
poor countries need grants , not loans , for basic needs like health and education .
Kim should draw on his experience as the global health champion who successfully battled against AIDS , rather than embracing an approach that would only bury poor countries in debt .
we need the World Bank &apos;s voice and strenuous efforts to mobilize grant financing for the SDGs .
health care for the poor requires systematic training and deployment of community health workers , diagnostics , medicines , and information systems .
education for the poor requires trained teachers , safe and modern classrooms , and connectivity to other schools and to online curricula .
these SDGs can be achieved , but only if there is a clear strategy , grant financing , and clear delivery mechanisms .
the World Bank should develop the expertise to help donors and recipient governments make these programs work .
Kim knows just how to do this , from his own experience .
Trump and other world leaders are personally accountable for the SDGs .
they need to do vastly more .
so , too , do the world &apos;s super @-@ rich , whose degree of wealth is historically unprecedented .
the super @-@ rich have received round after round of tax cuts and special tax breaks , easy credits from central banks , and exceptional gains from technologies that are boosting profits while lowering unskilled workers &quot; wages .
even with stock markets &quot; recent softness , the world &apos;s 2000 + billionaires have around $ 10 trillion in wealth - enough to fund fully the incremental effort needed to end extreme poverty , if the governments also do their part .
when going to Wall Street , or Davos , or other centers of wealth , the World Bank should inspire the billionaires to put their surging wealth into personal philanthropy to support the SDGs .
bill Gates is doing this , with historic results , for public health .
which billionaires will champion the SDGs for education , renewable energy , fresh water and sanitation , and sustainable agriculture ?
with a clear SDG plan , the World Bank would find partners to help it fulfill its core , historic , and vital mission .
the ABCs of Doing Business
new YORK - The World Bank &apos;s annual Doing Business ( DB ) report is probably its most @-@ cited publication .
it is also the Bank &apos;s most contentious , and with the release of Doing Business 2018 last October , the controversy surrounding the report has reached new heights , with some critics accusing it of obfuscation , data rigging , and political manipulation .
I was closely involved with the DB report from 2012 to 2016 , so I had to restrain myself from jumping into the debate on the topic .
but now , a review of the DB index and annual report seems worthwhile .
I first became familiar with the DB report when I was an adviser to the Indian government and would look to it for ideas about how to cut India &apos;s notoriously cumbersome bureaucratic red tape .
so , when I moved to the World Bank and learned that I would be overseeing the DB team , it was like a regular restaurant patron suddenly being asked to supervise the kitchen .
the upshot was that I learned all that went on behind the scenes .
and although I had some conceptual disagreements , I was impressed by the integrity of the process .
the DB index aims to measure , across countries , the ease of starting a business , obtaining the relevant permits , accessing essential infrastructure , and so forth .
it comprises ten indicators , each of which is based on various sub @-@ indicators , and all of which are aggregated , according to a fixed rule , into a final score that determines a country &apos;s ranking among 190 economies .
according to the 2018 report , New Zealand and Singapore are the world &apos;s best and second @-@ best places to do business , and Eritrea and Somalia are the worst , at 189 and 190 , respectively .
although there were aspects of the DB rankings that I did not like , I do not find the recent charges of data rigging to be credible .
having personally supervised much of the process , which involves a very large team compiling economic data from around the world , I can vouch for the multiple layers of checks and balances that are in place .
nevertheless , there certainly are ways to influence the rankings without cooking up data .
with any big operation - whether it is the DB or an effort to measure GDP - one occasionally discovers conceptual flaws .
for example , when I first took over the process , I disagreed with the prevailing assumption that a higher tax rate is necessarily worse for an economy .
after all , the same logic dictates that the lower the tax rate , the better , which implies that a tax rate of zero is optimal .
but that is obviously absurd .
even if one ignores the moral dimensions , a very low tax rate leaves a country more exposed to the threat of severe fiscal crises , which are a nightmare for business .
steps were taken to make some minimal corrections that would not be too disruptive .
still , recognizing such problems poses a dilemma .
it is never ideal to have to change a yardstick that has been used to track changes over time ; but nor is it right to rely on an assumption that one knows to be flawed .
at the end of the day , it &apos;s a judgment call .
for my part , I mitigated against possible biases by not even looking at the final result until I had first decided , using abstract reasoning , which changes were essential .
in this year &apos;s DB , the two big controversies concern India &apos;s rise and Chile &apos;s fall .
between 2016 and 2017 , India moved from 130th to 100th place .
I no longer have inside information on the data , but I can see two reasons why this could occur .
first , if a country is determined to move up the ranking , it can do so by focusing on the ten indicators that determine the final score , though this is not a national economic strategy that I would recommend .
second , any change in ranking can be driven either by what a country does relative to other countries , or by measurement changes that the DB may have instituted in a given year - changes like those mentioned above .
for example , when India moved from 142nd to 130th place between 2014 and 2015 , the DB team and I computed that only four of the 12 positions that India had climbed reflected changes India had made , with the remainder attributable to changes in the DB methodology .
as for Chile , which slipped from 48th to 57th place between 2015 and 2016 , and is now ranked 55th , it is worth noting that there is a lot of cheek @-@ by @-@ jowl competition at the higher end of the ranking .
small changes by countries that neighbor one another in the index can result in a sharp reordering .
but it is also true that Chilean President Michelle Bachelet &apos;s government has placed greater emphasis on social indicators than on economic indicators .
to my mind , that is a cause for praise , not criticism .
having worked with Bachelet on the World Bank &apos;s 2018 World Development Report on education , I know that she is that rare politician who is genuinely committed to improving social welfare .
many countries and political leaders make the mistake of equating the DB ranking with overall welfare .
but the DB merely measures what it says it measures : the ease of doing business .
that is certainly important for an economy , but it isn &apos;t everything .
in fact , one of the first lessons of economics is that all good things in life involve tradeoffs .
it would be a pity to see more countries focusing only on &quot; doing business &quot; to the exclusion of other indicators of wellbeing .
the Risk of a New Economic Non @-@ Order
London - Next month , when finance ministers and central bank governors from more than 180 countries gather in Washington , DC , for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank , they will confront a global economic order under increasing strain .
having failed to deliver the inclusive economic prosperity of which it is capable , that order is subject to growing doubts - and mounting challenges .
barring a course correction , the risks that today &apos;s order will yield to a world economic non @-@ order will only intensify .
the current international economic order , spearheaded by the United States and its allies in the wake of World War II , is underpinned by multilateral institutions , including the IMF and the World Bank .
these institutions were designed to crystallize member countries &quot; obligations , and they embodied a set of best economic @-@ policy practices that evolved into what became known as the &quot; Washington Consensus . &quot;
that consensus was rooted in an economic paradigm that aimed to promote win @-@ win interactions among countries , emphasizing trade liberalization , relatively unrestricted cross @-@ border capital flows , free @-@ market pricing , and domestic deregulation .
all of this stood in stark contrast to what developed behind the Iron Curtain and in China over the first half of the postwar period .
for several decades , the Western @-@ led international order functioned well , helping to deliver prosperity and relative financial stability .
then it was shaken by a series of financial shocks that culminated in the 2008 global financial crisis , which triggered cascading economic failures that pushed the world to the edge of a devastating multi @-@ year depression .
it was the most severe economic breakdown since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
but the crisis did not appear out of nowhere to challenge a healthy economic order .
on the contrary , the evolution of the global order had long been outpaced by structural economic changes on the ground , with multilateral governance institutions taking too long to recognize fully the significance of financial @-@ sector developments and their impact on the real economy , or to make adequate room for emerging economies .
for example , governance structures , including voting power , correspond better to the economic realities of yesterday than to those of today and tomorrow .
and nationality , rather than merit , still is the dominant guide for the appointment of these institutions &quot; leaders , with top positions still reserved for European and US citizens .
the destabilizing consequences of this obstinate failure to reform sufficiently multilateral governance have been compounded by China &apos;s own struggle to reconcile its domestic priorities with its global economic responsibilities as the world &apos;s second @-@ largest economy .
several other countries , particularly among the advanced economies , have also failed to transform their domestic policies to account for changes to economic relationships resulting from globalization , liberalization , and deregulation .
as a result of all of this , the balance of winners and losers has become increasingly extreme and more difficult to manage , not just economically , but also politically and socially .
with too many people feeling marginalized , forgotten , and dispossessed - and angry at the leaders and institutions that have allowed this to happen - domestic policy pressure has intensified , causing countries to turn inward .
this tendency is reflected in recent challenges to several features of the economic order , such as the North American Free @-@ Trade Agreement , as well as America &apos;s withdrawal from the Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership and the United Kingdom &apos;s renunciation of European Union membership .
all are casting a shadow on the future of the global economic system .
America &apos;s inward turn , already underway for several years , has been particularly consequential , because it leaves the world order without a main conductor .
with no other country or group of countries anywhere close to being in a position to carry the baton , the emergence of what the political scientist Ian Bremmer has called a &quot; G @-@ Zero era &quot; becomes a lot more probable .
China is responding to the global system &apos;s weakening core by accelerating its efforts to build small networks , including around the traditional Western @-@ dominated power structures .
this has included the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , the proliferation of bilateral payments agreements , and the pursuit of the &quot; Belt and Road Initiative &quot; to build infrastructure linking China with western Asia , Europe , and Africa .
these dynamics are stoking trade tensions and raising the risk of economic fragmentation .
if this trend continues , the global economic and financial configuration will become increasingly unstable , amplifying geopolitical and security threats at a time when better cross @-@ border coordination is vital to address threats from non @-@ state actors and disruptive regimes , such as North Korea .
over time , the risks associated with this shift toward a global economic non @-@ order could have severe adverse effects on geopolitics and national security .
none of this is new .
yet , year after year , top government officials at the IMF / World Bank annual meetings fail to address it .
this year is likely to be no different .
instead of discussing concrete steps to slow and reverse the march toward a global economic non @-@ order , officials will probably welcome the cyclical uptick in global growth and urge member countries to do more to remove structural impediments to faster , more durable , and more inclusive growth .
while understandable , that isn &apos;t good enough .
the upcoming meetings offer a critical opportunity to start a serious discussion of how to arrest the lose @-@ lose dynamics that have been gaining traction in the global economy .
the longer it takes for the seeds of reform to be sown , the less likely they will be to take root - and the higher the probability that a lose @-@ lose world economic non @-@ order will emerge .
poverty Beyond the Numbers
ASUNCIÓN - What is poverty ?
for decades , we have defined it with a number , which the World Bank currently puts at a personal income of less than $ 1.90 per day .
but a single number fails to capture the complexity of poverty .
measuring more than just income is essential to understanding the needs of poor people and delivering optimal assistance .
as the World Bank convenes its Spring Meetings in Washington , DC next week , we have an opportunity to set benchmarks that include social and environmental dimensions of poverty .
the Bank has acknowledged that more than income should be considered , and recently established a Commission on Global Poverty to recommend additional metrics .
although many public and private groups already collect data on a range of issues affecting poor communities such as nutrition , maternal health , or access to education , such information remains largely untapped and is rarely shared across institutions .
but there are some beacons of light , including the Social Progress Index , which provides a framework for tracking multiple symptoms of poverty across countries and complements traditional income @-@ based measures .
when we rely on a single number to measure poverty , we misdiagnose the needs of poor people .
in my home country , Paraguay , I work with one of the country &apos;s largest social enterprises , Fundación Paraguaya , to provide microfinance , education , and training to thousands of our poorest citizens .
we look at 50 metrics across six dimensions of poverty , including income , housing , education , and infrastructure .
one of our clients , Doña Mercedes , is now a successful micro @-@ entrepreneur from a rural community not far from the capital city of Asunción .
when she first started with Fundación Paraguaya , she was sharing a single @-@ bedroom home with 16 other family members and cooking meals on a small fire pit on the dirt floor .
now she has a cement floor , a brick house , a separate kitchen , and around $ 500 in personal savings .
by using Fundación Paraguaya &apos;s self @-@ evaluation on poverty , she was able to understand her own needs better and address them one at time .
while traditional approaches focus largely on estimating the sources of household expenses and income , the Fundación Paraguaya self @-@ evaluation helped Doña Mercedes break down her needs into 50 discrete areas that she could work on , piece by piece , and monitor over time .
for example , she self @-@ evaluated the state of her bathroom and kitchen , the quality of the food eaten at home , the family &apos;s dental health , the number of separate bedrooms in the house , and even her self @-@ esteem and decision @-@ making capacity .
a simple poverty map helps her track her progress by using the colors of the stoplight , red , yellow , and green , and highlight her priority areas .
next she plans to add two more bedrooms to her house and to work on enlarging her business .
Fundación Paraguaya has been able to replicate this type of success in other parts of the world .
in Tanzania , where I worked for three years in rural communities , we helped villages in the Southern Highlands adapt our poverty indicators to the local context in order to tackle water , sanitation , and electrification needs .
similar efforts are being deployed in South Africa , Nigeria , Uganda , China , and beyond .
we could make even more progress with public @-@ sector support .
Fundación Paraguaya collects rich data across multiple dimensions , tracking more than 8,700 families each year in Paraguay alone .
if this information were to reach the government of Paraguay - which has its own methods for collecting data - we could identify pockets of poverty sooner and customize programs to help each family .
because the information is self @-@ reported , this sort of collaboration could deliver targeted aid and highlight specific public services that are needed .
moreover , if the World Bank &apos;s Commission on Global Poverty adopts multidimensional poverty measures , it will spur other organizations to produce and share more detailed poverty data .
that will give aid workers a more comprehensive poverty map of the world , helping to boost the effectiveness of anti @-@ poverty efforts everywhere .
it won &apos;t be easy to choose which measures to include , or even how to set universal yardsticks ; but even adopting a few basic ones would spur progress .
for too long , one @-@ dimensional measures such as the $ 1.90 per day guideline have misdiagnosed poor people &apos;s problems - and more importantly , their causes .
we know that the $ 1.90 per day benchmark does not fully capture the struggles of poor people in places such as Paraguay .
fortunately , the World Bank now appears to recognize the limits of its income @-@ based indicator .
ensuring that the right type of aid reaches those most in need in a timely and effective manner requires development policymakers to embrace the type of multidimensional poverty data that aid organizations like Fundación Paraguaya have learned to gather .
can the World Bank redeem Itself ?
Cambridge - In recent years , as the World Bank &apos;s financing role has been eclipsed by the rise of private capital and a surge in money from China , its leaders have been desperately seeking a new mission .
and interminable reorganizations , politicized appointments , and the changing priorities of successive presidents have contributed to the perception that the institution is less than functional .
but can that change ?
the World Bank has tried to reinvent itself as a supplier of global public goods and a &quot; knowledge bank &quot; that provides data , analysis , and research to its developing @-@ country clients .
and few would deny the Bank &apos;s achievements when it comes to gathering indicators of economic activity , measuring poverty , identifying deficiencies in the provision of health and education , and , in earlier years , designing and evaluating development projects .
but many , such as the Nobel laureate economist Angus Deaton , have criticized the World Bank &apos;s overall performance .
one problem is that development outcomes also depend on poor countries &quot; external economic environment , which is shaped by the policies of the major economies .
and when it comes to promoting sound policies , the World Bank has fallen far short in recent decades , exemplified by three major intellectual sins of omission .
the first relates to the World Bank &apos;s role in the Latin American debt crisis of the early 1980s .
as its official history shows , the Bank restricted research on the implications of excessive borrowing during the crisis .
moreover , it did little to make the case for debt write @-@ downs , despite the reckless increase in lending by big banks .
instead , through its structural @-@ adjustment lending , the World Bank , along with the International Monetary Fund , effectively became a debt collector for creditors .
the result was a lost decade for Latin America , but not for the bankers .
the resulting moral hazard would encourage another bout of exuberant lending , which led to further financial crises in developing countries in the subsequent decade .
the World Bank was also silent when its developing @-@ country clients &quot; access to life @-@ saving medications was being restricted .
in the late 1980s , the leading industrialized countries - the United States , Europe , and Japan - began to push for stronger patent regimes that would boost their own pharmaceutical companies &quot; profits .
in 1995 , developing countries were forced to sign the onerous Trade @-@ Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement at the World Trade Organization .
moreover , under Section 301 of the US Trade Act of 1974 , sanctions were imposed on several developing countries , from Chile to India , accused of failing to strengthen patent protections sufficiently .
even when the AIDS crisis was ravaging Sub @-@ Saharan Africa in the early 2000s , global patent rules were not just maintained , but actually tightened further , until pressure from civil society finally forced the expansion of access to affordable treatment .
the World Bank , however , said little .
this brings us to the World Bank &apos;s third failure , the consequences of which are unfolding today .
during much of the 1980s and 1990s , the Bank oversaw structural adjustment programs in developing countries that focused on deregulation , privatization , and economic liberalization , especially trade opening , all of which helped to enable globalization .
while there were undoubtedly problems with many aspects of such a one @-@ size @-@ fit @-@ all package of policies - the Washington Consensus , as it was known - the trade liberalization component helped accelerate lower @-@ middle @-@ income and middle @-@ income countries &quot; economic convergence with developed countries .
but , today , the United States is rejecting trade openness , imposing unilateral tariffs and other barriers , and renegotiating trade deals on worse terms .
and the World Bank &apos;s silence is deafening .
its senior leadership has said nothing about the serious threat posed by the actions of the US or of other major players .
while the Bank &apos;s annual report , released in September , talks of a commitment to &quot; researching today &apos;s most pressing topics , &quot; trade is not among them .
this is not just some oversight ; during all of these episodes , the Bank knew that its responsibility was to act as an advocate for its poor clients . instead , it decided - every time - to kowtow to its most powerful shareholders and their vested interests ( such as Big Pharma and the financial industry ) , arguably in exchange for additional resources for its soft @-@ loan window ( the International Development Association ) and , less frequently , capital increases for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( IBRD ) and International Finance Corporation .
for example , this April - after the US had launched its trade war with tariffs on steel and aluminum - the Development Committee of the World Bank Board of Governors endorsed a package that included a $ 7.5 billion paid @-@ in capital increase for the IBRD .
this required the support of President Donald Trump &apos;s administration , leading to silence from the Bank until June , when it finally warned of the negative impact of trade protectionism on global growth .
one might wonder whether such a Faustian bargain could be worthwhile if it means that the World Bank has more resources to promote development in poor countries .
but while money certainly matters , the evidence suggests that development outcomes are determined more by factors like state capacity and national policies , and crucially , a supportive global environment .
rising trade protectionism , tighter immigration policies , and a lack of action on climate change by the world &apos;s biggest economic players - particularly the US - thus pose serious threats to development , which a little extra money for the World Bank cannot offset .
the ends do not justify the means : money may not matter that much , while ideas matter immensely in the broader fight against poverty ( as this year &apos;s Nobel Economics laureate , Paul Romer , has shown ) .
the World Bank cannot erase its troubling history of silence .
but it may be able to redeem itself .
its new chief economist is an expert on trade . the Bank &apos;s leadership should empower her to lead the charge in making the intellectual case for open markets for goods , services , and people .
the World Bank is well aware that its mission - &quot; to reduce poverty , and improve living standards by promoting sustainable growth and investment in people &quot; - cannot be achieved without an open global system .
if it chooses not to uphold a core tenet of its mission , and instead continues to try ingratiating itself with its largest shareholders , it will not only fail its clients throughout the developing world ; it will also lose whatever is left of its raison d &quot; être .
the Sky Is Not Falling
Vienna - Humans are partial to bad news .
media outlets reflect and shape this preference , feeding us woe and panic .
long , slow , positive trends don &apos;t make it to the front page or to water @-@ cooler conversations .
so we develop peculiar misperceptions , especially the idea that a preponderance of things are going wrong .
when I published The Skeptical Environmentalist in 2001 , I pointed out that the world was getting better in many respects .
back then , this was viewed as heresy , as it punctured several common and cherished misperceptions , such as the idea that natural resources were running out , that an ever @-@ growing population was leaving less to eat , and that air and water were becoming ever @-@ more polluted .
in each case , careful examination of the data established that the gloomy scenarios prevailing at the time were exaggerated .
while fish stocks , for example , are depleted because of a lack of regulation , we can actually eat more fish than ever , thanks to the advent of aquaculture .
worries that we are losing forests overlook the reality that as countries become richer , they increase their forest cover .
since I wrote the book , the world has only become better , according to many important indicators .
we have continued to see meaningful reductions in infant mortality and malnutrition , and there have been massive strides toward eradication of polio , measles , malaria , and illiteracy .
by focusing on the most lethal environmental problem - air pollution - we can see some of the reasons for improvement .
as the world developed , deaths from air pollution have declined dramatically , and that trend is likely to continue .
looking at a polluted city in a country like China might suggest otherwise , but the air inside the homes of most poor people is about ten times more polluted than the worst outdoor air in Beijing .
the most serious environmental problem for humans is indoor air pollution from cooking and heating with dirty fuels like wood and dung - which is the result of poverty .
in 1900 , more than 90 % of all air pollution deaths resulted from indoor air pollution .
economic development has meant more outdoor pollution , but also much less indoor pollution .
reductions in poverty have gone hand in hand with a four @-@ fold reduction in global air pollution mortality .
yet more people today still die from indoor air pollution than from outdoor pollution .
even in China , while outside air has become a lot more polluted , poverty reduction has caused a lower risk of total air pollution death .
and as countries become richer , they can afford to regulate and cut even outdoor air pollution .
two hundred years ago , almost every person on the planet lived in poverty , and a tiny elite in luxury .
today just 9.1 % of the population , or almost 700 million people , lives on less than $ 1.90 per day ( or what used to be one dollar in 1985 ) .
and just in the last 20 years , the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has almost halved .
yet few of us know this .
the Gapminder foundation surveyed the UK and found that just 10 % of people believe poverty has decreased .
in South Africa and in Sweden , more people believe extreme poverty has doubled than believe - correctly - that it has plummeted .
how do we continue our swift progress ?
there has been no shortage of well @-@ intentioned policy interventions , so we have decades of data showing what works well and what doesn &apos;t .
in the latter category , even well @-@ considered ideas from the world &apos;s most eminent thinkers can fall short .
the ambitious Millennium Villages concept was supposed to create simultaneous progress on multiple fronts , producing &quot; major results in three or fewer years , &quot; according to founder Jeffrey D. Sachs .
but a study by the United Kingdom &apos;s Department for International Development shows the villages had &quot; moderately positive impacts , &quot; and &quot; little overall impact on poverty . &quot;
it &apos;s more constructive to focus on what works .
global analysis of development targets for Copenhagen Consensus by a panel of Nobel laureate economists showed where more money can achieve the most .
they concluded that improved access to contraception and family @-@ planning services would reduce maternal and child mortality , and also - through a demographic dividend - increase economic growth .
likewise , research assessing the best development policies for Haiti found that focusing on improvements in nutrition through the use of fortified flour would transform the health of young children , creating lifelong benefits .
other Copenhagen Consensus research suggests that scaling up government e @-@ procurement platforms would be transformative .
this may sound tangential to poverty reduction , but it &apos;s not .
on average , developing countries use half their budgets on procurement ; enabling transparent competition could reduce losses caused by corruption .
this is not mere speculation .
a case study in Bangladesh , which spends more than $ 9 billion on public procurement annually , found that piloting e @-@ procurement in just one government department lowered prices by 12 % , leaving more resources for other important budget priorities .
the research shows that expanding digital procurement government @-@ wide would save $ 670 million annually - enough to increase annual public @-@ health spending by about 50 % .
the Bangladeshi government is now fast @-@ tracking this expansion .
and the most powerful weapon in the fight against poverty is the one that got us where we are today : broad @-@ based economic growth .
over the past 30 years , China &apos;s growth spurt alone lifted an unprecedented 680 million people above the poverty line .
a global trade agreement - such as a successful conclusion to the stalled Doha Round - would lift another 160 million people out of poverty .
skepticism toward free trade hurts the world &apos;s poorest .
while other US policies and tweets by President Donald Trump get far more coverage , the current administration &apos;s rejection of free trade could be the biggest tragedy .
humanity &apos;s success in reducing poverty is an extraordinary achievement , and one that we are far too reticent about acknowledging .
we need to make sure that we don &apos;t lose sight of what got us this far - and what justifies the hope of an even better future .
the World Economy in 2018
Stanford - All major macroeconomic indicators - growth , unemployment , and inflation - suggest that 2017 will be the American economy &apos;s best year in a decade .
and the global economy is enjoying broad , synchronized growth beyond what anyone expected .
the question now is whether this strong performance will continue in 2018 .
the answer , of course , will depend on monetary , fiscal , trade , and related policies in the United States and around the world .
and yet it is hard to predict what policy proposals will emerge in 2018 .
there are relatively new heads of state in the US , France , and the United Kingdom ; German leaders still have not formed a governing coalition since the general election in September ; and the US Federal Reserve has a new chair awaiting confirmation .
moreover , major changes in important developing economies such as Argentina , Saudi Arabia , and Brazil have made the future outlook even murkier .
still , we should hope for the best .
first and foremost , we should hope that synchronized global growth at a rate of just under 4 % will continue in 2018 , as the International Monetary Fund projected in October .
growth not only raises incomes , but also makes vexing problems such as bad bank loans and budget deficits more manageable .
as former US President John F. Kennedy famously said in an October 1963 speech in which he promoted his proposed corporate and personal tax reductions , &quot; a rising tide lifts all boats . &quot;
for my part , I predict that the global recovery will continue , but at a slightly slower growth rate of around 3.5 % .
the two most obvious risks to keep an eye on will be Europe , where a cyclical upturn could stall , and the oil @-@ rich Middle East , where tensions could flare up once again .
second , let us hope that the Fed , guided by the steady hand of its new chair , Jerome &quot; Jay &quot; Powell , will continue or even accelerate its monetary @-@ policy normalization , both by raising its benchmark federal funds rate , and by shrinking its engorged balance sheet .
and we should hope that economic conditions allow the other major central banks , especially the European Central Bank , to follow suit .
on this front , I predict that the major central banks will continue to normalize monetary policies more gradually than is necessary .
the biggest risk here is that markets may try to test the Fed under its new leadership , for example , if inflation rises faster than anticipated .
third , let us hope that the Republican tax package will , if enacted , deliver on its promise of increased investment , output , productivity , and wages over the coming decade .
here , I predict that the legislation will pass , and that investment in the US over the next few years will be relatively higher than if no action had been taken .
to be sure , whether investment will rise from its currently subdued level will depend on many other factors than the corporate @-@ tax rate .
but the tax package can still be expected to boost output , productivity , and wages .
the question is not if , but when .
if the full effects of the legislation are not felt before the 2018 or 2020 elections , that lag could prove politically consequential .
the biggest danger is that its benefits will be delayed , and that its key provisions will be reversed whenever the Democrats are back in power .
fourth , let us hope that governments everywhere begin to address the looming crisis in public @-@ pension and health @-@ care costs , which have been rising for decades .
as social programs become costlier , they crowd out government expenditures on necessities such as defense , while generating ever more pressure to impose higher growth @-@ suppressing taxes .
Europe , in particular , must not let its cyclical rebound lull it into complacency .
many European Union member states still need to reduce their government debt , and the eurozone needs to resolve its &quot; zombie bank &quot; crisis .
beyond that , structural labor @-@ market reforms of the kind French President Emmanuel Macron is pursuing would be most welcome .
unfortunately , I &apos;m afraid that progress on structural reforms will be sporadic , at best .
the danger is that slow growth will not lead to sufficient wage gains and job creation to defuse the ticking time bomb of high youth unemployment in many countries .
another risk is that reform attempts could provoke a political backlash that would be harmful to long @-@ term investment .
fifth , let us hope that the eurozone can avoid a currency crisis .
this will depend largely on whether German Chancellor Angela Merkel can form a coalition government and restore political stability to Europe &apos;s largest economy .
sixth , we should hope that the EU and the UK can agree on a reasonable Brexit deal that will preserve fairly strong trade relations .
the main risk here is that localized declines in trade could spill over and cause broader harm .
and , beyond Europe , let us hope that negotiations between the US , Canada , and Mexico over the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) will result in an arrangement that still facilitates continental trade .
for trade generally , the biggest risk is that the Trump administration could start a lose @-@ lose trade dispute , owing to its understandable eagerness to help American manufacturing workers .
seventh , let us hope that new policies targeting information and communication technology ( ICT ) strike the right balance among all stakeholders &quot; competing and legitimate concerns .
on one hand , there is reason to worry about certain Internet companies &quot; concentration of market power , particularly in online content and distribution , and about the effects of new technologies on personal privacy , law enforcement , and national security .
on the other hand , new technological advances could deliver immense economic gains .
it is easy to envision a scenario of too much regulation , or of too little .
it is also easy to envision a large @-@ scale public backlash against the major technology companies , particularly if poor self @-@ policing or a refusal to cooperate with law enforcement leads to some horrible event .
here , I predict that achieving an appropriate policy balance will take years .
if some future event strikes an emotional chord , the public &apos;s mood could swing dramatically .
ultimately , however , I suspect that competition and innovation will survive the forthcoming regulations .
finally , and most important , let us hope that terrorism is thwarted everywhere , conflicts subside , democracy and capitalism regain some momentum , and greater civility and honest dialogue return to the public domain .
should that happen in 2018 , it will be a very good year indeed .
the World Economy Without China
new HAVEN - Is the Chinese economy about to implode ?
with its debt overhangs and property bubbles , its zombie state @-@ owned enterprises and struggling banks , China is increasingly portrayed as the next disaster in a crisis @-@ prone world .
I remain convinced that such fears are overblown , and that China has the strategy , wherewithal , and commitment to achieve a dramatic structural transformation into a services @-@ based consumer society while successfully dodging daunting cyclical headwinds .
but I certainly recognize that this is now a minority opinion .
for example , US Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew continues to express the rather puzzling view that the United States &quot; can &apos;t be the only engine in the world economy . &quot;
actually , it &apos;s not : the Chinese economy is on track to contribute well over four times as much to global growth as the US this year .
but maybe Lew is already assuming the worst for China in his assessment of the world economy .
so what if the China doubters are right ?
what if China &apos;s economy does indeed come crashing down , with its growth rate plunging into low single digits , or even negative territory , as would be the case in most crisis economies ?
China would suffer , of course , but so would an already @-@ shaky global economy .
with all the handwringing over the Chinese economy , it &apos;s worth considering this thought experiment in detail .
for starters , without China , the world economy would already be in recession .
China &apos;s growth rate this year appears set to hit 6.7 % - considerably higher than most forecasters have been expecting .
according to the International Monetary Fund - the official arbiter of global economic metrics - the Chinese economy accounts for 17.3 % of world GDP ( measured on a purchasing @-@ power @-@ parity basis ) .
a 6.7 % increase in Chinese real GDP thus translates into about 1.2 percentage points of world growth . absent China , that contribution would need to be subtracted from the IMF &apos;s downwardly revised 3.1 % estimate for world GDP growth in 2016 , dragging it down to 1.9 % - well below the 2.5 % threshold commonly associated with global recessions .
of course , that &apos;s just the direct effect of a world without China .
then there are cross @-@ border linkages with other major economies .
the so @-@ called resource economies - namely , Australia , New Zealand , Canada , Russia , and Brazil - would be hit especially hard .
as a resource @-@ intensive growth juggernaut , China has transformed these economies , which collectively account for nearly 9 % of world GDP .
while all of them argue that they have diversified economic structures that are not overly dependent on Chinese commodity demand , currency markets say otherwise : whenever China &apos;s growth expectations are revised - upward or downward - their exchange rates move in tandem .
the IMF currently projects that these five economies will contract by a combined 0.7 % in 2016 , reflecting ongoing recessions in Russia and Brazil and modest growth in the other three .
needless to say , in a China implosion scenario , this baseline estimate would be revised downward significantly .
the same would be the case for China &apos;s Asian trading partners - most of which remain export @-@ dependent economies , with the Chinese market their largest source of external demand .
that is true not only of smaller Asian developing economies such as Indonesia , the Philippines , and Thailand , but also of the larger and more developed economies in the region , such as Japan , Korea , and Taiwan .
collectively , these six China @-@ dependent Asian economies make up another 11 % of world GDP .
a China implosion could easily knock at least one percentage point off their combined growth rate .
the United States is also a case in point .
China is America &apos;s third @-@ largest and most rapidly growing export market .
in a China @-@ implosion scenario , that export demand would all but dry up - knocking approximately 0.2 @-@ 0.3 percentage points off already subpar US economic growth of around 1.6 % in 2016 .
finally , there is Europe to consider .
growth in Germany , long the engine of an otherwise sclerotic Continental economy , remains heavily dependent on exports .
that is due increasingly to the importance of China - now Germany &apos;s third @-@ largest export market , after the European Union and the United States .
in a China implosion scenario , German economic growth could also be significantly lower , dragging down the rest of a German @-@ led Europe .
interestingly , in its just @-@ released October update of the World Economic Outlook , the IMF devotes an entire chapter to what it calls a China spillover analysis - a model @-@ based assessment of the global impacts of a China slowdown .
consistent with the arguments above , the IMF focuses on linkages to commodity exporters , Asian exporters , and what they call &quot; systemic advanced economies &quot; ( Germany , Japan , and the US ) that would be most exposed to a Chinese downturn .
by their reckoning , the impact on Asia would be the largest , followed closely by the resource economies ; the sensitivity of the three developed economies is estimated to be about half that of China &apos;s non @-@ Japan Asian trading partners .
the IMF research suggests that China &apos;s global spillovers would add about another 25 % to the direct effects of China &apos;s growth shortfall .
that means that if Chinese economic growth vanished into thin air , in accordance with our thought experiment , the sum of the direct effects ( 1.2 percentage points of global growth ) and indirect spillovers ( roughly another 0.3 percentage points ) would essentially halve the current baseline estimate of 2016 global growth , from 3.1 % to 1.6 % .
while that would be far short of the record 0.1 % global contraction in 2009 , it wouldn &apos;t be much different than two earlier deep world recessions , in 1975 ( 1 % growth ) and 1982 ( 0.7 % ) .
I may be one of the only China optimists left .
while I am hardly upbeat about prospects for the global economy , I think the world faces far bigger problems than a major meltdown in China .
yet I would be the first to concede that a post @-@ crisis world economy without Chinese growth would be in grave difficulty .
China bears need to be careful what they wish for .
the Return of Currency Wars
new YORK - The recent decision by the Bank of Japan to increase the scope of its quantitative easing is a signal that another round of currency wars may be under way .
the BOJ &apos;s effort to weaken the yen is a beggar @-@ thy @-@ neighbor approach that is inducing policy reactions throughout Asia and around the world .
central banks in China , South Korea , Taiwan , Singapore , and Thailand , fearful of losing competitiveness relative to Japan , are easing their own monetary policies - or will soon ease more .
the European Central Bank and the central banks of Switzerland , Sweden , Norway , and a few Central European countries are likely to embrace quantitative easing or use other unconventional policies to prevent their currencies from appreciating .
all of this will lead to a strengthening of the US dollar , as growth in the United States is picking up and the Federal Reserve has signaled that it will begin raising interest rates next year .
but , if global growth remains weak and the dollar becomes too strong , even the Fed may decide to raise interest rates later and more slowly to avoid excessive dollar appreciation .
the cause of the latest currency turmoil is clear : in an environment of private and public deleveraging from high debts , monetary policy has become the only available tool to boost demand and growth .
fiscal austerity has exacerbated the impact of deleveraging by exerting a direct and indirect drag on growth .
lower public spending reduces aggregate demand , while declining transfers and higher taxes reduce disposable income and thus private consumption .
in the eurozone , a sudden stop of capital flows to the periphery and the fiscal restraints imposed , with Germany &apos;s backing , by the European Union , the International Monetary Fund , and the ECB have been a massive impediment to growth .
in Japan , an excessively front @-@ loaded consumption @-@ tax increase killed the recovery achieved this year .
in the US , a budget sequester and other tax and spending policies led to a sharp fiscal drag in 2012 @-@ 2014 .
and in the United Kingdom , self @-@ imposed fiscal consolidation weakened growth until this year .
globally , the asymmetric adjustment of creditor and debtor economies has exacerbated this recessionary and deflationary spiral .
countries that were overspending , under @-@ saving , and running current @-@ account deficits have been forced by markets to spend less and save more .
not surprisingly , their trade deficits have been shrinking .
but most countries that were over @-@ saving and under @-@ spending have not saved less and spent more ; their current @-@ account surpluses have been growing , aggravating the weakness of global demand and thus undermining growth .
as fiscal austerity and asymmetric adjustment have taken their toll on economic performance , monetary policy has borne the burden of supporting faltering growth via weaker currencies and higher net exports .
but the resulting currency wars are partly a zero @-@ sum game : if one currency is weaker , another currency must be stronger ; and if one country &apos;s trade balance improves , another &apos;s must worsen .
of course , monetary easing is not purely zero @-@ sum .
easing can boost growth by lifting asset prices ( equities and housing ) , reducing private and public borrowing costs , and limiting the risk of a fall in actual and expected inflation .
given fiscal drag and private deleveraging , lack of sufficient monetary easing in recent years would have led to double and triple dip recession ( as occurred , for example , in the eurozone ) .
but the overall policy mix has been sub @-@ optimal , with too much front @-@ loaded fiscal consolidation and too much unconventional monetary policy ( which has become less effective over time ) .
a better approach in advanced economies would have comprised less fiscal consolidation in the short run and more investment in productive infrastructure , combined with a more credible commitment to medium- and long @-@ term fiscal adjustment - and less aggressive monetary easing .
you can lead a horse to liquidity , but you can &apos;t make it drink .
in a world where private aggregate demand is weak and unconventional monetary policy eventually becomes like pushing on a string , the case for slower fiscal consolidation and productive public infrastructure spending is compelling .
such spending offers returns that are certainly higher than the low interest rates that most advanced economies face today , and infrastructure needs are massive in both advanced and emerging economies ( with the exception of China , which has overinvested in infrastructure ) .
moreover , public investment works on both the demand and supply sides .
it not only boosts aggregate demand directly ; it also expands potential output by increasing the stock of productivity @-@ boosting capital .
unfortunately , the political economy of austerity has led to sub @-@ optimal outcomes .
in a fiscal crunch , the first spending cuts hit productive public investments , because governments prefer to protect current - and often inefficient - spending on public @-@ sector jobs and transfer payments to the private sector .
as a result , the global recovery remains anemic in most advanced economies ( with the partial exception of the US and the UK ) and now also in the major emerging countries , where growth has slowed sharply in the last two years .
the right policies - less fiscal austerity in the short run , more public investment spending , and less reliance on monetary easing - are the opposite of those that have been pursued by the world &apos;s major economies .
no wonder global growth keeps on disappointing .
in a sense , we are all Japanese now .
a Roadmap to End Cholera
Geneva - &quot; Where is your toilet ? &quot;
this is often the first question I ask when I visit the site of a cholera outbreak anywhere in the world .
more often than not , the answer is : &quot; we don &apos;t have one .
we go wherever we can . &quot;
cholera , an ancient disease , has become a disease of poverty .
it does not discriminate geographically , but it preys mostly on vulnerable communities in areas with poor sanitation .
carried by contaminated floodwaters to sources of drinking water , transported by unsuspecting travelers , or brought into homes on produce irrigated with untreated sewage , the Vibrio cholerae bacterium settles in the small intestine after it is ingested , causing severe diarrhea and dehydration .
those who are fortunate enough never to have witnessed cholera &apos;s effects firsthand might assume that it is just another stomach bug .
but without swift medical attention , cholera can sap the life out of an adult or child in a matter of hours .
each year , cholera claims the lives of an estimated 95,000 people ; many who die are children .
this year , images of listless , glassy @-@ eyed cholera victims awaiting treatment have emerged in countries worldwide .
the disease has spread at an unprecedented rate in Yemen , where more than 2,000 people have died since April .
cholera outbreaks are ongoing in Somalia , South Sudan , Haiti , and other countries across sub @-@ Saharan Africa and Asia .
but the saddest fact about cholera &apos;s recent toll on human lives is that every single death was preventable .
the world already has the knowledge and tools to control cholera effectively , but existing resources are not being aligned with the necessary global commitments .
that is why the new global strategy developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control , a diverse network of technical partners , is so vital .
ending Cholera - A Global Roadmap to 2030 emphasizes a shift to proactive approaches , and aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90 % over the next decade .
with full implementation , the plan could also help as many as 20 countries eliminate disease transmission in the same timeframe .
based on three pillars - early detection , integrated prevention tactics , and coordination between countries and partners - the roadmap provides a concrete path for ending cholera as a public health threat .
once cholera grips a community , it becomes increasingly difficult to control .
it is important , therefore , that the disease is not forgotten even when it is not claiming victims .
a multi @-@ sector approach that includes investments in water , sanitation , and hygiene - so @-@ called WASH services - can keep cholera at bay .
so can the proactive use of oral cholera vaccines and quick access to treatments , such as oral rehydration solution and intravenous fluids .
improving WASH infrastructure is the most effective path to prevention , though implementing these services will take time in countries with fewer resources .
for this reason , the roadmap also encourages the preemptive and large @-@ scale deployment of oral vaccines in cholera hotspots .
the vaccines work immediately , and can prevent cholera for up to three years , serving as a bridge to the implementation of longer @-@ term solutions .
oral cholera vaccines are available via a global stockpile maintained by the World Health Organization , with support from Gavi , the Vaccine Alliance .
more than 15 million doses have been distributed to 18 countries since the program &apos;s creation in 2013 .
next year , the stockpile is set to increase to more than 25 million doses , up from two million when it began .
ending cholera as a health threat by 2030 , as global partners and the WHO recently pledged , will require sustained collaboration and commitment from cholera @-@ affected countries , technical partners , and international donors .
the goal may seem daunting , given that millions of people around the world are at risk of contracting the disease each year .
but with urbanization , climate change , and other factors likely to increase the threat of infection , it is a goal that must be met .
the roadmap makes this possible .
implementing the plan will prove to be a cost @-@ effective solution for countries saddled with responding to frequent cholera outbreaks .
that is one reason why action is urgently needed .
but embracing the strategy is also the right thing to do for the international community .
governments have a moral obligation to ensure that no one succumbs to a preventable death .
it is an obligation the WHO shares , and it is why we will work hard to help the world meet the ambitious targets we have set .
we have the tools needed to beat cholera .
now , with a plan in place , there can no longer be any excuse not to put them to use .
a Tipping Point Missed
Washington , DC - Before America and the world settle in firmly to the new Donald Trump @-@ based reality , let &apos;s take a little trip down the road not taken .
suppose we had woken up last Wednesday morning to a President @-@ elect Hillary Clinton .
and let &apos;s say that , instead of former Portuguese Prime Minister António Guterres , New Zealand &apos;s Helen Clark or Bulgaria &apos;s Kristalina Georgieva had been picked to succeed Ban Ki @-@ moon as United Nations Secretary @-@ General .
Clinton would have joined the United Kingdom &apos;s Theresa May and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , helping achieve critical mass in the G7 .
and a female UN Secretary @-@ General would have placed women at the helm of two of the world &apos;s three biggest international organizations ( France &apos;s Christine Lagarde already runs the International Monetary Fund ) .
with so many female leaders , we would have begun to answer the question : what happens when women run the world ?
would the world be better for women ?
would it even be different ?
according to sociologists , female leaders are of two schools : Queen Bees , who are less likely to help other women advance , and Righteous Women , who make the advancement of other women a priority .
most early pioneers , such as the UK &apos;s Margaret Thatcher , India &apos;s Indira Gandhi , and Israel &apos;s Golda Meir , were Queen Bees ; all of them eschewed feminism .
more recently , Righteous Women have prevailed .
leaders like Argentina &apos;s Cristina Kirchner , Brazil &apos;s Dilma Rousseff , and Iceland &apos;s Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir have all sought , in one way or another , to empower women and help them advance in their countries .
Merkel and May have tended to be more like Queen Bees , while Clinton , Lagarde , Clark , and Georgieva are more like Righteous Women .
to be fair , the first woman leader in a male @-@ dominated culture must often outman the men .
seeking to advance other women can highlight her own womanhood and thereby weaken her .
Clinton , for example , was the third woman US Secretary of State but the first who felt secure enough to be able to champion the cause of women and girls worldwide .
as President , she pledged , half her cabinet would be women , and she would further the State Department initiatives launched during her tenure .
yes , she also would have been careful to avoid being defined as a woman president .
still , just the presence of a plurality of women has an impact .
for example , studies of US courts with multiple judges show that male judges are more willing to hear bias cases when one woman is on the bench , and significantly more willing when a second woman is added .
&quot; each of us , &quot; noted Sandra Day O &apos;Connor , the first female member of the US Supreme Court , who was renowned for not wanting to be perceived as a &quot; female &quot; justice , &quot; brings to our job , whatever it is , our lifetime of experience and our values . &quot;
in other words , women bring a fresh perspective , heard clearly only when a critical mass of them is present in any institution .
consider a woman &apos;s perspective on conflict .
evidence does not support the stereotype that women are more pacifist than men - the peacemakers and settlers of male disputes .
women can be Amazons ; recall Thatcher &apos;s prosecution of the Falklands War and her admonition to George H.W. Bush not to &quot; go wobbly &quot; in the run @-@ up to the first Gulf War .
on the other hand , when men see wars , they naturally imagine the world of the warriors , whereas women see themselves in the women who must try to shelter their families from forces they cannot control .
that is precisely the diversity of perspective that is vital to decision @-@ making .
and indeed , the Institute for Inclusive Security at Harvard &apos;s Kennedy School has tracked the differences women make as part of peace negotiations .
an acute awareness of the magnitude of civilian suffering in conflicts such as the Syrian civil war or the ongoing horrors in the Congo Basin , and an appreciation of how cycles of violence perpetuate themselves over generations , can actually make women much more likely to urge the use of force in interventions .
former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright famously chided Colin Powell for his reluctance to involve the US military in the Balkans in the 1990s , in part because of her own family &apos;s experience as Czech refugees from Communism .
overall , a woman leader &apos;s decisions are no more predictable than a male leader &apos;s .
women are not monolithic : they have various ideological backgrounds and diverse governing styles .
but when the world finally reaches the point when women are not a rarity at the tables of power , when their numbers reach a tipping point , their voices will be heard differently , and their opinions will hold more weight with the men around them .
women came closer in 2016 than in any other era to reaching that tipping point .
but we may still have to wait decades to find out what will happen when we finally do .
Homesick Politics
Madrid - World order - or the lack thereof - is a hot topic these days .
our fixation with the future of global structures and systems is evident everywhere - in the news and at conferences , on bestseller lists , even in popular television shows .
people are anxious .
the world seems to be undergoing fundamental change : new actors are emerging on the world stage , previously sacrosanct rules of international behavior are being openly defied , and a new wave of technological progress is disrupting entire industries and economic sectors .
in our quest for structure and predictability - a natural impulse in times of rapid change - we are desperate for hints about how the world , and our role in it , will develop .
it is of course vital in such situations that we identify the best , or at least the most feasible , way forward ; predictability provides a foundation for cost @-@ benefit analysis and strategic thinking .
the problem arises when our yearning for certainty overwhelms rational thinking , taking our ideas and actions in an unproductive - or even dangerous - direction .
the current trend toward rose @-@ colored retrospection is a case in point .
faced with political , economic , geostrategic , and social uncertainty , policymakers have increasingly succumbed to the allure of nostalgia , promising a return to what they portray as the familiar and complete rules and practices of the past .
in Russia , President Vladimir Putin has been operating according to a nineteenth @-@ century worldview , in which great powers dominate their spheres of influence unchallenged .
as he noted at last October &apos;s meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club , &quot; The bear will not even bother to ask permission .
here , we consider it the master of the taiga . &quot;
the Islamic State is attempting to return to an even more distant past .
its adherents espouse a medieval ninth @-@ century doctrine to justify their effort to reestablish the caliphate , in which &quot; the legality of all emirates , groups , states , and organizations becomes null &quot; and summary execution and slavery are mandatory .
the West , too , has fallen into the trap of nostalgia , clinging to a late @-@ twentieth @-@ century conception of order in which it makes the rules and can choose whether to follow them .
the latest example of this anachronistic perspective is America &apos;s ham @-@ fisted ( not to mention failed ) attempt to stem support for the China @-@ led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , after repeatedly refusing to provide a greater voice for the world &apos;s emerging powers in the Bretton Woods institutions .
nostalgia has also emerged as a major factor in many countries &quot; domestic affairs .
throughout Europe , populist parties - from the right @-@ wing United Kingdom Independence Party to the far @-@ left Syriza in Greece - seek a return to the ostensibly simpler and happier times of national control and closed borders .
in the US , a prominent strain of jurisprudence defends the &quot; original intent &quot; of the Constitution &apos;s framers , while Republicans are shifting toward isolationism and Democrats are denouncing free @-@ trade agreements .
but nostalgia offers no solutions - only a dream of escape .
looking backward gets us no closer to what we want ; on the contrary , it is a surefire way to miss the challenges - and miss out on the opportunities - that lie before us .
trying to advance one &apos;s interests based on the rules of the past is like trying to solve today &apos;s crossword puzzle using yesterday &apos;s clues .
let &apos;s face it : the halcyon world to which many people are so eager to return - before , say , the European Union or the United Nations or even the nation @-@ state - never really existed .
as Marcel Proust noted : &quot; remembrance of things past is not necessarily the remembrance of things as they were . &quot;
the past is being abridged and sugarcoated in order to portray it as superior to the widespread tumult and misery of today .
over time , nostalgia has come to have a benign connotation .
but the word - a combination of the Greek nostos ( homecoming ) and algos ( pain ) - was coined to describe the disease of &quot; acute homesickness . &quot;
perhaps it would be beneficial to return to that definition of nostalgia , at least in its political manifestation , as something more akin to an illness : a condition that distorts reality and impedes the formulation of effective solutions for real @-@ world challenges .
no worldview rooted in the nineteenth century - much less in the ninth century - is adequate to the complexities of today &apos;s globalized world .
likewise , the rise of new powers and non @-@ state actors means that rule making ( and breaking ) can no longer be restricted to a small Western club .
and the intensity of global competition means that European countries cannot hope to thrive independently of one another .
flimsy ideas thrive in the absence of a viable alternative .
that is why a period of reflection on world order is so important .
but , rather than allowing ourselves to be swept up in the regressive tide of nostalgia , we need to engage one another in a constructive conversation about the challenges that we actually face and propose new ideas for addressing them .
managing a World of Great Powers
Madrid - Today , great @-@ power competition is a fact : the United States now competes with an increasingly active Russia and a rising China .
the Middle East , the South China Sea , and Ukraine are just three theaters where this new reality is playing out .
upon rereading former US Deputy Secretary of State strobe Talbott &apos;s book The Great Experiment , I was left with the impression that the seeds of some of the dynamics at play today were sown some time ago .
the book describes a conversation that took place in December 2000 between President Bill Clinton and President @-@ elect George W. Bush .
Clinton says that , judging by Bush &apos;s electoral campaign , the security issues that seemed to concern him most were Saddam Hussein and the construction of a large @-@ scale antimissile defense system .
&quot; that &apos;s absolutely right , &quot; Bush responds .
these issues were put on hold when tragedy unexpectedly struck , in the form of the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the US , which brought a period of international cooperation during which solidarity against terrorism reigned .
it was a time when we were all Americans , and when Bush described Putin as &quot; very straightforward and trustworthy . &quot;
the winds began to change that December , when the US announced that it was withdrawing from the antiballistic Missile Treaty , in order to build an antimissile defense system to protect itself from a potentially nuclearized Iran .
this did not go unnoticed in Russia .
the US at the time did not seem to understand that a multipolar world order was emerging - one that would make it very difficult to pursue , without serious consequences , the policies that Bush and Clinton had discussed in 2000 .
in a 2007 speech at the Munich Security Conference , Russian President Vladimir Putin made this plain , vehemently rejecting the intervention in Iraq and especially US plans to expand antimissile defense systems to Europe , calling this an act of aggression toward Russia and a breach of common European security .
in the summer of 2008 , three events placed the new multipolar order in stark relief .
China dazzled the world as host of the Olympic Games , reinforcing its status as a significant international player .
Russia &apos;s military actions in Georgia - in the midst of the Games - showed the world that the concept of spheres of influence was still alive and well in the Kremlin .
and the collapse the following month of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers , which unleashed a global financial crisis from which the world economy has yet to recover fully , underscored the advanced economies &quot; vulnerabilities , while largely sparing China .
with a new sense of confidence in its great @-@ power status , China seemed to qualify the concept of a &quot; peaceful rise &quot; that its leaders have invoked since the era of Deng Xiaoping , adopting a more muscular foreign @-@ policy approach within its neighborhood .
drawing on alleged historical rights , China began to expand its territorial claims , along with its military presence , in the South and East China Seas .
in 2013 , tensions peaked when China unilaterally declared an Air Defense Identification Zone ( ADIZ ) covering territories in the East China Sea that it claims , but Japan controls .
many of the countries affected by China &apos;s actions in the South and East China Seas have security treaties with the US , which has been the major maritime power in the Pacific region since World War II .
China &apos;s ADIZ declaration was therefore viewed by the US as a provocation .
by expanding its sovereignty claims , China was actually expanding its claims to influence .
it has taken the international institutions some time to catch up to the changing world order .
the 2010 G @-@ 20 summit in Seoul produced an agreement to increase the emerging countries &quot; quotas in the International Monetary Fund by 2014 .
but the US Congress refused to ratify the changes , so nothing came of the agreement .
China then took matters into its own hands , spearheading the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank .
fragmentation of the international institutions seemed imminent - that is , until European countries decided to join the AIIB .
though the US resisted at first , and has still refused to join , that decision was lent some nuance in a later conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Barack Obama .
meanwhile , Russia was exposing its own renewed foreign @-@ policy ambitions in Ukraine .
by violating the Helsinki Final Act in the spring of 2014 , Putin placed Russian foreign policy in direct opposition to that of the US and Europe .
this position was reaffirmed in September , when Putin decided to intervene in the Syrian conflict , securing for Russia a role in any attempt to bring peace to the country .
today , the world is very different from what some might have imagined at the end of the last century , a decade after the Berlin Wall came down .
historically speaking , 15 years can seem long or short , depending on the intensity of change .
during the last 15 years of mounting great @-@ power competition and renewed instability in the Middle East - including the Arab Spring , the rise of the brutal Islamic State , Sunni @-@ Shia proxy wars , and unspeakable human suffering - change has been very intense , to say the least .
but confrontation is not the whole story .
promising steps have been made in two critical areas : nuclear non @-@ proliferation , especially through the nuclear deal with Iran , and the fight against climate change , exemplified in the encouraging preparations for the current climate summit in Paris .
if there is one lesson to be learned from all of this , it is that well @-@ executed , tenacious diplomacy still holds extraordinary power to resolve conflicts .
it remains the best instrument to produce those cooperative outcomes that confrontation effectively impedes .
how Press Freedom Is Won
Accra - Every year on May 3 - World Press Freedom Day - news producers and consumers pause to reflect on the state of global media .
this year , as journalists and government officials gather in Ghana for the event &apos;s 25th observance , attention will turn to the myriad pressures and challenges confronting the profession worldwide , and how official and state @-@ sponsored hostility toward the press is threatening democracy .
but these concerns , though certainly valid , are not the entire story .
signs of journalistic resilience are also emerging .
so , rather than focusing exclusively on the obstacles journalists around the world are facing , let &apos;s mark May 3 by considering the many reasons for optimism .
for starters , while no media market is immune to erosion of press freedom , resistance is possible .
recent events in Europe are illustrative .
in Slovakia , public outrage over the politically motivated double murder of an investigative journalist , Ján Kuciak , and his fiancée , Martina Kušnírová , forced Prime Minister Robert Fico to resign , and has his successor , Peter Pellegrini , walking a public @-@ relations tightrope .
Hungary , too , has experienced its own , albeit tamer , version of journalistic pushback .
according to a recent study by the European Journalism Center , despite deepening government control over how the media operates , investigative reporting remains active , and &quot; abuses of the taxpayers &quot; money are regularly exposed . &quot;
to be sure , the media are under attack like never before , and not only from fake news and polarizing presidents .
the slaying of nine journalists in Kabul on April 30 , in back @-@ to @-@ back suicide bombings that killed at least 25 people , marked the deadliest day for journalists in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban , and added to a grim global tally .
according to Reporters Without Borders , more than 1,000 journalists have been murdered around the world in the last 15 years , and only a handful of the perpetrators have been brought to justice .
and yet fresh glimmers of hope are multiplying .
around the world , journalists and their supporters are fighting back in encouraging ways .
consider online censorship .
while governments from China to Russia routinely block or filter access to the Internet , half of the world &apos;s population is now connected - a 20 % increase in only five years .
in Sudan , journalists are using this connectivity to save lives .
last year , when the government refused to inform the public about a devastating cholera outbreak , journalists with Radio Dabanga , working with doctors and nurses , used the WhatsApp messaging service to share information about prevention and treatment .
even in a violent and divided country like Somalia , the Internet is being used for good ; increased streaming speeds have kept members of the country &apos;s sizable diaspora connected with friends and family , and have enabled meaningful dialogue across communities .
legal norms are also moving in the right direction .
between 2011 and 2016 , the number of countries with freedom of information laws increased from 90 to 112 .
this commitment was deepened last month when the European Union adopted a new law to protect whistle @-@ blowers from prosecution .
in a statement , authorities said they hoped the measure would be a boon to investigative journalists by protecting sources who report violations of European law .
where fewer legal protections are in place , journalists are becoming more creative .
in the Philippines , where independent news organizations have become targets of slander by politicians and online trolls , reporters are turning the tables with devastating effect .
for example , in a recent series of reports identifying people making threats against the media , the news website Rappler uncovered a network of trolls tied directly to government insiders .
finally , journalists are working to improve the diversity of their own industry .
in the Democratic Republic of Congo , for example , one media organization created a database with the contact details of thousands of female experts who are available for media commentary and analysis .
this simple exercise has led to a dramatic increase in the percentage of female experts appearing in the press .
these are just a few of the bright spots we should be highlighting during this year &apos;s observance of World Press Freedom Day .
every day , courageous men and women ( and sometimes even children ) around the world continue to brave the odds to bring us the news .
we all benefit from their dedication , and we all have an obligation to honor their successes , not just their sacrifices .
worlds Apart
macroeconomic policies , financial globalization , and changes in labor market institutions have exacerbated inequality in recent decades , not only in income and wealth , but also in access to education , healthcare , social protection , as well as in political participation and influence .
even within countries experiencing rapid economic growth , an array of factors , exacerbated by tremendous demographic changes , has conspired to transmit inequality of knowledge , social responsibility , and life chances from one generation to the next .
as surveyed in the United Nations report The Inequality predicament , few countries , rich or poor , have proved immune to the global trend of rising inequality , or to its consequences for education , health , and social welfare .
of course , there is no simple causal relationship linking poverty and inequality to violence .
but inequality and a sense of deprivation do contribute to resentment and social instability , threatening security .
excluded and facing bleak life prospects , young people , in particular , often experience anomie and may turn to anti @-@ social behavior , including violence .
nor is there a simple explanation of what causes poverty .
clearly , however , poverty arises from various complex conditions , and its amelioration requires a multidimensional approach .
it is hard to imagine , for example , how to &quot; make poverty history &quot; without also generating enough decent work , educational opportunities , and healthcare for all .
to be sure , the world has seen progress on some fronts in recent decades .
access to education for girls has improved , and some gender gaps have been reduced .
despite AIDS and the resurgence of malaria and tuberculosis , life expectancy has increased in much of the world due to improved public health systems .
overall , however , the inequality gaps are large and , in many cases , growing .
the most important determinant of income inequality today is wealth inequality , with the increasing concentration of asset ownership in recent years principally responsible for greater income inequality in most countries .
meanwhile , growing unemployment , widening skill and productivity gaps , and the &quot; informalization &quot; or &quot; casualization &quot; of labor markets have exacerbated income inequalities worldwide , as the number of &quot; working poor &quot; and the incidence of &quot; jobless growth &quot; has spread .
nor have stabilization and structural adjustment programs , imposed since the 1980 &quot; s , delivered on their promise of achieving higher economic growth .
growth in much of the world during the past quarter @-@ century has been slower than in the previous 25 years , despite more rapid growth in East Asia , India , and a few other countries .
such growth differences suggest that overall global inequality may not have increased unequivocally .
but inequalities at the national level have deepened in most countries in recent years , largely due to economic liberalization at both the national and international levels .
indeed , in much of the world , such economic reforms have actually undermined growth rates as well as the progressive role of government , while otherwise increasing overall inequalities .
the few exceptions have been due largely to continued or new progressive government interventions .
but they are exceptions : the cumulative impact of these reforms over the past 25 years has been greater inequality in most developed and developing countries , with rising unemployment , greater earnings disparities , reduced social protection , and environmental degradation .
international financial liberalization , for example , has undermined the use of more inclusive and targeted developmental credit to promote desired economic activities .
in addition , contrary to the promises of its proponents , financial liberalization has actually resulted in net capital flows from the capital @-@ poor to the capital @-@ rich over the long term , while increasing financial volatility and weakening economic activity .
meanwhile , free @-@ trade negotiations seem to ignore historical trends .
developing countries &quot; international terms of trade have worsened : prices of primary commodities have declined in relation to manufactures , as have tropical agriculture prices against temperate agriculture , and prices of generic manufactures have fallen relative to output protected by intellectual property rights .
as a result , trade liberalization of manufactures has resulted in de @-@ industrialization and greater unemployment in much of the world , as in the case of garments this year .
and , while agricultural trade liberalization may enhance export earnings for some poor countries , the main beneficiaries will be the more well @-@ to @-@ do agricultural exporters .
countries that import currently subsidized food will be worse off .
the &quot; retreat of the state &quot; in much of the developing world in recent decades has involved a generally reduced role for government , including the capacity to lead and sustain development , as well as its progressive social interventions in areas such as public education , health , housing , and utilities .
the economic liberalization carried out in much of the world in the last 25 years was a flawed policy from the start , and its consequences have become glaringly obvious .
unless the world refocuses economic policies to address the adverse impact of economic inequality on growth and poverty reduction , the poor and the privileged will continue to live worlds apart .
Whither the Multilateral Trading System ?
Brussels - Free trade seems to have few supporters these days .
though actual trade volumes are recovering from the post @-@ crisis recession and drop in commodity prices , &quot; globalization &quot; has become increasingly contentious , as exemplified by the election of US President Donald Trump on the back of a promise to rip up international agreements and get tough on trade partners .
what does this mean for the future of the rules @-@ based trading system ?
some 60 years ago , when the current rules @-@ based global trading system was conceived , the United States was the world &apos;s sole economic &quot; hyperpower , &quot; possessing unquestioned dominance in the day &apos;s most advanced manufacturing industries .
with enough power to impose rules , and enough dominance to be able to count on accruing the largest share of the benefits , it could - and did - perform the role of &quot; benevolent hegemon . &quot;
as Japan and Europe recovered from World War II - with the latter getting an added boost from economic integration - America &apos;s lead began to dwindle , and by the 1970s and 1980s , the US was sharing power over the world &apos;s trade agenda with Europe .
nonetheless , because the US and Europe share so many common interests , they generally adhered to a cooperative approach .
it was not until imports began to overwhelm a growing number of industries in the US , fueling the emergence of large and persistent external deficits , that the country &apos;s trade policy became more defensive , creating friction with many of its partners .
yet , even then , US leaders understood the value of the liberal multilateral trading system , and supported the establishment , in 1995 , of the World Trade Organization as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade .
the WTO &apos;s creation amounted to a major step forward , as it addressed not just tariffs , but also other trade barriers , including indirect barriers arising from domestic regulations .
given the complexity of assessing how domestic regulations might impede trade , especially compared to judging whether a tariff has been correctly applied , the WTO needed effective dispute @-@ settlement mechanisms , with members agreeing to binding arbitration .
the system worked , because its major members recognized the legitimacy of independent panels , even if they sometimes deliver politically inconvenient judgments .
yet this recognition is now increasingly in doubt .
consider what type of economy would support a rules @-@ based system .
after WWII , the US supported such a system , because of its unassailable economic supremacy .
an open rules @-@ based system would also be highly appealing in a world comprising only small countries , none of which could hope to gain by relying on its relative economic power .
things become more complicated when the global economy includes a small number of economies of similar size , larger than the small economies from the previous example , but not large enough to dominate the system alone .
that is the scenario the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman considered in a 1989 paper on bilateralism , in which he reported that a world consisting of three major trading blocs constitutes the worst constellation for trade , as a lack of explicit cooperation among all three would lead to increasing trade barriers .
unfortunately , this is exactly the situation in which the global economy finds itself today .
there are three dominant economies or trading blocs - China , the European Union , and the US - with very similar trade volumes ( exports plus imports ) of around $ 4 trillion each . ( Japan , which was a strong contender 25 years ago , now has a much smaller trade volume . )
together , the G3 economies account for 40 % of world trade and 45 % of global GDP .
with economic power distributed in this way , explicit cooperation by all three actors is crucial .
yet there are compelling reasons why they would be reticent to pursue such cooperation .
even if Trump weren &apos;t president , the current global trading system would present problems for the US , whose trade policy has long focused on manufactured goods . ( trade in raw materials has always been relatively free , and trade in agricultural goods has usually been considered special , and thus not subject to rules like the &quot; most favored nation &quot; principle , which applies to manufactures . )
because the US is now self @-@ sufficient in energy , it needs to export fewer manufactured goods than industrialized countries with no domestic energy resources .
annual US exports of manufactured goods thus now amount to only about $ 1 trillion annually - significantly less than both the EU and China , which export almost twice as much in manufactured goods , despite having somewhat smaller economies .
to be sure , Trump is unlikely to start an outright trade war , because any US tariff would harm the interests of the country &apos;s largest companies , which have invested huge sums in production facilities abroad .
yet no individual firm will be willing to give up much of its political capital to defend the rules @-@ based system , either , because it would have to bear the losses , while its competitors shared the gains .
the same goes for the G3 trading blocs : if the EU expends political capital to stop the US from undermining WTO mechanisms , China ( and the rest of world ) will reap most of the gains .
that dynamic goes some way toward explaining why China &apos;s leaders , despite having proclaimed their support for the multilateral rules @-@ based trading system , haven &apos;t taken concrete action to reinforce it .
their reticence is probably intensified by the assumption that , within the current generation , their country will dominate the global economy ; at that point , they might no longer want to be bound by somebody else &apos;s rules .
it does not help matters that the Communist Party of China has recently been empowered even further in all areas of the economy , with all major firms now having to accept a CPC representative on their board .
it is difficult to see how a dominant economic power governed by a single party - especially one with such extensive control over the economy - would accept the primacy of international rules and procedures over domestic considerations .
the conclusion is clear . the world should prepare itself for the erosion of the rules @-@ based trading system enshrined in the WTO .
ready or Not for the Next Recession ?
Copenhagen - A sunny day is the best time to check whether the roof is watertight .
for economic policymakers , the proverbial sunny day has arrived : with experts forecasting strong growth , now is the best time to check whether we are prepared for the next recession .
the answer , for the United States in particular , is a resounding no .
policymakers normally respond to recessions by cutting interest rates , reducing taxes , and boosting transfers to the unemployed and other casualties of the downturn .
but the US is singularly ill @-@ prepared , for a combination of economic and political reasons , to respond normally .
most obviously , the US Federal Reserve &apos;s target for the federal funds rate is still only 1.25 % -1.5 % .
if no recession is imminent , the Fed may succeed in raising rates three times by the end of the year , to around 2 % .
but that would still leave little room for monetary easing in response to recessionary trends before the policy rate hits zero again .
in the last three recessions , the Fed &apos;s cumulative interest @-@ rate cuts have been close to five full percentage points .
this time , because slow recovery has permitted only gradual normalization of interest rates , and because there appears to have been a tendency for interest rates to trend downward more generally , the Fed lacks room to react .
in principle , the Fed could launch another round of quantitative easing .
in addition , at least one of US President Donald Trump &apos;s nominees to the Federal Reserve Board has mooted the idea of negative interest rates .
that said , this Fed board , with its three Trump appointees , is likely to be less activist and innovative than its predecessor .
and criticism by the US Congress of any further expansion of the Fed &apos;s balance sheet would be certain and intense .
fiscal policy is the obvious alternative , but Congress has cut taxes at the worst possible time , leaving no room for stimulus when it is needed .
adding $ 1.5 trillion more to the federal debt will create an understandable reluctance to respond to a downturn with further tax cuts .
as my Berkeley colleagues Christina and David Romer have shown , fiscal policy is less effective in countering recessions , and less likely to be used , when a country has already incurred a high public debt .
instead of stimulating the economy in the next downturn , the Republicans in Congress are likely to respond perversely .
as revenues fall and the deficit widens even faster , they will insist on spending cuts to return the debt trajectory to its previous path .
congressional Republicans will most likely start with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , which provides food to low @-@ income households .
snap is already in their sights . they will then proceed to cut Medicare , Medicaid , and Social Security .
the burden of these spending cuts will fall on hand @-@ to @-@ mouth consumers , who will reduce their own spending dollar for dollar , denting aggregate demand .
for their part , state governments , forced by new limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes to pare their budgets , are likely to move further in the direction of limiting the duration of unemployment benefits and the extent of their own food and nutrition assistance .
nor will global conditions favor the US .
foreign central banks , from Europe to Japan , have similarly scant room to cut interest rates . even after a government in Germany is finally formed , policymakers there will continue to display their characteristic reluctance to use fiscal policy .
and if Germany doesn &apos;t use its fiscal space , there will be little room for its eurozone partners to do so .
more than that , scope for the kind of international cooperation that helped to halt the 2008 @-@ 2009 contraction has been destroyed by Trump &apos;s &quot; America First &quot; agenda , which paints one @-@ time allies as enemies .
other countries will work with the US government to counter the next recession only if they trust its judgment and intentions .
and trust in the US may be the quantity in shortest supply .
in 2008 @-@ 2009 , the Fed extended dollar swap lines to foreign central banks , but came under congressional fire for &quot; giving away &quot; Americans &quot; hard @-@ earned money .
then , at the London G20 summit in early 2009 , President Barack Obama &apos;s administration made a commitment to coordinate its fiscal stimulus with that of other governments .
today , almost a decade later , it is hard to imagine the Trump administration even showing up at an analogous meeting .
the length of an economic expansion is not a reliable predictor of when the next downturn will come .
and the depth and shape of that recession will depend on the event triggering it , which is similarly uncertain .
the one thing we know for sure , though , is that expansions don &apos;t last forever .
a storm will surely come , and when it does , we will be poorly prepared for the deluge .
an Opportunity for the WTO
Ontario - This December , trade ministers from around the world will converge in Buenos Aires for the World Trade Organization &apos;s 11th Ministerial Conference .
with the United States , which has historically led the world toward trade liberalization , now actively stoking trade tensions , the meeting is set to be unlike any other .
the WTO &apos;s ministerial gatherings are never easy .
some kind of agreement is usually delivered , but only at the last minute , and its language is often vague .
this time , however , the outcome might be even more disappointing , with delegates unable to reach even a symbolic agreement that they can tout with an aggressive marketing campaign .
the current tensions over free trade , rooted in the uneven distribution of its benefits , cannot be resolved within the WTO , let alone by a ministerial gathering .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that the upcoming conference must be for naught .
on the contrary , it should serve as a critical opportunity to initiate the update and recalibration that the WTO needs to remain an effective platform for international trade cooperation and consensus @-@ building .
one key problem that must be addressed relates to &quot; special and differential treatment &quot; ( S &amp; D ) .
about two thirds of the WTO &apos;s 164 members have declared themselves developing countries - a label that entitles them to S &amp; D provisions , including the authority to maintain trade tariffs for a longer period of time .
with the WTO lacking any benchmarks or indicators to determine when a country should be weaned off S &amp; D , it is no surprise that no developing country has ever &quot; developed . &quot;
to be sure , since S &amp; D was first introduced in 1979 , many developing countries have grown richer . but they have shown no indication that they are ready to relinquish the benefits of S &amp; D , even for industries that have become internationally competitive .
it is hard to argue that all developing countries should enjoy the indefinite privilege of opting out of the WTO &apos;s general obligations for all sectors of their economies .
and with so many of their WTO partners claiming preferential status , developed @-@ country members often resist trade concessions within the organization , preferring to conduct negotiations in other forums .
the dynamic in the WTO stands in stark contrast to that within the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank .
at the WTO , developed countries would like to see big emerging markets take on more obligations , while developing countries resist . at the Bretton Woods institutions , developed countries are blocking emerging economies from gaining greater influence .
but the two dynamics have something in common : intransigence , even if coming from different quarters , reflects a denial of reality .
in the Bretton Woods institutions , the emerging economies are right that their increased economic weight should correlate with larger capital contributions and more weight in decision @-@ making .
in the WTO , S &amp; D clearly needs to be updated to ensure that it benefits only countries that actually need it .
ministers at the conference in Buenos Aires should thus be prepared to have an honest discussion about S &amp; D .
a second topic that the WTO needs to address relates to consensus @-@ building .
under current WTO rules , most decisions can be adopted by a majority vote .
but the long @-@ standing practice has been to adopt all decisions by consensus .
this is wise and should not change .
though consensus @-@ building can be slow and cumbersome , it is the only way to generate the legitimacy that WTO decisions need .
a simple majority vote , after all , would fail to account for differences in market size .
and weighted voting would undermine the WTO &apos;s capacity to settle disputes by adjudicating rights and obligations among members of different size and political heft .
the problem is that consensus is interpreted as an unlimited veto power , such that a member can block any discussion on matters of interest to others .
a consensus @-@ based approach can work only if it entails an obligation by all members to work toward shared interests , with members objecting formally only to decisions running counter to some fundamental interest .
the Paris climate agreement was made possible by a simple method called &quot; Indaba , &quot; adopted from the Zulu and Xhosa people of South Africa . negotiators had the right to withhold consent , but only if they put forth alternate proposals aimed at finding common ground .
if Indaba worked in Paris , it could also work at the WTO .
in Buenos Aires , ministers should discuss how to ensure that WTO members responsibly exercise their right to block decisions .
the final issue that ministers should be prepared to discuss in Buenos Aires is the need to ensure that the WTO adapts effectively to a changing international environment .
the problems with both S &amp; D and consensus decision @-@ making at the WTO are not new , but they have long been ignored , allowing them to deepen .
this would not have happened if incremental reform was ingrained in the WTO &apos;s regular activities .
both the IMF and the World Bank have policy watchdogs that regularly scrutinize and evaluate their functioning .
running on very small budgets , these ruthless truth @-@ tellers regularly force their institutions &quot; leaders to have honest discussions about organizational effectiveness and possible reforms .
such an independent office for evaluation is precisely what the WTO needs .
the WTO cannot sweep its problems under the carpet forever .
the question is whether it will undertake the reforms it needs now or wait until a costly crisis leaves it no choice .
the WTO Reborn ?
new DELHI - For too long , the World Trade Organization has languished , to lift a reference from T.S. Eliot , by the &quot; waters of Leman &quot; ( Lake Geneva ) .
once the world &apos;s preeminent multilateral trade forum , the WTO has been steadily marginalized in recent years , and recent rebukes of globalization , such as the United Kingdom &apos;s Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president , suggest that this trend will accelerate .
but these outcomes may actually have the opposite effect , owing to three key developments that could enable the revival of the WTO - and of the multilateralism that it embodies .
the first development is the decline of alternative trade arrangements .
the WTO reached its peak in the early 2000s , a few years after the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations concluded , and a time when more countries - most notably China - were acceding to the organization .
but major trade players like the United States and the European Union subsequently shifted their focus from multilateral trade agreements to bilateral , regional , and mega @-@ regional deals .
the mega @-@ regionals - namely , the Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) - posed a particularly grave threat to the WTO .
yet those are precisely the deals that the Trump administration is rejecting , or at least postponing .
European integration had a similar impact on the WTO , as it provided an alternative platform for managing intra @-@ European trade .
but the European project has fallen on hard times , the most salient sign being the UK &apos;s impending departure from the EU .
after Brexit , the WTO will probably become an important forum for Britain &apos;s trade relations with the world .
any further disintegration of the EU will only bolster that trend .
of course , it is possible that regional trade agreements in Asia and elsewhere will continue to flourish .
but new leadership would have to emerge .
and no single systemically important country today meets the rigorous requirements of such leadership : internal political stability , economic dynamism , relatively contained risk , and a steadfast commitment to open markets .
however counterintuitive that may sound , a second development that bodes well for the WTO &apos;s revival is voters &quot; increasing rejection of hyper @-@ globalization .
hyper @-@ globalization is essentially &quot; deep &quot; integration .
it goes beyond creating open markets for goods and services to include increased immigration ( in the US and Europe ) , harmonizing regulations ( the ambition of the TPP and the TTIP ) , and intrusive adjudication of domestic policies ( the investor @-@ settlement procedures under NAFTA and the TPP ) .
in the EU &apos;s case , it even entails a common currency .
for such integration , regionalism is much more effective than the WTO .
now that &quot; deep &quot; is out , the WTO could once again become an attractive forum for trading countries to do business .
make no mistake : there will still be a lot of globalization for the WTO to facilitate and manage , not least because of the inexorable march of technology .
the mesh @-@ like structure of trade and investment connecting countries , embodied in global value @-@ chains - what Aaditya Mattoo of the World Bank and I have called &quot; criss @-@ crossing globalization &quot; - will prevent significant backsliding .
the third development that could reinvigorate the WTO is a more protectionist stance by the Trump administration .
if the US raises tariffs or implements a border @-@ adjustment tax favoring exports and penalizing imports , its trade partners are likely to turn to the WTO for adjudication , given the organization &apos;s demonstrated dispute @-@ settlement capability .
the WTO could , therefore , become the place where US trade policies are scrutinized and kept in check .
the universality of WTO membership , previously seen as an impediment to countries eager to move ahead with new rules and agreements , could be its main strength , as it implies a high degree of legitimacy , which is essential to minimize trade tensions and the risk of conflict .
in my book Eclipse , I argued that multilateralism offered the best means for ensuring the peaceful rise of new powers .
but it seems that the same argument could apply equally well to the management of receding powers .
but the WTO &apos;s revival will not happen automatically .
willing stakeholders must actively pursue it .
the most obvious candidates for the job are the mid @-@ size economies that have been the greatest beneficiary of globalization , and that , unlike the US and some European countries , are not currently under pressure from a globalization @-@ averse public .
the champions of multilateralism should include Australia , Brazil , India , Indonesia , Mexico , New Zealand , South Africa , the United Kingdom , and possibly China and Japan .
because none of them is large ( with the exception of China ) , they must work collectively to defend open markets .
moreover , they must open their own markets not only in the traditional areas of agriculture and manufacturing , but also in new areas such as services , investments , and standards .
in doing so , these countries would also be responding to the increasingly transactional approach to sustaining openness that the larger traders are being compelled to adopt .
the world needs a robust response to the decline of hyper @-@ globalization .
multilateralism , championed by mid @-@ size trading economies with a strong interest in preserving openness , may be it .
to the shores of Leman they must now head .
Putin on parade
new YORK - This May &apos;s parade in Moscow to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II promises to be the greatest Victory Day celebration since the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse .
some 16,000 soldiers , 200 armored vehicles , and 150 planes and helicopters are set to pass through and over Red Square .
it will be a scene that would easily have been familiar to Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev , taking the salute atop Lenin &apos;s tomb .
yet , though Russia &apos;s WWII allies were from Europe and North America , no Western leaders will attend the commemoration - a reflection of the West &apos;s disapproval of Putin &apos;s invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea .
instead , Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s high @-@ profile guests will include the leaders of China , India , and North Korea , underscoring just how few friends Russia has these days .
the surreal nature of this gathering reflects the increasingly bizarre nature of Putin &apos;s regime .
indeed , watching Russia nowadays is like watching the last installment of the X @-@ Men film franchise , &quot; Days of Future Past . &quot;
just as the X @-@ Men in that film join forces with their younger selves to save mankind &apos;s future , today &apos;s Kremlin is harking back to Russia &apos;s Soviet past in what it sees as a contemporary fight for the country &apos;s survival .
critical to this strategy is propaganda conflating the West today with the Germans who invaded Russia in 1941 , while painting Ukrainian government officials as &quot; fascists &quot; and &quot; neo @-@ Nazis . &quot;
the Kremlin has relied on such claims , together with the supposed need to defend Russians abroad , to justify its aggression against Ukraine .
in Putin &apos;s speech following the annexation of Crimea , he charged that the West &apos;s refusal &quot; to engage in dialogue &quot; left Russia with no choice .
&quot; we are constantly proposing cooperation on all key issues , &quot; he declared .
&quot; we want to strengthen our level of trust and for our relations to be equal , open , and fair .
but we saw no reciprocal steps . &quot;
a month later , Putin reinforced this image of Russians as the morally superior victims of a cruel and uncompromising West .
&quot; we are less pragmatic than other people , less calculating , &quot; he asserted , before adding that Russia &apos;s &quot; greatness &quot; and &quot; vast size &quot; means &quot; we have a more generous heart . &quot;
it is not difficult to see the parallels between Putin &apos;s approach and that of Joseph Stalin , who declared at the start of WWII that the &quot; enemy &quot; aims to &quot; destroy &quot; Russia &apos;s &quot; national culture , &quot; to &quot; Germanize &quot; its people , and &quot; convert them into slaves . &quot;
the difference , of course , is that the Nazi Wehrmacht actually invaded the Soviet Union , whereas Ukraine simply wanted to decide its own future .
without defending Stalin , one must recognize the immense Soviet contribution - including the lives of 26 million citizens - to the Allied victory in WWII .
at the time , the military parade in Red Square - featuring almost 35,000 troops , up to 1,900 pieces of military equipment , and a 1,400 @-@ man orchestra - was a well @-@ deserved pageant .
the Soviet leadership spared no cost in staging its military displays , which , in the absence of an external military threat , became an important vehicle for rallying national unity .
after the Soviet Union &apos;s collapse , Russia , no longer a superpower , put its military spectacles on ice .
but in 2005 , to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII , Putin held a major parade - one that Western leaders , believing that Russia might have a European future , did attend .
the tone of this year &apos;s Victory Day commemorations is far less anticipatory .
how can one celebrate the end of a war at a time when the descendants of those who fought it ( undoubtedly driven by the hope that future generations would live in peace ) are killing one another in a brutal little war in eastern Ukraine ?
what is the point of grandiose fireworks displays amid the firing of real howitzers and rockets ?
the historian Robert Paxton believed that one could tell much about a country by its parades .
his 1966 book parades and Politics at Vichy describes how Philippe Pétain , as Chief of State of Vichy France , used pageantry , reactionary politics , and , of course , a partnership with Adolf Hitler to dupe his defeated country into believing that it still mattered in the world .
the Vichy state &apos;s brand of authoritarian traditionalism lionized family and fatherland , with Pétain , a former military commander , serving as a kind of military king , exalted on the tribune .
the parallels with Putin &apos;s Russia are clear .
Putin views himself as a new czar .
his KGB background dictates his leadership style , which includes the abolition of free and fair elections , the persecution of opponents , and the promotion of conservative values that he , like Pétain before him , juxtaposes with the corrupting influence of an &quot; immoral &quot; and &quot; decadent &quot; West .
relying on this approach , Putin has built alliances with the likes of Syria &apos;s President Bashar al @-@ Assad and Egypt &apos;s military ruler Abdel Fattah el @-@ Sisi .
China , the world &apos;s second largest economy , is a useful addition to this collection of friendly anti @-@ democratic states , as it has its own strategic grievances with the West .
unlike China , however , Russia is not a rising superpower .
Putin may try to portray his actions in Ukraine as a fight against fascism .
but it is really a fight for relevance - a fight he will never win .
no matter how grand the parade , he cannot hide the truth : Russia &apos;s days as a superpower are in the past .
Putin &apos;s patriotism , like Pétain &apos;s , is that of the vanquished .
Xi &apos;s Strong Hand Against Trump
London - The world will soon witness a historic test of wills between China and the United States , two superpowers whose leaders see themselves as supreme .
in the immediate sense , it will be a battle over trade .
but also at stake is the strategic leadership of East Asia and , eventually , the international order .
as things stand , China holds a stronger position than many people realize .
the question is whether Chinese President Xi Jinping will feel confident or brazen enough to want to prove it .
the test of wills was hardly China &apos;s choice ; but nor does it come as a surprise .
US President Donald Trump &apos;s recently announced import tariffs on steel , aluminum , and other Chinese @-@ made goods are in keeping with his brand of economic nationalism .
and his decision to accept North Korea &apos;s invitation to hold bilateral talks on its nuclear program reflects the same &quot; bring it on &quot; attitude that he applied to the North &apos;s earlier threats of war .
the upcoming test will be historic because it promises to reveal the true strengths and attitudes of the world &apos;s rising power vis @-@ à @-@ vis the weakened but still leading incumbent power . for better or worse , the result could shape the world for decades to come .
on the trade front , China &apos;s large bilateral surplus with the US could mean that it has more to lose from a trade war , simply because it has more exports that can be penalized .
it is often said that surplus countries will always be the biggest losers in any tit @-@ for @-@ tat escalation of tariffs and other barriers .
but this assumption misses multiple points .
for one thing , China is more economically resilient to the effects of a trade war than it used to be .
trade as a share of its total economic activity has halved in the past decade , from more than 60 % of GDP in 2007 to just over 30 % today .
China also has major advantages in terms of domestic politics and international diplomacy .
as a dictatorship , China can ignore protests by workers and companies suffering from US tariffs .
in the US , where mid @-@ term congressional elections will be held this November , the outcry from exporters , importers , and consumers facing higher costs will be heard loud and clear .
of course , Trump , too , might ignore protests against his trade war if he is convinced that taking on China will please his core voters and win him re @-@ election in 2020 .
but congressional Republicans will probably feel differently , especially if their states or districts are among those being singled out by Chinese import tariffs .
in terms of international diplomacy , Trump &apos;s trade war will help China present itself as the defender of the rules @-@ based international order and multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization .
to be sure , not all countries would follow China &apos;s lead .
the WTO does not recognize China as a market economy , owing to the Chinese government &apos;s significant involvement in industry and alleged theft of intellectual property .
but China will have a chance to play the victim , while arguing that the US now poses the single largest threat to the global trading system that it helped create .
and if a US @-@ initiated trade war drags on , China &apos;s case will become only stronger as more countries suffer the disruptive effects of tariffs .
of course , China may choose not to fight Trump &apos;s trade war at all .
with symbolic concessions - such as an agreement to import US @-@ produced liquefied natural gas or promises to offer new guarantees for intellectual @-@ property rights - it could convince Trump to stand down .
but if Xi suspects that a show of strength will bolster China &apos;s international standing while undercutting that of the US , he may decide to act accordingly .
the North Korea issue is more complicated .
but here , too , China will have an advantage .
even barring real progress in the talks , China already looks like a good global citizen .
over the past year , it has been pressuring the North Korean leader , Kim Jong @-@ un , to negotiate .
by participating in coordinated economic sanctions against the Kim regime , and by reportedly capping vital exports of oil and other essentials to the North , China has played its part in bringing Kim to the table .
on paper , the fundamental question is whether North Korea will be willing to abandon its nuclear @-@ weapons program , the fruit of more than 30 years of work .
and as China well knows , North Korea would never give up its nuclear weapons without major changes in the military balance on and around the Korean Peninsula .
Kim will likely offer to denuclearize solely on the condition that the US withdraw its forces from South Korea , and perhaps from Japan , too . barring that , he would not feel secure enough to do without the nuclear deterrence on which he has staked his regime &apos;s survival .
for his part , Trump could not possibly accede to such a condition . at best , he could agree on a process through which such extraordinary moves might be discussed at a later date .
either way , China comes out on top .
in the event of stalemate , it will have gotten Kim to the table and put America in the position of being a refusenik .
and if the US does agree to any military concessions , China &apos;s strategic position will be strengthened .
the only real question for Xi , then , is whether he wants to assert China &apos;s top @-@ dog status now , or sometime in the future .
China &apos;s Dream World
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - Ruling elites almost everywhere - whether in democracies or in authoritarian regimes - believe that clever sloganeering can inspire their people and legitimize their power .
there are , of course , crucial differences .
in functioning democracies , government leaders can be held accountable for their promises : the press can scrutinize their policies , opposition parties are motivated to show that the party in power lies and cheats .
as a result , incumbents are frequently forced to carry out at least some of their promises .
autocratic rulers , by contrast , face no such pressures .
press censorship , repression of dissent , and the absence of organized opposition allow rulers the luxury of promising whatever they want , with no political consequences for failing to deliver .
the result is government of the sloganeers , by the sloganeers , and for the sloganeers .
China appears to have perfected this form of government over the last decade .
the ruling Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) , in response to rising public demand for social justice , has devised numerous slogans , such as &quot; governing for the people , &quot; &quot; building a harmonious society , &quot; &quot; balanced development , &quot; &quot; scientific development , &quot; and so on .
whenever the top leadership in Beijing uttered such slogans , they became the rallying cry of the bureaucracy .
the party &apos;s massive propaganda machine went into overdrive and blanketed the country with a publicity blitz that would make the most extravagant Madison Avenue advertising campaign look like child &apos;s play .
but government by slogan , whether in China or in other autocracies , seldom achieves its declared goals .
in the last decade , GDP growth soared , but most indices of social justice , governance performance , and public welfare deteriorated .
macroeconomic imbalances worsened as economic growth became excessively dependent on investment and exports .
inequality worsened .
official corruption escalated .
social mobility declined .
environmental degradation reached a crisis point .
today , it is the responsibility of China &apos;s new leadership , headed by President Xi Jinping , to avert another decade of missed opportunities .
without missing a beat , Xi , like his predecessors , rolled out a new slogan to inspire popular confidence in his leadership .
as a catchphrase for his administration &apos;s objective , &quot; the great renaissance of the Chinese nation &quot; is bit long , but it has lately morphed into the simpler &quot; China Dream . &quot;
the substance of the China Dream remains difficult to determine .
when Xi first unveiled his slogan after being selected as the CCP &apos;s new general secretary , he defined it in simple , accessible , but nonetheless generic terms : the &quot; Chinese people dream of living the same good life as all other people in the world . &quot;
Xi has said little about the China Dream since - and his silence has caused considerable trouble .
China &apos;s ever @-@ zealous propaganda officials , evidently fearful of not demonstrating sufficient loyalty and respect for the new party chief , quickly hijacked the slogan ; the China Dream has replaced the &quot; China Model &quot; in official political branding .
whatever the new administration does is touted as part of its ambitious effort to make the &quot; China Dream &quot; come true .
unfortunately , China propagandists , who double as censors , have a perverse ability to discredit anything that they try to brand .
the China Dream is no exception .
so far , public reaction has ranged from puzzlement to derision .
after a decade of government by slogan , the Chinese public wants substance .
this presents Xi with a real challenge .
he has risen to the top by winning friends and allies inside the CCP .
now that he is the leader of a dynamic , diverse , and increasingly demanding society , he must gain popular support and confidence to maintain his credibility and become an effective politician .
the first thing that Xi should do is to articulate a clearer , more specific , and inspiring version of the China Dream , and stop letting the CCP &apos;s propaganda officials define it for him .
the China Dream may include all of the economic benefits and material comfort that ordinary Chinese desire , but it will not be complete without the human rights and dignity that citizens in civilized societies take for granted .
the second thing that Xi and his colleagues need to do is to follow up with specific policies and actions that can bolster the credibility of their declared goals .
political slogans , however high @-@ sounding , become stale when their purveyors fail to make good on their promises .
Xi may still be enjoying a honeymoon with the Chinese public , but it is likely to be a short one .
his predecessors had ten years to carry out real reforms and accomplished little , leaving the Chinese in no mood to endure another decade of government by shibboleth .
will China weaponize Social Media ?
Atlanta - Ever since the 2016 US presidential election , with its revelations about Russian meddling , European officials have been on the lookout for similar attacks .
but Europeans aren &apos;t the only ones paying attention .
so , too , are China &apos;s leaders , who are considering what they might learn from the Kremlin &apos;s successes .
for Chinese President Xi Jinping , maintaining domestic stability is a top priority , a point underscored by China &apos;s annual budget for internal security .
at well over $ 100 billion , the official number is low .
like defense outlays , the real number is much higher , owing to hidden spending , including on research and development .
for example , China is exploring how artificial intelligence ( AI ) and big data can be used to monitor everything from social media to credit @-@ card spending , and it plans to assign all citizens a social @-@ reliability rating to weed out potential troublemakers .
the regime &apos;s Orwellian strategy is focused squarely on social media and controlling not just what is said , but also how information flows into and around the country .
moreover , the authorities are bringing technology companies into line with tough new laws and cyber @-@ security investigations .
for Xi , the ease with which the Kremlin has manipulated Facebook and Twitter demonstrates the need for a tighter grip on China &apos;s own social @-@ media platforms .
the Chinese government is now requesting seats on the boards of companies such as WeChat , Weibo , and Tencent , and demanding access to their users &quot; personal data .
Chinese cyber spies are also studying Russia &apos;s success .
to be sure , Chinese hackers do not lack technical savvy .
they have launched cyberattacks against US presidential campaigns , expatriate Tibetan movements , and Uighur activists .
they have burrowed into Western think tanks and universities that study China .
they have even hacked into Western news outlets that published embarrassing stories about Chinese leaders &quot; wealth .
still , the Chinese may have something to learn from Russia &apos;s well @-@ choreographed online army of trolls and bots .
similarly , strategists at the People &apos;s Liberation Army ( PLA ) are likely poring over the Kremlin &apos;s handiwork to inform their own cyber @-@ war tactics .
Chinese strategic thinking about &quot; political warfare &quot; holds that an adversary &apos;s political , social , and economic institutions - particularly the media - should be targeted before a shooting war ever begins .
to that end , Russia &apos;s diffusion of bogus news and conspiracy theories through its state @-@ funded media outlets RT and Sputnik could prove instructive .
in addition to expanding China &apos;s cyber capabilities , Xi has also been developing China &apos;s soft power through economic , social , cultural , and media initiatives .
and although he has not yet coupled these programs with China &apos;s clandestine forces to launch the kind of audacious attack that roiled the 2016 presidential election , he clearly is establishing the means to do so .
recently , it was revealed that China has been conducting wide @-@ ranging influence operations in Australia , using official campus organizations to monitor Chinese college students , business associations to tout Chinese interests , and diplomats to police local Chinese @-@ language media .
late last year , an Australian senator was forced to resign over his alleged ties to a Chinese billionaire .
China is also expanding its global media presence .
by some estimates , the government is sinking some $ 7 billion into new media and broadcast outlets abroad every year .
its official news agency , Xinhua , has more than 170 bureaus around the world and publishes in eight languages .
China Central Television ( CCTV ) has more than 70 foreign bureaus and broadcasts to 171 countries in six languages .
China Radio International is the world &apos;s second @-@ largest radio broadcaster after the BBC , broadcasting in 64 languages from 32 foreign bureaus to 90 radio stations worldwide .
none of these organizations has yet to distinguish itself as a go @-@ to international news source .
but they have become a significant source of information for people in underserved regions such as the Middle East and Africa , where they purvey China &apos;s views and are building sympathetic audiences .
at the same time , China is purchasing &quot; native advertising &quot; in Australian , American , and European newspapers .
this allows China to place officially authored content about controversial issues - such as its militarized island @-@ building in the South China Sea - next to those publications &quot; editorial offerings .
Xi is also playing the long game , by approving investments in movies and other forms of mass entertainment to influence how global popular culture treats all things Chinese .
despite the Chinese government &apos;s recent clampdown on outbound capital flows , Chinese companies are still adding to their major stakes in Hollywood properties .
the Chinese conglomerate Dalien Wanda alone has some $ 10 billion in entertainment assets in the United States , Europe , and Australia .
and other Chinese Internet and financial giants such as Alibaba , Tencent , and Hony Capital , as well as state @-@ owned companies such as the China Film Group , have invested tens of billions of dollars in US film ventures .
with these financial stakes , the Chinese government has leverage that goes beyond old @-@ fashioned censorship .
Hollywood studio bosses with an eye on China &apos;s massive domestic market will be tempted to kowtow to the government &apos;s &quot; creative &quot; requests when it comes to scripts , casting decisions , and so forth .
at $ 8.6 billion in 2017 , Chinese box @-@ office receipts are second only to North America &apos;s .
yet China allows only 38 foreign films into the country each year , inducing filmmakers to bend over backward to please the censors .
of course , Hollywood executives aren &apos;t the only Westerners helping Xi &apos;s realize his agenda .
between Apple &apos;s recent decision to relinquish its Chinese user data storage to a Chinese partner and Google &apos;s announcement that it will site a new AI research center in China , US technology giants are not just making deals to benefit their &quot; stakeholders . &quot;
they are also handing Xi and his cyber operatives proprietary technologies and know @-@ how , and even potential access to US targets .
this raises an obvious question : if Russia could roil a US presidential election without such intimate business relationships , what will China be able to do in the years ahead ?
to think that China &apos;s only interest is making money , one Hollywood executive recently acknowledged , would be &quot; very naive and dangerous &quot; indeed .
Xi Jinping &apos;s Vision for Global Governance
new YORK - The contrast between the disarray in the West , on open display at the NATO summit and at last month &apos;s G7 meeting in Canada , and China &apos;s mounting international self @-@ confidence is growing clearer by the day .
last month , the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) concluded its Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs , the second since Xi Jinping became China &apos;s undisputed ruler in 2012 .
these meetings are not everyday affairs . they are the clearest expression of how the leadership sees China &apos;s place in the world , but they tell the world much about China as well .
the last such conference , in 2014 , marked the funeral of Deng Xiaoping &apos;s dictum of &quot; hide your strength , bide your time , never take the lead , &quot; and heralded a new era of international activism .
in part , this change reflected Xi &apos;s centralization of control , Chinese leaders &quot; conclusion that American power is in relative decline , and their view that China had become an indispensable global economic player .
since 2014 , China has expanded and consolidated its military position in the South China Sea .
it took the idea of the New Silk Road and turned it into a multi @-@ trillion @-@ dollar trade , investment , infrastructure , and wider geopolitical / geo @-@ economic initiative , engaging 73 different countries across much of Eurasia , Africa and beyond .
and China signed up most of the developed world to the first large @-@ scale non @-@ Bretton Woods multilateral development bank , the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank .
China has also launched diplomatic initiatives beyond its immediate sphere of strategic interest in East Asia , as well as actively participating in initiatives such as the 2015 Iran nuclear deal .
it has developed naval bases in Sri Lanka , Pakistan , and Djibouti , and participates in naval exercises with Russia as far away as the Mediterranean and the Baltic .
in March , China established its own international development agency .
the emergence of a coherent grand strategy ( regardless of whether the West chooses to recognize it as such ) is not all that has changed since 2014 .
for starters , the emphasis on the CPC &apos;s role is much stronger than before .
Xi , concerned that the party had become marginal to the country &apos;s major policy debates , has reasserted party control over state institutions and given precedence to political ideology over technocratic policymaking .
Xi is determined to defy the trend @-@ line of Western history , to see off Francis Fukuyama &apos;s &quot; end of history &quot; culminating in the general triumph of liberal democratic capitalism , and preserve a Leninist state for the long term .
this approach - known as &quot; Xi Jinping Thought &quot; - now suffuses China &apos;s foreign policy framework .
in particular , Xi &apos;s view that that there are identifiable immutable &quot; laws &quot; of historical development , both prescriptive and predictive , was particularly prominent at last month &apos;s foreign policy conference .
if this sounds like old @-@ fashioned dialectical materialism , that &apos;s because it is .
Xi embraces the Marxist @-@ Leninist tradition as his preferred intellectual framework .
given its emphasis on iron laws of political and economic development , a dialectical @-@ materialist worldview means that there is nothing random about world events .
so , Xi argues , if Marx &apos;s analytical framework is applied to the current period , it is clear that the global order is at a turning point , with the West &apos;s relative decline coinciding with the fortuitous national and international circumstances enabling China &apos;s rise .
in Xi &apos;s words , &quot; China has been in the best period of development since modern times , while the world is undergoing the most profound and unprecedented changes in a century . &quot;
of course , formidable obstacles lie ahead for China . but Xi has concluded that the obstacles facing the US and the West are greater .
how such thinking will now drive China &apos;s concrete foreign policy is anyone &apos;s guess .
but how one @-@ party states , particularly Marxist states , choose to &quot; ideate &quot; reality matters a great deal : it is how the system speaks to itself .
and Xi &apos;s message to China &apos;s foreign policy elite is one of great confidence .
specifically , the Central Conference called for the country &apos;s international policy institutions and personnel to embrace Xi &apos;s agenda .
here Xi seems to have the foreign ministry in his sights .
there is a strong ideological flavor to Xi &apos;s apparent frustration with the ministry &apos;s glacial approach to policy innovation .
China &apos;s diplomats were urged to bear in mind that they are first and foremost &quot; party cadres , &quot; suggesting that Xi is likely to push the foreign policy apparatus toward greater activism , to give full effect to his emerging global vision .
the biggest change to emerge from last month &apos;s conference concerns global governance .
in 2014 , Xi referred to an impending struggle for the future structure of the international order .
while he did not elaborate , much work has since been devoted to three inter @-@ related concepts : guoji zhixu ( the international order ) ; guoji xitong ( the international system ) , and quanqiu zhili ( global governance ) .
of course , these terms have different and overlapping meanings in English , too .
but , broadly speaking , in Chinese , the term &quot; international order &quot; refers to a combination of the United Nations , the Bretton Woods Institutions , the G20 , and other multilateral institutions ( which China accepts ) , as well as the US system of global alliances ( which China does not ) .
the term &quot; international system &quot; tends to refer to the first half of this international order : the complex web of multilateral institutions that operate under international treaty law and seek to govern the global commons on the basis of the principle of shared sovereignty .
and &quot; global governance &quot; denotes the actual performance of the &quot; international system &quot; so defined .
what is startlingly new about Xi &apos;s remarks at the Central Conference was his call for China now to &quot; lead the reform of the global governance system with the concepts of fairness and justice . &quot;
this is by far the most direct statement of China &apos;s intentions on this important question offered so far .
the world should buckle up and get ready for a new wave of Chinese international policy activism .
like much of the rest of the international community , China is acutely conscious of the dysfunctionality of much of the current multilateral system .
so Xi &apos;s wish to lead &quot; reform of the global governance system &quot; is no accident .
it reflects growing diplomatic activism in multilateral institutions , in order to reorient them in a direction more compatible with what China regards as its &quot; core national interests . &quot;
Xi has reminded China &apos;s international policy elite that the totality of China &apos;s future foreign policy direction , including the reform of global governance , must be driven by these core national interests .
in this context , China also wants a more &quot; multipolar &quot; international system .
this is code for a world in which the role of the United States and the West is substantially reduced .
the challenge for the rest of the international community is to define what type of global order we now want .
what do existing institutions like the European Union , the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , or the African Union want for the international rules @-@ based system for the future ?
what exactly does the US want , with or without Trump ?
and how will we collectively preserve the global values embodied in the UN Charter , the Bretton Woods institutions , and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights ?
the future of the global order is in a state of flux .
China has a clear script for the future .
it &apos;s time for the rest of the international community to develop one of its own .
this is an edited version of an address delivered to the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore .
Xi of Arabia
Beijing - Those who have criticized China &apos;s cautious foreign policy need to reconsider their position , following President Xi Jinping &apos;s just @-@ completed visit to Saudi Arabia and Iran - two major Middle Eastern powers that are currently at each other &apos;s throats .
the visits reflect the more active foreign @-@ policy approach that Xi has spearheaded , particularly in the Middle East .
this new approach raises an important question : can China &apos;s impact on the region be more constructive than that of the United States ?
now is certainly a tense time to become involved in the Middle East , a region where , as Richard N. Haass argues , a New Thirty Years &quot; War , in which &quot; civil wars and proxy wars become impossible to distinguish , &quot; is unfolding .
a key factor in unleashing the current chaos - which represents the convergence of numerous deep @-@ rooted challenges and conflicts - was America &apos;s 2003 invasion of Iraq .
by eliminating Saddam Hussein &apos;s Sunni regime , the US paved the way for a Shia @-@ led government , a development that tilted the regional balance of power toward Iran and left Sunni @-@ ruled Saudi Arabia feeling encircled by a Shia coalition .
that is why Iran and Saudi Arabia are so deeply involved in Syria &apos;s civil war .
they know that the fate of President Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s Alawite regime will have significant implications for the regional order .
for Saudi Arabia , reining in Iran is all the more important in the wake of the recent agreement on the country &apos;s nuclear program , which has resulted in the lifting of international economic sanctions that have long constrained Iran &apos;s regional leadership ambitions .
of course , neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran - or Turkey , which has also joined the competition for regional influence - is seeking a direct confrontation .
these countries would rather empower other actors , even if it means fueling dangerous religious radicalization and the privatization of violence .
the terrorist movements that have emerged as a result of this approach - namely , the Islamic State - cannot be defeated using traditional counter @-@ terrorism operations .
to be sure , these Middle East rivals are not the only ones involved in the region &apos;s current quagmire .
external powers like France , Russia , and , of course , the US are also deeply involved , each with its own geopolitical objectives .
now China is entering the fray , bringing a uniquely constructive vision with it .
the two characters that comprise the Chinese word for crisis ( 危机 ) mean , individually , &quot; danger &quot; ( 危 ) and &quot; opportunity &quot; ( 机 ) .
that is precisely what China sees in today &apos;s Middle East .
for most of the relevant actors , highly perilous geopolitical competition is overshadowing vast economic opportunities .
not for China .
as Xi put it on his recent visit to Cairo : &quot; instead of looking for a proxy in the Middle East , we promote peace talks ; instead of seeking any sphere of influence , we call on all parties to join the circle of friends for the Belt and Road initiative . &quot;
this reflects the broader foreign @-@ policy rebalancing that Xi has been pursuing since taking office in 2013 .
unlike the US , which has been engineering a strategic &quot; pivot &quot; from one geographic region to another , China is rebalancing from &quot; politics among nations &quot; to &quot; politics among networks , &quot; focusing on &quot; connectivity &quot; rather than &quot; control . &quot;
the Middle East is crucial to this connectivity @-@ oriented grand strategy , not least because of its key role in the &quot; One Belt , One Road &quot; project that Xi promoted in Cairo .
China &apos;s determination to reestablish the ancient Silk Roads - including the overland route that runs through the Middle East - has led it to enter into strategic partnerships with eight Arab countries in recent years , and to sign agreements with six Arab countries to pursue the initiative jointly .
Iran , Turkey , and seven Arab countries are among the founding members of the Beijing @-@ based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank , a key institution for financing related infrastructure projects .
but China is not waiting for the One Belt , One Road initiative to be completed before pursuing increased trade with Middle Eastern countries .
during his recent visit to Saudi Arabia , he claimed that free @-@ trade negotiations between the Gulf Cooperation Council and China should be concluded this year .
moreover , Xi announced that China will issue $ 55 billion in loans to the Middle East , including a $ 15 billion special loan for industrialization , $ 10 billion in commercial loans to boost production capacity , and $ 10 billion in concessional loans .
the remaining $ 20 billion will go toward a joint investment fund with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar to invest in traditional energy , infrastructure development , and high @-@ end manufacturing industries in the region .
all of this aligns with the &quot; 1 + 2 + 3 &quot; cooperation pattern that Xi proposed at the June 2014 Ministerial Conference of the China @-@ Arab States Cooperation Forum in Beijing .
according to this approach , energy cooperation should form the core of collaboration , while infrastructure construction and trade and investment form two wings . nuclear power , satellites , and new energy sources are three high @-@ tech areas where cooperation can lead to important breakthroughs .
here , the goal is to take advantage of the region &apos;s energy resources , while helping it to industrialize and diversify its economy .
of course , China &apos;s success in the Middle East requires progress on mitigating the region &apos;s tensions , cooling its hotspots , and stabilizing weak countries - all of which will require smart diplomacy by many actors .
but peace and development are inextricably linked .
to turn the tide against extremism , Middle Eastern countries must be able to provide economic opportunities to their people , and these can only be secured through trade , investment , and jobs .
in this fundamental respect , China has a lot to offer the Middle East - and President Xi has once again shown his determination to offer it .
China &apos;s Contradictions
new HAVEN - China &apos;s quinquennial Communist Party congresses are that rare event where ritual and dogma combine with introspection and strategy . the 19th National Congress , which began on October 18 , is no exception .
notwithstanding the suspense over potential changes in Party leadership , which typically occur at the end of the meeting , President Xi Jinping &apos;s political report , delivered on the opening day , was a high @-@ impact event .
significantly , it says as much about the Party as it does about Xi .
as Alice Miller , a leading sinologist at Stanford &apos;s Hoover Institution , emphasizes , the report was carefully crafted over a one @-@ year period to convey the consensus of the Party &apos;s highest organ , the 205 @-@ member Central Committee .
three conclusions from Xi &apos;s address are particularly important .
for starters , the ideological underpinnings of &quot; Xi Jinping Thought &quot; have been raised to the same lofty level as those of &quot; Mao Zedong Thought , &quot; effectively elevating Xi over his three predecessors - Hu Jintao , Jiang Zemin , and even the revered Deng Xiaoping .
much has been written about Xi &apos;s consolidation of power since he was appointed General Secretary in November 2012 . but this elevation makes it official .
after only five years in office , the Party leadership has anointed Xi as one of modern China &apos;s two greatest historic figures .
second , the political report speaks with great confidence about a China that has now entered a &quot; New Era . &quot; but by underscoring the Chinese adage that the ... &quot; last leg of a journey just marks the halfway point , &quot; Xi sketched an even more ambitious future .
China &apos;s sights are now set on two goals - completing the task of building the so @-@ called moderately prosperous society by 2035 , and then establishing its position as a Great Power by 2050 .
unlike China &apos;s goal @-@ setting exercises in the past , there are no quantitative targets attached to these &quot; twin centenary goals &quot; ( which roughly align with the Party &apos;s founding in 1921 and the establishment of the People &apos;s Republic of China in 1949 ) . they celebrate the long @-@ awaited national rejuvenation that Xi has dubbed the China Dream .
the third point is perhaps the most intriguing .
this is couched in the form of China &apos;s &quot; principal contradiction &quot; - a Marxist concept that serves as an admission of a fundamental problem requiring resolution .
the principal contradiction , while typically elliptical and ambiguous , frames a rich discussion of risks and opportunities , strategy and tactics , reforms and governance - all of which will shape China &apos;s prospects for the foreseeable future .
the big news is that , under Xi &apos;s leadership , the Party has revised its principal contradiction for the first time since 1981 . whereas the contradiction had previously been framed as a tradeoff between the needs of the people and China &apos;s &quot; backward social production , &quot; it is now viewed as a tension between &quot; unbalanced and inadequate development &quot; and the &quot; people &apos;s ever @-@ growing needs for a better life . &quot;
this restatement of the principal contradiction has not emerged from thin air .
it clearly signals a far @-@ reaching change in national perspective - from that of a poor developing country to that of an increasingly prosperous society focused on becoming a Great Power .
it is also consistent with the critique of former Premier Wen Jiabao , who in March 2007 famously warned of a Chinese economy that was becoming increasingly &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and &#91; ultimately &#93; unsustainable . &quot;
over the past ten years , two five @-@ year plans - the 12th , enacted in 2011 , and the 13th , enacted in 2016 - plus a major set of reforms adopted at the so @-@ called Third Plenum in 2013 , have aimed to resolve China &apos;s persistent and worrisome imbalances .
Xi &apos;s political report doesn &apos;t alter the main thrust of those efforts .
the real significance is that rebalancing is now enshrined within the Party &apos;s ideological underpinnings . it is a foundational pillar of Xi Jinping Thought .
the political report &apos;s focus on China &apos;s principal contradiction also raises important questions about what still may be missing from the Party &apos;s long @-@ term strategy .
three &quot; secondary contradictions &quot; are especially striking on the economic front .
first , there is ongoing tension between the role of the state and that of markets in guiding resource allocation .
this was a glaring contradiction of the 2013 Third Plenum reforms , which focused on the seemingly inconsistent combination of a &quot; decisive role &quot; for markets and steadfast support for state ownership .
the Party has long believed that these two features of economic life are compatible - the so @-@ called blended economy with Chinese characteristics .
Xi &apos;s political report praises the mixed ownership model and also aspires to an economy led by great firms with unmatched global competitive prowess . but it glosses over the thorny issue of state @-@ owned enterprise reform that may be required to resolve this contradiction and avoid the Japanese &quot; zombie &quot; problem of a chronic debt overhang .
second , there is the tension between supply and demand .
consistent with other recent pronouncements of senior Chinese officials , the political report leaves little doubt that supply @-@ side structural reforms are now the highest priority of economic policymakers .
the related emphasis on productivity , innovation , pruning excess capacity , and moving up the value chain in manufacturing and services are underscored as key building blocks of this effort .
at the same time , the report de @-@ emphasizes consumer spending and services - now buried deep in the list of priorities for a modernized economy .
yet focusing on supply without paying equal attention to the foundations of aggregate demand is a puzzling and potentially worrisome disconnect .
a final secondary tension can be found in the contrast between the path and the destination .
notwithstanding all the self @-@ congratulatory flourishes in Xi &apos;s political report , there is good reason to believe that the Chinese economy is only in the early stages of its long @-@ heralded structural transformation .
its services sector is growing rapidly , but is still embryonic , accounting for just 52 % of GDP .
and household consumption , which is also growing rapidly , is still less than 40 % of GDP .
China may well be on a path to a New Normal or a New Era .
but the final destination remains far down the road , with many contradictions to be resolved during the journey .
when Xi Meets Obama
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - As Chinese President Xi Jinping begins his trip to the United States in Seattle , home to many of the world &apos;s leading technology firms , most observers are looking ahead to his subsequent meeting with President Barack Obama .
can the summit reverse the downward spiral in US @-@ China relations that began with Xi &apos;s accession to power in 2013 ?
few dispute that the world &apos;s most important bilateral relationship is in deep trouble .
from the US perspective , China &apos;s reckless behavior in the South China Sea , unrestrained cyber attacks against American targets , protectionist economic policies , and escalating political repression at home have demolished the belief that a globally integrated China would be a responsible and cooperative partner .
indeed , recent Chinese actions directly challenge vital American interests and core values .
Chinese leaders , for their part , view America &apos;s strategic &quot; pivot to Asia &quot; as a thinly veiled step to tighten its geopolitical containment of China .
moreover , they have become obsessed with US dominance in international finance and technology and , most important , America &apos;s ideological commitment to liberal democracy , which they regard as an existential threat to the Chinese Communist Party ( CCP ) .
the toxic mix of mutual mistrust and tit @-@ for @-@ tat behavior has brought Sino @-@ American ties to their lowest point since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 .
there is now widespread concern that the US and China may be headed for a new cold war .
for Xi , the stakes of his US trip could not be higher .
to maintain his domestic image as a strong leader , he must stick to his nationalist rhetoric and policies .
but he also needs to stabilize the all @-@ important relationship with the US .
judging by recent moves by China and the US , we can expect modest success in a few contentious areas .
while such improvements , on their own , will not change the relationship &apos;s adversarial dynamic , they may halt the deterioration in bilateral ties , at least for now .
on the eve of the summit , both the US and China took positive , albeit symbolic , steps to demonstrate their goodwill and improve the diplomatic atmosphere .
the US extradited a low @-@ level Chinese official to face corruption charges .
the Obama administration also decided not to announce sanctions against Chinese entities and individuals allegedly involved in cyber attacks on American companies and government agencies .
for its part , China released a human @-@ rights activist and dispatched a high @-@ level delegation to the US to discuss cyber security .
in fact , the two sides are reportedly negotiating a landmark deal that would prohibit cyber attacks against each other &apos;s vital infrastructure .
an agreement on the issue could be the most important outcome of the summit , although other types of cyber attacks are unlikely to be covered by it .
for China , the biggest prize is a bilateral investment treaty ( BIT ) .
in practical terms , a US @-@ China BIT would make it easier for Chinese entities to invest and operate in the US and increase American firms &quot; access to Chinese markets .
such a deal would be a near @-@ term boon for Xi , because it would represent a vote of confidence by the US in China &apos;s struggling economy .
but the prospects for a BIT are uncertain , at best .
the US Congress is deeply skeptical , and the American business community needs convincing as well .
both have been bitterly disappointed by China &apos;s mercantilist trading policies after its accession to the World Trade Organization .
given how many contentious issues remain unresolved , an accord is unlikely during the summit .
the South China Sea dispute may prove to be the toughest diplomatic nut to crack .
China has staked its national prestige and its leadership &apos;s nationalist credentials on this issue , which means that Xi is likely to rebuff US demands that China cease all activities seen as militarizing its new artificial islands in disputed waters .
the most that can be realistically expected is an insipid statement of the two sides &quot; agreement to disagree .
but the most politically sensitive topic for China has little to do with cyber security or the South China Sea . it is China &apos;s ongoing crackdown on civil liberties and human rights .
facing enormous domestic pressure , Obama has announced that human rights will be on the agenda of his summit with Xi .
but Xi is unlikely to make any concessions , because doing so could damage his political standing within the CCP and undermine a central component of his political vision : the reassertion of political control over a dynamic society .
ultimately , the key question looming over the summit is whether Xi will be able to offer enough to repair the damage done to Sino @-@ US relations in recent years .
to be sure , trying is better than doing nothing .
but what really matters is whether , after the summit , China takes concrete actions that reflect a genuine shift from the policies that have fueled the deterioration in bilateral ties .
the Sino @-@ American Employment Challenge
Hong KONG - Donald Trump &apos;s rise to power in the United States involved more than a little China @-@ bashing .
yet , with Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s visit to Trump &apos;s Florida estate earlier this month , it seems that the status quo in the bilateral relationship - crucial for global trade , growth , and stability - will be maintained .
that could be very good news for Chinese and US workers alike .
at the summit , Xi reiterated China &apos;s commitment to maintaining a positive relationship with the US .
&quot; we have a thousand reasons to get China @-@ US relations right , &quot; he said , &quot; and not one reason to spoil &quot; them .
Trump , for his part , accepted Xi &apos;s invitation to visit China soon .
on trade , Trump and Xi agreed to a 100 @-@ day plan for discussions on reducing the US trade deficit with China .
moreover , the US accepted China &apos;s proposal to revamp the framework for bilateral engagement by creating the US @-@ China Comprehensive Dialogue , consisting of four sub @-@ dialogues : diplomacy and security , economic issues , law enforcement and cybersecurity , and social and cultural affairs .
the understanding between Xi and Trump reflected a sober acknowledgement of the domestic and international risks their countries face .
both seemed to recognize that a stable US @-@ China relationship is necessary to enable them to focus on their respective challenges .
for Xi , those challenges include supply @-@ side structural reforms to address corruption , pollution , rising debt , overcapacity , and low productivity .
as for Trump , the main imperative is to overcome political and institutional obstacles to fulfilling his promises , including to reduce taxes and invest in infrastructure .
but there is one key challenge that both leaders have in common : jobs .
technological advances , especially in automation and robotics , are putting a growing number of jobs under pressure .
in the US , that pressure was a driving force behind Trump &apos;s election ( though it was often and disproportionately blamed on immigrants and developing @-@ country exporters , including China ) .
but in China , too , technology @-@ driven job insecurity could pose a threat to political stability .
according to a report released by US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration last year , anywhere from 9 % to 47 % of jobs will be threatened by automation during the coming decade .
more recently , McKinsey released its own report on the topic , in which it estimates that about 60 % of all occupations could undergo automation of 30 % or more of their constituent activities .
now , world leaders - beginning with Trump and Xi - must figure out how to sustain employment , as existing jobs disappear .
the Obama administration &apos;s study recommended a three @-@ pronged approach : investment in artificial intelligence ( to take advantage of its benefits ) ; education and training of workers for the jobs of the future ; and aid for workers in transition .
this is all well and good , but one imperative is missing : ensuring that enough new jobs actually are created .
in both the China and the US , job disruptions are subject to sectoral and geographic imbalances .
driverless cars , for example , will threaten some 2 @-@ 3 million jobs in the US .
those job losses will hit workers in some sectors - beginning with personal and freight transport - particularly hard .
similarly , the effects of automation on factory workers tend to be concentrated in particular regions .
America &apos;s Rust Belt , which once boasted a powerful manufacturing sector , is already suffering the consequences of automation .
in China , it is the northeastern region that is being hit hardest by job losses , owing to overcapacity and the closure of polluting and loss @-@ making heavy industries .
but the most consequential asymmetry affecting the job @-@ creation challenge may be the one between institutions and policies .
sharp increases in government employment are usually fiscally unsustainable and even counterproductive , as they can crowd out the private sector .
yet large enterprises - whether private or state @-@ owned - are in job @-@ reduction mode , driven either by profit or efficiency pressures .
this leaves small and medium @-@ size enterprises ( SMEs ) to pick up the slack .
China &apos;s SMEs are certainly capable of doing so .
indeed , even if large enterprises were not currently shedding workers , they would be at a disadvantage vis @-@ à @-@ vis more efficient and innovative SMEs in an economy transformed by interactive Internet platforms .
consider e @-@ commerce .
as a recent report by the Alibaba Research Institute points out , e @-@ commerce is transforming the relationship between customers and businesses .
what was once a business @-@ to @-@ consumer supply @-@ and @-@ distribution model has become far more interactive , with customers constantly delivering feedback to which businesses must constantly adapt .
large Internet platforms like Alibaba can use Big Data and smart analytics to monitor such changes .
but large established firms cannot respond to those changes - say , by adjusting what they are producing or how they are distributing it - with the same speed and flexibility as their SME counterparts .
despite the potential of SMEs to produce valuable innovation and create jobs , however , the sector has been woefully neglected by policymakers .
for example , tax incentives do not account for SMEs &quot; positive externalities in terms of job creation and innovation .
and , because of the risks of individual failures , SMEs often face higher costs for bank credit , particularly in China .
as the world &apos;s two largest consumer markets and leading trade partners , China and the US can do much to help each other overcome the barriers to increased , broad @-@ based , and high @-@ quality job creation .
the US has the technology , talent , and regulatory experience to continue to lead the way on innovation , supporting job creation in new and future @-@ oriented industries and activities .
and China &apos;s move toward a consumption @-@ led economy , driven by an increasingly modern services sector , is likely to boost demand for high @-@ quality and innovative US goods and services .
the result would be a much more balanced trade relationship and , potentially , a new global partnership for development .
with that in mind , one can only hope that Trump maintains the cooperative spirit demonstrated at the recent Florida summit .
why Work at Work ?
Phuket - Marissa Mayer , the new CEO of Yahoo ! , recently created a fuss by issuing an edict that forbids anyone at the company to work from home .
Mayer &apos;s demarche received a lot of press coverage , probably more than it deserved .
that may not be so surprising : she is a woman , and she allegedly has a nursery for her baby next door to her office .
above all , people seemed to react to the categorical nature of her decision ( why everyone ? ) and to the irony that Yahoo ! is a tech company ( don &apos;t they know about Skype ? ) .
I think that Mayer made the right decision , and I am sure that over time exceptions to her order will be allowed at managers &quot; discretion .
but , until now , the &quot; right &quot; to work at home was sacrosanct at Yahoo ! , something that an employee &apos;s manager could not overrule .
and , by all accounts , enough people at Yahoo ! were not working , either from home or from more interesting places , that it had become a serious problem .
beyond that , Mayer &apos;s edict makes more sense as a means of cultural change within a business than it does as a way to improve any particular individual &apos;s productivity .
almost precisely because working remotely is easy , the advantage that a workplace has over a collection of home workers - or a set of outsourced workers assembled through Task rabbit - is that people can accomplish more in a setting that provides a common culture and the benefit of serendipitous connections .
long ago , the advantage of a firm was that it lowered transaction costs ( an idea first clearly expressed by the Nobel laureate economist Ronald Coase ) , such as the costs of finding workers , assigning them to tasks , assessing productivity , and setting salaries .
now that transaction costs are so low , the primary benefit of working at work is that the physical interactions foster an organizational culture and boost creativity , rather than efficiency or productivity , within an established routine .
Mayer , I think , did not order her employees back to the office merely because some people were not actually working at home ; rather , many of those who were working were not working together .
to be sure , it seems contradictory to some people that Yahoo ! , an online business , requires its employees to be physically present in the company &apos;s offices .
but most of the money and talent in this industry already seem to concentrate physically in one small part of the United States , between San Francisco and San Jose .
whether it &apos;s the Yahoo ! cafeteria ( now more inviting and more frequented with the advent of free food ) , or the halls of the plug &amp; Play startup accelerator , proximity matters .
being physically present at work means direct contact with other sharp and creative minds .
and the benefits of human contact and interaction are why salespeople still call on customers instead of using Skype , and why Meetup ( which supports organizers of face @-@ to @-@ face meetings ; I am on the company &apos;s board ) changes lives in ways that Twitter and Facebook rarely do .
of course , those who prefer to work at home cite not just the cost and time of commuting , but also the proliferation of meetings - too much culture , perhaps - and a steady flood of communication that simply interrupts their work rather than enhancing it .
interestingly , I heard this point at a WPP Stream &quot; unconference &quot; in Phuket , Thailand , where a couple of hundred people had flown thousands of miles to meet face to face to share ideas and strengthen working relationships .
so , yes , online work can make a lot of sense in many situations , but when you are trying to fix a broken corporate culture , you need the commitment , human engagement , and creative interaction that happen most consistently in a physical workplace .
in the end , it is up to good managers to decide who can work where , and to make meetings short and useful .
indeed , the whole point of having managers is that they are supposed to exercise judgment .
otherwise , computers and the Internet would allow us not just to work from home , but to report to a software program rather than to a person .
but , in the end , the challenge is to find the right fit between people and environment .
personally , I come at this from the opposite direction .
as an independent angel investor with no real day job , I don &apos;t have an office to report to every day .
but I would miss the companionship of people working around me - even if they do not necessarily work with me .
fortunately , Meetup allows me to sit at a desk amid its roughly 90 people ; I travel a lot , but I work from a desk at Meetup whenever I am at &quot; home &quot; in New York City .
true , I don &apos;t have to go to the company &apos;s meetings , but I like being surrounded by busy people ; I know it makes me work harder .
whatever our work , we remain physically social beings .
Yankee bases Go Home
Rio DE JANEIRO - Last month , the leaders of all 12 countries of South America ( except one ) gathered in Quito , Ecuador &apos;s capital , for the summit of the Union of South American Nations .
Unasur or UNASUL ( depending on whether one speaks Spanish or Portuguese ) was established by the twelve presidents in Brasília in May 2008 with the aim of furthering economic and political integration .
instead , Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez hijacked the Quito meeting to propagate his Bolivarian Revolution and expound his own ideas for the continent &apos;s future as independent of the United States .
thanks to America &apos;s recently announced military agreement with Colombia , Chávez &apos;s ideas got more of a hearing than might have been expected . for , instead of infrastructure plans , commercial or environmental treaties , or even multilateral action against such common problems as violence and poverty , the issue that dominated both press accounts and the speeches at the gathering was the new US @-@ Colombian military agreement , announced less than a month before the summit .
to no one &apos;s surprise , Chávez dominated the criticism of the pact .
he claimed that the &quot; winds of war are blowing , &quot; and that the announcement of the military agreement &quot; can transform itself into a tragedy . &quot;
unfortunately , Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was absent from the meeting .
Colombia and Ecuador broke diplomatic relations in March 2008 , after Colombia &apos;s army pursued FARC guerillas , who have been fighting Colombia &apos;s government for decades , into Ecuadorean territory .
so Uribe could not defend the new military agreement .
this left the floor open to Chávez to isolate Colombia and preach against the US .
in a continent where anti @-@ Americanism remains both very popular and an effective way to consolidate national cohesion and political power , Chávez &apos;s attacks found a ready audience .
in addition , Uribe &apos;s absence allowed Chávez to avoid responding to Colombia &apos;s accusations that Venezuela and its ally Ecuador support the narco @-@ Marxist FARC .
one week after the summit , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to calm the continent &apos;s fears about the US @-@ Colombia agreement , explaining that it is merely a minor revision of the Bill Clinton @-@ era Plan Colombia , an American program to support the government against the drug cartels .
but her words did little soothing .
nor did it seem to help that even most local military analysts say that the agreement does not represent any major change in the US military position on the continent .
the simple fact is that the timing of the announcement of the pact was terrible , and gave a platform for Bolivarian rants that will not be without consequences .
indeed , the ongoing fallout is likely to remain very negative .
by raising anti @-@ American suspicions and strengthening Chávez &apos;s position across the continent , the agreement weakens the influence of Brazil .
recently , Brazil had been differentiating itself from the rest of the continent through its stable economy and vibrant democratic political system , both of which were helping the country &apos;s poor .
so the spread and strengthening of Chávez &apos;s so @-@ called Bolivarian Revolution was not in Brazil &apos;s interests , even though some of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva &apos;s officials appear to be fans of Chávez and his administration .
the terrible timing of the US @-@ Colombia military agreement also gave Chávez and his allies a reason to build up their armies against the &quot; evil imperialist ianque . &quot;
after all , one must remember , the Bolivarian Revolution &apos;s supposed &quot; enemy � � is the US , and no one else .
so the agreement may legitimize and produce an arms race in South America , which is in no one &apos;s interest .
another unexpected consequence of the US @-@ Colombia military agreement may be a further heightening of tensions between Venezuela and Colombia .
the radical polarization of the Andean region between those two countries will create difficulties in building regional consensus and security problems in the Amazon , as well as weakening the Brazilian project for South American political and economic integration .
finally , another major consequence of the US @-@ Colombia deal are the doubts that it has created in Latin America about President Barack Obama &apos;s administration , and about the future of relations between the US and South America , especially Brazil , the main regional power .
the agreement revived the perception that US diplomacy lacks sensitivity where the region is concerned .
if Obama wants to encourage moderate and democratic politics in South America , and to bolster Brazil &apos;s efforts to foster stability and economic progress against the region &apos;s radical and undemocratic forces , it must take greater care in not appearing to undermine those the US claims to support .
for Chávez is showing that the old cry of &quot; Yankee go home &quot; still resonates .
the periphery &apos;s purgatory
Athens - German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s upcoming visit to Athens will be a far less tense affair than her earlier journeys here during Europe &apos;s long financial crisis .
of course , Greeks have little love for Merkel ; but , thanks to Europe &apos;s modest economic recovery , some of the poison has been drawn from Germany &apos;s relations with Europe &apos;s most damaged and distressed economies .
indeed , Europe is no longer considered a risk to global financial stability .
the eurozone &apos;s core economies are showing signs of revival , and financial conditions in the over @-@ indebted periphery are improving as well .
but , given capital shortages , depressed demand , and the slow pace of reform in the eurozone periphery , continued progress is far from certain .
in the eurozone economies that were hit hardest by the global economic crisis , the output and employment losses have been huge and persistent .
real ( inflation @-@ adjusted ) per capita income in the eurozone as a whole hovers around its 2007 level ; in Greece and Italy , however , it has sunk to the levels recorded in 2000 and 1997 , respectively .
meanwhile , the eurozone &apos;s overall unemployment rate is 12 % , and it is much higher in the periphery .
in Spain , more than 25 % of the labor force is jobless , while Italy &apos;s youth unemployment rate stands at 42 % .
in Greece , where the overall unemployment rate has climbed to 28 % , some 60 % of the country &apos;s young people are unemployed .
recovering from such crippling employment losses will not be easy , and will require a speedy return to high and sustainable growth rates .
consider Greece , where the government is planning a return to the capital markets in the coming months to finance the country &apos;s long @-@ term borrowing needs , even though securing such financing would require paying unsustainably high interest rates .
the fact that the government seems willing to do so translates clearly its desire to move beyond the influence of the &quot; troika &quot; ( the International Monetary Fund , the European Commission , and the European Central Bank ) .
indeed , since 2008 , Greece &apos;s GDP has shrunk by almost 25 % .
recovering lost capacity will require large amounts of capital , but there are five reasons why such financing is unlikely , under present conditions , to be forthcoming :
· As a result of austerity , public investment as a share of GDP continues to fall and has now reached a record low .
having already committed substantial rescue funds , eurozone authorities do not seem inclined to inject fresh capital .
· Sources of domestic private capital are limited , because the recession and the related near @-@ collapse of asset prices , along with a sharp increase in taxation - particularly on high incomes and on capital - significantly weakened balance sheets .
· Bank lending has slowed drastically , as a result of Greek banks effectively defaulting in the wake of the troika @-@ imposed losses on sovereign creditors and the nationalization of the country &apos;s banks .
a record @-@ low level of deposits and the recession @-@ related rise of non @-@ performing loans have weakened Greek banks &quot; capital position further .
( today , companies in the eurozone periphery borrow at substantially higher rates than their counterparts in the core .
for bank loans , the ratio is almost two to one ; for long @-@ term financing , it may reach as high as ten to one . )
· Greece &apos;s unsustainable debt position is discouraging foreign private investment .
the assumptions about primary surpluses , private @-@ sector involvement , and GDP growth underlying the government &apos;s commitment to reduce its debt level , which currently exceeds 170 % of GDP , to 124 % of GDP by 2020 cannot be realized , given Germany &apos;s opposition to restructuring the official financing that replaced the defaulted private loans .
some easing of loan conditionality - via extended maturities and reduced interest rates ‒ will be agreed later this year , but it will not be enough to calm fears of a new default .
· Trust between foreign and Greek investors is lacking , and it will not be restored until debt sustainability is achieved .
but Germany and the other core eurozone countries consistently block any proposal that contemplates debt mutualization or fiscal union .
ideas such as Eurobonds , a single European finance ministry , and increased capitalization of Europe &apos;s common rescue funds ( the European Stability Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism ) are not even being contemplated .
along with inadequate capital supply , Greece is suffering from a demand shortfall , as the troika continues to squeeze the country with harsh austerity .
if these policies are not relaxed or offset by more expansionary policies in the eurozone core , demand will remain depressed , discouraging further investment .
finally , on the reform front , time is running out .
for the last few years , rather than confronting the special interests - state @-@ protected businesses , public @-@ sector trade unions , and lobbies - that inhibit reform , Greece has spread its economic misery horizontally through blanket spending cuts .
reforms such as privatizing state @-@ owned enterprises , opening up closed professions , abolishing restrictive business practices , and reducing the size of the public sector have been undertaken very slowly and inefficiently , and they will not significantly alter growth prospects .
as it stands , Greece is unlikely to meet the recovery challenge - and other peripheral economies will probably falter , too .
sufficient reforms and capital are lacking , while the social rifts resulting from austerity increase the risk of potentially devastating political instability .
with the European Parliament election approaching , the prospect of populist anti @-@ austerity parties prevailing in the periphery - and of anti @-@ euro , anti @-@ bailout parties gaining power in the core - heightens the risk of instability even more .
should financial turbulence return and herald a new eurozone crisis , the monetary union &apos;s sustainability will again be called into question .
to prevent this outcome , Greece and the eurozone &apos;s other peripheral economies must limit austerity , buttress demand , undertake reform , increase investment support , and pursue fiscal union .
unfortunately , these keys to ensuring a cohesive and prosperous eurozone are likely to be left unturned - until , perhaps , the next crisis occurs .
China &apos;s Singapore Swing
Beijing - The Chinese Communist Party has released the final document of the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee .
in the CCP &apos;s history , the third plenum has traditionally been the occasion for the party to announce its major policies for the next 5 @-@ 10 years .
this year happened to be one of leadership transition , so the third plenum became more important .
as expected , its final document unveils a plan for comprehensive reforms that will reshape China &apos;s economy and society in the next decade .
for starters , the household registration ( hukou ) system will be reformed .
small cities and towns will allow migrants to apply for the local hukou with no strings attached , and medium @-@ size cities will do the same , with some restrictions .
although large cities will remain as closed as ever , the new policy will dramatically weaken the institutional foundation of China &apos;s long history of urban @-@ rural and regional divides .
similarly , the one @-@ child policy that has been enforced for the last 34 years will be modified .
in most provinces , parents who are both single children themselves already can have two children .
the new policy recommends that provinces allow couples to have two children if either parent is a single child .
while this will affect only around 10 million couples - a small number in a country of more than 1.3 billion people - the reform represents a gigantic step toward ending the one @-@ child rule .
farmers , moreover , will be granted the right to sell their residential land on the open market and will be much more likely to be compensated at market rates when their land is taken by the government .
state @-@ owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , meanwhile , are expected to surrender more of their profits to the government - up to 30 % by 2020 .
this extra revenue will be used to finance China &apos;s social @-@ security system .
indeed , from now on , the central government will take over social @-@ security expenditure , establishing nationally unified pension and health @-@ insurance systems , while the retirement age will be raised gradually .
currently , women can retire at the age of 50 , and men at 55 - ridiculously low by global standards and clearly unsustainable , given China &apos;s rapidly aging population .
SOEs &quot; power will be curtailed in other ways .
their ability to stifle innovation will be weakened by a drastic reduction in the government &apos;s power to restrict the entry of new competitors into all areas of the economy , as well as a major effort to reduce bureaucratic red tape .
financial liberalization , too , will be deepened , which will help startups and private firms most of all .
in addition to pledging to liberalize exchange and interest rates , the final document also calls for allowing domestic private capital to form small and medium @-@ size banks .
and , in an effort to bring coherence to commercial courts &quot; rulings , the court system will be directly financed by the central government , rather than by the corresponding local government .
this promises to strengthen the independence of the court system at the local level .
all of these reforms have long been expected .
but the third plenum also provided surprises , including the creation of a leading group within the CCP to steer reform .
China used to have a reform commission within the executive branch ; the establishment of the leading group indicates the CCP &apos;s commitment , and that of President Xi Jinping , to comprehensive reform .
a second surprise is the document &apos;s emphasis on the market .
in the past , government direction was emphasized , despite an acknowledgement of the market &apos;s positive role .
now , for the first time , the CCP is officially calling for &quot; allowing the market to take a central role in resource allocation . &quot;
a final surprise is that the document sets a timeframe to complete all of the reforms ; by 2020 , China is supposed to become a full @-@ fledged market economy .
this is the first time in recent history that the CCP has set a specific deadline for policymaking .
and yet , while all of these measures are encouraging signs , some key items are missing .
for example , there was no clear mention of further SOE reform .
likewise , though the document calls for strengthening local legislatures , it proposes no concrete plan to curb local governments &quot; role in economic activities , which is one of the sources of distortions in the Chinese economy .
this is related to the final document &apos;s most significant lacuna : political reform .
in fact , a Singapore @-@ style approach - combining a freewheeling market economy and an authoritarian regime - has clearly emerged from the plenum .
it is an approach that awaits the test of time .
Singapore is a city @-@ state of five million people - roughly the population of the Haidian district of Beijing .
given China &apos;s much greater size and complexity , the Chinese government &apos;s pursuit of the Singaporean model , with its suppression of any and all social disorder , would ultimately undermine economic dynamism .
to build the innovative economy envisioned by the third plenum , the CCP &apos;s leadership needs to find a new governance model that fosters a vibrant society .
sooner rather than later , the crucially important economic reforms that have just been unveiled will not be enough .
China &apos;s Real @-@ Estate Wrongs
Beijing - China &apos;s real @-@ estate sector has been a source of serious concern for several years , with soaring property prices raising fears of overheating in the housing market .
but , with price growth easing , it seems that the government &apos;s campaign to rein in property risk is finally taking hold .
the danger now is that the housing market will collapse - bringing China &apos;s economic prospects down with it .
in its effort to control rising housing prices , China &apos;s government has pursued nine distinct policies , not all of which have served their purpose .
though policies like limits on mortgages for first @-@ time buyers and minimum residency requirements for purchasing property in a first @-@ tier city like Beijing or Shanghai helped to ease demand , supply @-@ side tactics , such as limiting credit to real @-@ estate developers and imposing new taxes on property sales , have proved to be counter @-@ productive .
this flawed approach allowed China &apos;s housing prices to continue to rise steadily , fueling major housing bubbles , especially in first @-@ tier cities .
the average Beijing resident would have to save all of his or her income for 34 years before to be able to purchase an apartment outright .
in Shanghai and Guangzhou , the equivalent is 29 and 27 years , respectively - much higher than in other major international cities .
the expectation that this trend will continue has driven homeowners to retain possession of their properties , even though rental rates amount to less than 2 % of a property &apos;s market value .
but , with the real @-@ estate sector finally facing a downturn , the time to rethink this investment strategy has arrived .
in the first four months of 2014 , housing sales dropped by nearly 7 % year on year , with construction of new floor area falling by more than 22 % .
as a result , downward pressure on property prices is mounting .
in normal times , citizens and officials alike would welcome this trend .
but , at a time of weakening economic performance , China cannot afford an implosion of the real @-@ estate sector , which accounts for at least 30 % of overall growth .
indeed , though China &apos;s government has expressed its willingness to sacrifice some growth in its pursuit of structural reform and rebalancing , the impact of a housing @-@ market collapse on the financial sector would cause growth to slow beyond the acceptable limit .
that impact partly reflects the highly problematic nature of the Chinese government &apos;s long @-@ awaited move to liberalize interest rates .
instead of taking a direct approach - lifting the interest @-@ rate cap imposed on banks - liberalization has been achieved by allowing shadow banking to flourish .
as a result , a large number of nonbank financial institutions - such as wealth @-@ management companies and online financial @-@ services providers - are now using promises of high returns to attract small investors .
making matters worse , the monetary authorities have tightened the credit supply , in an effort to deleverage the Chinese economy .
while both interest @-@ rate liberalization and deleveraging are critical to the long @-@ term health of China &apos;s economy , the skyrocketing cost of borrowing is forcing many low @-@ risk companies , which are unable to offer sufficiently high rates of return , out of the market .
at the same time , real @-@ estate developers who have borrowed heavily from shadow @-@ banking institutions , based on the assumption that property prices would continue to rise steadily , may struggle to repay their debts , with a sharp decline in prices inevitably leading to defaults .
given that the formal banking sector provides a large share of shadow @-@ banking finance , this could initiate a chain reaction affecting the entire financial sector .
many remain convinced that China &apos;s government - which wields with the world &apos;s largest foreign @-@ exchange reserves and virtually unchecked authority - would be able to prevent a major financial crisis .
but the financial crisis in the fast @-@ growing city of Wenzhou , triggered by bad loans , suggests otherwise - not least because the economy has yet to recover fully .
there is no reason to believe that a similar crisis could not occur on a national scale .
to avoid such an outcome , China &apos;s leaders must urgently adopt counter @-@ cyclical measures .
they should begin by eliminating non @-@ market @-@ based restrictions on the real @-@ estate sector , which have generated serious distortions not only to the economy , but also to people &apos;s lives , with couples divorcing temporarily to gain the right to purchase an additional apartment .
when it comes to the real @-@ estate sector , China &apos;s government has consistently had the right objective and the wrong strategy .
it is time to align intention with action .
otherwise , China &apos;s financial sector - indeed , its entire economy - will suffer .
in Praise of China &apos;s New Normal
Beijing - China &apos;s economy is , at long last , undergoing a rebalancing , with growth rates having declined from more than 10 % before 2008 to roughly 7.5 % today .
is this China &apos;s &quot; new normal , &quot; or should the country anticipate even slower growth in the coming decade ?
China &apos;s rebalancing is apparent , first and foremost , in the export sector .
export growth has slowed from its 2001 @-@ 2008 average of 29 % annually to below 10 % , making foreign demand a far less critical engine of growth .
moreover , manufacturing employment and output , as a share of the total , began to decline last year .
in fact , in the first half of this year , services accounted for more than half of total economic growth .
it is no surprise , then , that China &apos;s current @-@ account surplus has shrunk rapidly , from its 2007 peak of more than 10 % of GDP to about 2 % of GDP today .
this rebalancing has helped to improve China &apos;s income distribution .
indeed , in recent years , labor &apos;s share of national income has been on the rise - a direct reflection of the decline in manufacturing and expansion in services .
that has meant greater regional balance as well : the coastal provinces , which produce more than 85 % of the country &apos;s exports , are experiencing the most pronounced slowdown , while inland provinces have maintained relatively high growth rates .
as a result , China &apos;s Gini coefficient ( a 100 @-@ point index of inequality , in which zero signifies absolute equality and one absolute inequality ) fell to 0.50 in 2012 , from 0.52 in 2010 .
two principal factors are driving this shift .
the first is the decline in global demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis , which has forced China to adjust its growth model sooner than anticipated .
the second is China &apos;s ongoing demographic transformation .
the share of working @-@ age people ( 16 @-@ 65 years old ) in the total population has been declining since its 2010 peak of 72 % .
and the absolute number of working @-@ age people has been falling since 2012 .
at the same time , China is undergoing rapid urbanization , with some 200 million people having left the agricultural sector in 2001 @-@ 2008 to seek urban manufacturing jobs .
more recently , however , the pace of migration has slowed substantially , with rural areas retaining 35 % of China &apos;s total labor force .
all of this implies lower growth rates for China - though perhaps not as low as the 6 @-@ 7 % rates that economists like Liu Shijing and Cai Fang are predicting for the next decade .
in fact , relying on China &apos;s past growth record to predict future performance is inherently problematic , owing not only to important shifts in the labor force , but also to the fact that the speed and scale of China &apos;s pre @-@ 2008 growth was unprecedented .
for starters , it is likely that the contribution to output growth of the rising ratio of working @-@ age people prior to 2010 was overestimated .
that makes the subsequent decline in the ratio an inaccurate measure with which to determine the negative impact on economic performance .
moreover , this approach neglects the educational dividends that China will enjoy over the next 20 years , as the younger generation replaces older workers .
as it stands , the rate of return @-@ adjusted educational attainment for Chinese aged 50 @-@ 60 is half that of those aged 20 @-@ 25 . in other words , young workers will be twice as productive as those entering retirement .
indeed , the level of educational attainment in China continues to improve .
by 2020 , the share of those aged 18 @-@ 22 who are pursuing a college education will reach 40 % , compared to 32 % today .
this improvement in human capital is bound to offset , to some extent , the net loss of labor .
furthermore , China &apos;s low retirement age - 50 for women and 60 for men - provides policymakers with considerable room to maneuver .
increasing the retirement age by just a half @-@ year for each of the next ten years would more than compensate for the annual decline in the labor force , which is projected to be 2.5 million workers during this period .
other trends are boosting China &apos;s prospects further .
though investment is likely to decline as a share of GDP , it will probably take a decade for it to dip below 40 % - still robust by international standards .
meanwhile , the capital stock can maintain a reasonable growth rate .
finally , China &apos;s capacity for innovation is improving steadily , owing to rapidly increasing human capital and rising investment in research and development .
by next year , Chinese R &amp; D expenditure , at 2.2 % of GDP , will be closing in on advanced @-@ country levels .
based on these trends - and assuming a constant labor @-@ participation rate - China &apos;s potential growth rate over the next decade is likely to hover around 6.9 @-@ 7.6 % , averaging 7.27 % .
this may be much lower than the 9.4 % average growth rate in 1988 @-@ 2013 , but it is more than adequate by global standards .
if this is China &apos;s &quot; new normal , &quot; it would still be the envy of the rest of the world .
China &apos;s Shadow Menace
Beijing - The US Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to exit from so @-@ called &quot; quantitative easing &quot; - its massive monthly purchases of long @-@ term assets - is stoking fears of a hard economic landing in China .
but China &apos;s strong economic fundamentals mean that policymakers have the space to avoid such an outcome - as long as they bring the country &apos;s shadow banking system under control .
as it stands , Chinese consumption and investment growth is expected to remain at roughly last year &apos;s levels .
meanwhile , economic recovery in the advanced economies , especially the United States and Europe , is reinvigorating external demand , leading analysts to project annual Chinese export growth of more than 10 % this year - 3 @-@ 4 percentage points higher than in 2013 .
this would bring annual GDP growth in 2014 to a very healthy 7.5 @-@ 8 % .
the problem is that China &apos;s financial sector has accumulated considerable risk in recent years , with broad money ( M2 ) having ballooned to ¥ 110.7 trillion ( $ 18 trillion ) - almost twice the country &apos;s GDP - at the end of last year .
in an attempt to rein in M2 , which could indicate that the economy is overleveraged , the central bank tightened conditions for commercial bank lending , so that , for any given increase in M2 , less credit is extended .
but the move failed to contain M2 growth ; on the contrary , M2 grew faster last year than in 2012 .
worse , restricting commercial banks &quot; role as financial intermediaries and encouraging the growth of unregulated shadow banking has generated even more risks for China &apos;s economy .
clearly , a new approach is needed - one that is based on a deeper understanding of the dangers inherent in China &apos;s banking system .
while it is true that surging M2 can reflect excessive leverage , it is not a particularly accurate gauge in China , where commercial banks can easily circumvent high reserve requirements and quantitative controls by moving loans off their balance sheets to wealth @-@ management products - practices that fuel artificial credit expansion that looks like M2 growth .
in this sense , it is the Chinese monetary authorities &quot; reluctance to open up the formal financial sector to domestic private capital , or to liberalize the deposit rate , that is fueling the expansion of shadow banking .
with small and medium @-@ sized enterprises ( SMEs ) - by far the economy &apos;s most important growth engine - unable to acquire sufficient funding from the formal financial sector , they have been forced to turn to informal channels .
as shadow banking has become the primary source of finance for SMEs - which tend to be higher @-@ risk borrowers - the financial risks in China &apos;s economy have grown exponentially .
exacerbating matters , the central bank &apos;s repeated efforts to tighten the money supply raises the cost of capital .
last June , the annualized interbank lending rate surged to more than 10 % - a level that it almost matched in December .
SMEs ultimately shoulder these costs , diminishing their ability to contribute to overall economic growth .
consider the Internet giant Alibaba , which began using Zhi @-@ fu @-@ Bao , the Chinese equivalent of PayPal , to raise money last year .
in just a few months , it received ¥ 400 billion from 85 million small investors .
Tencent , China &apos;s largest Internet company , is now using the same strategy to compete with Alibaba , with both companies offering high rates of return - often 6 @-@ 7 % annually - to attract as many investors as possible .
the problem is that most of this investment is in the interbank market , meaning that SMEs ultimately face interest rates of more than 10 % - and that does not include the added 3 % for SMEs &quot; loan guarantees .
these unsustainable high rates are transmitting major risks to the real economy .
nowhere is this more apparent than in the real @-@ estate sector .
liquidity @-@ thirsty developers , unable to acquire financing through the formal banking sector , have been taking out massive loans at extremely high interest rates .
but , in many cases , housing demand has not grown as expected , raising the risk of default - the effects of which would be transmitted to the entire financial sector .
the fact is that China has never been closer to a major financial crisis than it is today .
yet China &apos;s monetary authorities do not seem to understand the scale of the risk - or its root causes .
the Chinese economy may well need to be deleveraged .
but , instead of blindly tightening the credit supply , policymakers must pursue deep financial @-@ sector reform to liberalize the deposit rate , eliminate quantitative controls , and , most important , allow for the establishment of domestic private financial institutions .
pursuing this agenda is essential to China &apos;s long @-@ term financial and economic health .
but doing so presupposes a major shift in Chinese monetary authorities &quot; mindset .
therein lies the real challenge facing China today .
will the Yellow vests Reject the Brown shirts ?
Paris - From the moment the French government canceled its planned fuel tax hike in the face of massive protests , it was obvious that the move would be perceived as inadequate , insignificant , and above all incapable of having any calming effect .
honor to whom honor is due : the Yellow vests claim to be an expression of the sovereign people .
but they now bear a heavy responsibility .
for starters , they must announce a moratorium on demonstrations and blockades for a period long enough to accommodate the dialogue proposed by Prime Minister Édouard Philippe , if not longer .
in particular , they should renounce the much @-@ touted December 8 &quot; Act IV &quot; of the movement , brewing on Facebook since Saturday evening , which everyone expects to be more violent , destructive , and tragic than the preceding installments .
there have been enough deaths , injuries , and damage ( including to some of the most famous monuments in Paris ) .
if the Yellow vests decide the machine they have unleashed has overtaken them , and they can no longer stop Act IV , they must be prepared during the protests to help the police flush out the violent &quot; brown vests &quot; who will be circulating among them .
because the wreckers of the far right and far left will surely reappear to vandalize , terrorize , and desecrate ; it is up to the Yellow vests to say once again , this time as if they really mean it : not in our name .
whether the Yellow vests declare a moratorium or continue to protest , nothing would serve their cause better than to dissociate themselves - decisively and unambiguously - from all the political profiteers who would capitalize on their misery .
the cast of opportunists is well known .
here is Jean @-@ Luc Mélenchon , who , having finished fourth in the 2017 presidential election won by Emmanuel Macron , is desperately seeking a new following .
there is François Ruffin , the leader of the anti @-@ austerity movement Nuit Debout , with his irresponsible anti @-@ republican calls of &quot; resign , Macron ! &quot; and over there is Marine Le Pen , oscillating comically between taking pride in and repenting her call to occupy the Champs Élysées last Saturday , thereby becoming accountable for the worst of what was said and done there .
and there the intellectuals who , in the manner of Luc Ferry and Emmanuel Todd , suggest that it was perhaps not &quot; by chance &quot; that the wreckers had such an easy time approaching , storming , and sacking the Arc de Triomphe .
such rhetoric lays the worst of all traps for a popular movement : the trap of conspiratorial thinking .
in other words , the Yellow vests are at a crossroads .
either they will be bold enough to stop and take the time they need to get organized , following a path not unlike that of Macron &apos;s own La République en Marche ! , which , in hindsight , might appear to be the Yellow vests &quot; first @-@ to @-@ arrive twin .
Macron &apos;s movement , too , had right and left wings . and it knew that it was a new political body , engaging in a dialogue or even a showdown that would lead to an honest reckoning with poverty and the high cost of living .
if the Yellow vests build a movement that rises to the height of Macron &apos;s , it may end up writing a page in the history of France .
or the Yellow vests may turn out to lack that boldness and settle for the paltry pleasure of being seen on television .
they will allow themselves to become intoxicated by the sight of luminaries and experts of la France d &apos;en haut ( elite France ) seeming to eat from their hands and hanging on their every word .
but if the Yellow vests allow passionate hate to win out over genuine fraternity and choose wrecking over reforming , they will bring only chaos , not improvement , to the lives of humble and vulnerable people .
they will careen off into the darkest side of the political night , and end up in the dustbin of history , where they can rub elbows with those other yellows , the early @-@ twentieth @-@ century &quot; Yellow Socialists &quot; of the proto @-@ fascist syndicalist Pierre Biétry .
the Yellow vests must choose : democratic re @-@ invention , or an updated version of the national socialist leagues ; a will to repair , or the urge to destroy .
the decision will hinge on the historic essence of the movement - whether its reflexes are good or bad , and whether , in the final analysis , it possesses political and moral courage .
so the ball is in the Yellow vests &quot; court .
they have the initiative as much as Macron does .
will they say , &quot; Yes , we believe in republican democracy ? &quot;
and will they say it loud and clear , without equivocation ?
or will they place themselves in the tradition of paranoid nihilism and pollute their ranks with the political vandals that France still produces in abundance ?
did US Drone Strikes Lose Yemen ?
new YORK - Recent revelations that the US killed an innocent American in a drone strike in Pakistan confirm what a new study , &quot; Death by Drone , &quot; of civilian harm caused by US drone strikes in Yemen shows - that claims about the precision of drone strikes are overstated .
the revelations also underscore the stark asymmetry between how the US treats drone strikes that kill its own citizens and those that kill others . while the Obama administration has now publicly acknowledged that it has recently killed three US citizens in drone strikes , it has refused to acknowledge countless other drone strikes around the world which have killed non @-@ US civilians .
in Yemen , the US has been conducting drone strikes since at least 2002 , with estimates of the total number of strikes ranging from 91 to 203 .
while the American and Yemeni governments have lauded the drones &quot; precise targeting , they have refused to meaningfully disclose key details about the strikes , including how many have been conducted , who has been targeted , or , crucially , the number and identities of civilians killed .
in a May 2013 speech at the National Defense University , Obama offered assurances that , outside the Afghan war theater , no drone strike would be carried out unless there was &quot; near @-@ certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured . &quot;
Obama also claimed that the US targets only &quot; terrorists who pose a continuing and imminent threat to the American people , &quot; and that it does not launch drone strikes when it has &quot; the ability to capture individual terrorists . &quot;
&quot; death by Drone , &quot; which includes first @-@ hand testimony from eyewitnesses and survivors of drone strikes in Yemen , tells a different story .
the nine case studies documented in the report , four of which cover attacks that came after the 2013 speech , provide credible evidence that US drone strikes have killed and injured Yemeni civilians , suggesting that the &quot; near @-@ certainty &quot; standard is not being effectively implemented .
the report also casts doubt on Obama &apos;s other claims , with evidence indicating that targets of drone strikes , though perhaps posing a threat to Yemen , may not have posed a direct threat to the US , and that their capture may have been possible .
in other words , Yemeni civilians have suffered and died from drone strikes that may not have been necessary .
more generally , the report provides a window into the experiences of Yemeni civilians directly affected by US drone strikes .
the testimonies of these individuals , vital for assessing the US drone program , are all too easy to overlook because these individuals are poor and have no political influence , and because the strikes are conducted in secret , far away from the US .
as Yaslem Saeed bin Ishaq , whose son was killed in a US drone strike in Wadi Sir on August 1 , 2013 , observed , &quot; They just kill .
they do not know what havoc their missiles have caused . they are unaware of the suffering they create for our families . &quot;
indeed , if the US never acknowledges the specific strikes , how can ordinary Americans possibly know that Rasilah al @-@ Faqih , a pregnant Yemeni woman , was killed in Walad Rabei , &quot; along with her husband and ten @-@ year @-@ old daughter , as they headed home from a visit to the doctor ?
or that Abdoh Mohammed al @-@ Jarraah &apos;s house in Silat al @-@ Jarraah had 19 people , including women and children , inside when it was hit by a US drone strike ?
the US &quot; refusal to acknowledge drone strikes that kill foreigners is sending a damaging message in Yemen and beyond .
as Moqbel Abdullah Ali al @-@ Jarraah , a villager from Silat al @-@ Jarraah , put it : &quot; I believe that America is testing its lethal inventions in our poor villages , because &#91; it &#93; cannot afford to do so at any place where human life has value . here , we are without value . &quot;
in every incident recorded in this report , the families of Yemeni civilians killed in US strikes want to know why they were targeted .
as the father of Nasser Mohammed Nasser , one of four innocent civilians killed in a US drone strike on April 19 , 2014 , lamented : &quot; my son and those who were with him had nothing to do with Al Qaeda . they were simply on their way to earn a living .
why , then , did the American aircraft strike them ? &quot;
but the US has given Nasser no answers .
it has not even acknowledged that it killed his son .
in February 2013 , then @-@ White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan testified at his Senate confirmation hearing to become CIA Director that , &quot; in the interest of transparency , &quot; the US must acknowledge mistaken killings publicly .
later that month , he recognized that the US government &quot; should make public the overall numbers of civilian deaths resulting from US strikes targeting Al Qaeda . &quot; the US has done neither .
it should come as no surprise , then , that civilians like Nasser , who have lost mothers , fathers , sons , and daughters in US strikes , are outraged not only at the US , but also at the Yemeni government , which consented to the attacks .
they believe that instead of making Yemen and the US safer , drone strikes only strengthen support for Al Qaeda .
earlier this year , the US announced a new policy for drone exports , purportedly part of a broader effort to work with other countries to &quot; shape international standards &quot; on the use of drones and compel recipient states &quot; to use these systems in accordance with international law . &quot;
but , as &quot; Death by Drone &quot; shows , the US drone program is fundamentally flawed and should not be perpetuated . the Obama administration &apos;s recent admissions that its drone strikes killed its own citizens only underscore this fact .
can Yemen Be Saved ?
Sana &apos;a - Yemen is no stranger to crisis .
exposed to a regional proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia , plagued by an entrenched Al Qaeda affiliate , and divided by tribal disputes and a secession movement , the country has become a poster child for everything that can go wrong in the Arab world .
Yemen has demonstrated remarkable resiliency in the past .
to ensure that the recent overthrow of its government by the Shia Houthi rebel movement does not deal Yemen the lethal blow that it has avoided so far , the international community must not abandon the country in what may be its hour of greatest need .
the origins of the Houthi movement date to 1991 , when it was created to protect Zaydism , a moderate form of Shi &apos;ism , from the encroachment of Sunni Islamists .
after the attacks on New York and Washington , DC , on September 11 , 2001 , the group &apos;s battle took on a geopolitical dimension , as its fighters objected to Yemen &apos;s decision to collaborate with the United States and enhance bilateral intelligence cooperation .
from 2004 to 2010 , the group fought six wars against the Yemeni government and even skirmished with Saudi Arabia .
yet it never managed to expand its reach beyond its stronghold in the north of the country .
that changed in 2011 , when the popular protests and political chaos stemming from the Arab Spring led to widespread institutional paralysis , allowing the Houthis to march past a military that largely refused to fight it .
the group &apos;s power grab has frightened its adversaries , leading them to seek new alliances that could imperil the state &apos;s security .
in the central region of Marib , home to the oil and gas facilities that Yemen relies on for foreign currency , several tribes have vowed to fight the Houthis .
the region was once a stronghold of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) , an affiliate of the global terrorist organization .
if the military refuses to assist the tribes - as is likely - they may be tempted to turn to AQAP .
the situation is no less precarious in the southern provinces , where a secession movement has been active since 2007 .
southerners are up in arms because the Houthi rebellion halted plans for the adoption of a federal system , which would have given the region greater autonomy .
in response , armed groups seized checkpoints and closed the port of Aden .
the risk of secession is very real .
southern Sunnis have been marginalized since a 1994 civil war that left northerners in control of most of the country &apos;s political institutions .
many in the region worry that the Houthis will discriminate against them further .
AQAP is firmly rooted in this region as well , implying the possibility that local residents will seek its help in defending against an expected Houthi onslaught .
meanwhile , Yemen continues to serve as a battleground in a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia .
Iran has armed and trained the Houthis , and , though the rebels &apos; brand of Shi &apos;ism shares little with that practiced in Tehran , they have praised the Islamic Republic &apos;s founder , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , and held up Iran &apos;s Lebanese proxy , Hezbollah , as a model to be emulated .
when the Houthis took over Sana &apos;a , the capital , in September , Saudi Arabia cut off aid to the country .
to make matters worse , falling oil prices and attacks on pipelines imperil a hydrocarbon industry that
decreased earnings led Yemen to forecast a $ 3.2 billion budget deficit last year .
if the turmoil is not curtailed and the Saudis do not resume the payments that have long ensured the country &apos;s ability to function , Yemen may not be able to cover its expenditures .
the US has followed Saudi Arabia &apos;s lead , shuttering its embassy and freezing intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism operations .
this is a mistake .
Yemen &apos;s military is largely intact , having remained in its barracks as the Houthis marched to the capital , and there is little evidence that the units that work with the Americans are loyal to the new rebel government .
suspending cooperation risks giving AQAP free rein in a country where it was able to wreak havoc even when bridled .
Yemen is mired in crises that it cannot solve alone .
unless its international allies throw it a lifeline , it risks being swallowed by a sea of disorder that could imperil the entire region .
Yemen &apos;s Regime Change Gets Personal
Sanaa - When Yemen &apos;s President Ali Abdullah Saleh ordered his military on March 18 to fire on peaceful protesters calling for his resignation , he sealed his fate .
a wave of military , government , and diplomatic defections , led by his long @-@ time ally First armored Brigade Commander General Ali Muhsin al @-@ Ahmar , rocked his regime .
but , although al @-@ Ahmar announced that he was appalled by the use of force and vowed to defend the constitution , his decision was anything but altruistic .
the disgruntled general , who has long @-@ standing ties to the type of jihadists that the United States is battling in Yemen , merely sought to settle a score with the president &apos;s family .
the relationship between al @-@ Ahmar and Saleh extends to their youth , with Saleh &apos;s mother having had a second marriage to al @-@ Ahmar &apos;s uncle .
though they are not half @-@ brothers , this frequent , if mistaken reference , indicates their closeness .
al @-@ Ahmar has long been considered either Saleh &apos;s right hand man or the country &apos;s hidden president .
when the Nasserite party attempted to overthrow Saleh less than 100 days into his presidency , al @-@ Ahmar defended him and quashed the coup .
in 1994 , his units put down a secessionist movement in the south .
but , as Saleh prepared the way for his son Ahmad - the head of the Presidential Guard - to succeed him , he began to marginalize al @-@ Ahmar .
in 2009 , Saleh sacked al @-@ Ahmar &apos;s key backers , including Central Command Chief General al @-@ Thahiri al @-@ Shadadi and Lieutenant General Haydar al @-@ Sanhani , from power .
al @-@ Ahmar has also not benefited from the military aid that the US lavished on Yemen in the wake of al @-@ Qaeda &apos;s failed Christmas Day plot in 2009 to down an American airliner .
while the Central Security Service , led by Saleh &apos;s nephew Yahya , has received millions of dollars to fight al @-@ Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , al @-@ Ahmar has been left out of the economic bonanza .
at the same time , al @-@ Ahmar &apos;s dismal performance in spearheading the war against the Houthi @-@ led sectarian rebellion in the north made him a convenient scapegoat for the regime &apos;s failures .
the regime &apos;s desire to get al @-@ Ahmar out of the picture became clear during the last round of fighting aginst the Houthis in 2009 @-@ 2010 , when Saudi Arabia began bombing the rebels . according to a US diplomatic cable released by WikiLeaks , Yemeni officials gave the Saudis the coordinates for al @-@ Ahmar &apos;s command center , telling them that it was a Houthi camp .
his relationship with Saleh frayed and his influence waning , al @-@ Ahmar understood that his loyalty to Saleh had become a liability .
so his decision to abandon Saleh stemmed less from his love of the constitution and democracy than from his desire to even the score with the president and his son Ahmad Saleh , with whom he has long clashed .
their units skirmished during the Houthi campaign , and the two engaged in a power struggle over defense of the radio and television stations .
Saleh won at the time , but today al @-@ Ahmar &apos;s troops have control .
al @-@ Ahmar &apos;s relationship with jihadists is a source of serious concern .
he is married to the sister of Tariq al @-@ Fadhli , a Yemeni who fought alongside al @-@ Qaeda leader Osama bin Ladin in Afghanistan .
when more than 4,000 Arabs returned from fighting the Soviets there , al @-@ Ahmar organized them into units and deployed them in the 1994 civil war .
one jihadist who trained in al @-@ Qaeda &apos;s camps , and met bin Ladin , told me that upon his return from Afghanistan , he was invited to meet al @-@ Ahmar &apos;s associates and was given a monthly stipend .
during a 1999 trial of Yemenis convicted of kidnapping 16 Europeans , it emerged that the group &apos;s ringleader called al @-@ Ahmar during the ordeal .
though his ties to jihadists may be expedient rather than ideological , they are deeply worrying .
today , Saleh &apos;s support among his top generals is dwindling .
of Yemen &apos;s four regional commanders , only Southern Command Chief General Mahdi Maqwala still backs him .
lesser lieutenant generals have deserted the president in droves .
the fate of the country may not hinge on Saleh , a crafty veteran who knows that his career is over .
but his son Ahmad , who is less politically astute , may yet seek to settle accounts with al @-@ Ahmar .
his forces have already clashed with rival units in Mukalla and surrounded the presidential palace in Aden .
if the Salehs retain control of the air force , which remains under the control of Saleh &apos;s half @-@ brother , employing it against defecting military divisions would likely lead to a bloodbath .
nevertheless , the doomsday scenarios predicting anarchy and chaos in the post @-@ Saleh era are most likely exaggerated .
unlike in Egypt , the vacuum resulting from Saleh &apos;s departure can be quickly filled , so the country need not fall back on a military oligarchy .
the Yemeni opposition is not only organized , but also plays an active role in politics and has true grassroots support .
and , unlike in Egypt , where the ruling party was detested and out of touch with the masses , Yemen &apos;s General People &apos;s Congress has some following in society . if Saleh leaves peacefully and represses the urge to unleash the last remaining loyal army units against protesters and defecting soldiers , the country can avert Libya @-@ like mayhem .
indeed , the opposition parties have already organized a transitional council to take Saleh &apos;s place .
with the sun quickly setting on the Saleh era , the president is out of options .
the only decision before him and his thinning ranks of allies is whether to leave peacefully or go down fighting .
Japan vs. the Currency speculators
Tokyo - With Japan &apos;s economy struggling to escape its deflationary torpor , the economic @-@ revitalization plan that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe launched in 2012 has come under growing scrutiny .
but Japan &apos;s current travails , which have brought a concomitant decline in Japan &apos;s stock market , stem from the yen &apos;s appreciation - 24 % over the last year - against major currencies .
&quot; Abenomics &quot; - which included substantial monetary and fiscal expansion - has nothing to do with it .
since Abenomics was introduced , Japan &apos;s labor market has improved considerably : 1.5 million new jobs have been created , and the unemployment rate has fallen to just over 3 % .
moreover , corporate profits have soared , and tax revenues have increased by more than ¥ 20 trillion ( $ 188 billion ) .
to build on these gains , Japan has promised a large fiscal expansion next month , which some describe as a piecemeal , temporary version of so @-@ called &quot; helicopter drops &quot; ( permanent monetization of government debt ) .
but there is concern that it will not be enough , if the yen continues to appreciate .
to be sure , expansionary policies , particularly monetary policies - a pillar of Abenomics - could contribute to currency depreciation .
but the US Federal Reserve &apos;s dovish approach to exiting its own quantitative @-@ easing program , together with expansionary policies in other major economies , has weakened their impact on the exchange rate .
more recently , the United Kingdom &apos;s vote to &quot; Brexit &quot; the European Union , together with the introduction of negative rates by multiple central banks , including the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) , shook markets .
taking advantage of this nervousness , hedge @-@ fund managers and other speculators have increasingly been betting on the yen &apos;s appreciation ; indeed , the Chicago Mercantile Exchange shows substantial interest in the yen futures market .
in a flexible exchange @-@ rate system , each country conducts monetary policy independently , based on domestic objectives , and accepts the resulting exchange rate .
but when exchange @-@ rate movements become sharp or erratic , monetary authorities have the authority - even the obligation - to intervene to smooth them out .
the Japanese authorities seem to recognize this , in theory .
on August 18 , officials from the Ministry of Finance ( MOF ) , the Financial Services Agency , and the BOJ gathered to discuss what can be done to stem the yen &apos;s appreciation .
after the meeting , Masatsugu Asakawa , the deputy minister of finance for international affairs , declared that the MOF would act swiftly against exchange @-@ rate movements deemed to be speculative .
the announcement was supposed to cause speculators to shake in their boots .
yet markets moved only slightly , within a range of a couple of yen to the dollar .
after all , the MOF has made such threats before - for example , just after the introduction of the BOJ &apos;s negative interest @-@ rate policy , and again after the Brexit decision - but never followed through .
like Aesop &apos;s boy who cried wolf , the MOF has lost credibility , at least when it comes to the threat of intervention in currency markets .
so speculators remain convinced that they are making a one @-@ way bet - win big or break even - and continue to push the yen higher .
at this point , the MOF &apos;s words will not be enough to deter speculation .
but the MOF remains hesitant to back its tough talk with action , not least because of American disapproval of supposed &quot; currency manipulation . &quot;
high @-@ level officials at the US Treasury and Federal Reserve actively try to dissuade advocacy of direct intervention , including by me .
an American scholar reacted angrily when I merely mentioned the word , as if it were an obscenity .
American officials , for their part , emphasize that if Japan can be accused of manipulating currency markets , the US Congress will not approve the Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) .
it is possible that the MOF will choose to keep the US on its side , and continue to offer only empty threats to speculators .
or it may simply vacillate until it is too late to take real action .
either approach may well produce the same disastrous result : allowing the yen to appreciate to damaging levels and causing Abenomics to fail .
what the MOF should do is intervene courageously in currency markets to stem the yen &apos;s appreciation .
speculators will learn a tough lesson , and Japan &apos;s economy could get back on track .
though Japan may become a scapegoat for the failure of the TPP , it seems unlikely that the deal would be ratified in any case , given the current political climate in the United States .
an alternative would be for the BOJ to purchase foreign securities .
many hedge @-@ fund managers , along with some economists , claim that the key to saving Japan &apos;s economy from deflation is a more direct helicopter drop , with newly printed cash delivered directly to consumers .
yet these same people are impeding effective macroeconomic policy , by betting on the yen &apos;s appreciation .
only when the speculators are brought to heel should such a bold - and highly risky - monetary policy even be up for discussion .
women &apos;s Development Goals
new YORK - As the 2015 deadline for the United Nations Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) approaches , world leaders will face a choice : move the goal posts back another decade or two , or hold accountable those who have failed to deliver on their commitments .
for women , the choice is clear .
we have been here before .
in 1978 , at the International Conference on Primary Health Care in Alma @-@ Ata , 134 states signed a declaration calling for adequate health care for all by the year 2000 .
sixteen years later , in 1994 , in Cairo , 179 governments embraced reproductive rights as a basic human right and adopted resolutions to ensure the provision of universal access to a full range of reproductive health services , including family planning .
yet those deadlines had come and gone when , in September 2000 , during the 55th UN General Assembly , leaders of 189 nations adopted the MDGs .
and several other commitments and resolutions were undertaken by world leaders before and after the MDG declaration .
so , where are we now ?
we know that several MDG targets have already been met . extreme poverty has been more than halved since 2000 , to about 22 % in 2010 - taking almost 700 million people out of the ranks of the world &apos;s poorest .
we have seen positive results in the fight against HIV / AIDS , malaria , and tuberculosis .
billions of people have access to improved drinking water ; and many have gained access to sanitation ( though a billion people still have to resort to open defecation - a major health risk ) .
there has also been progress on gender equality .
girls and boys attend school in equal numbers , and women are increasingly making themselves heard in the political arena .
but the picture quickly becomes cloudy .
though chronic under @-@ nutrition among young children has declined , one in four children - 162 million children , according to the World Health Organization - are still affected by stunting .
indeed , maternal and child mortality has decreased by millions , but many of these preventable deaths are still claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of women and children each year .
moreover , the UN Foundation reports that 222 million women still cannot access the most basic information , products , and services that would enable them to decide how many children to have and to time their pregnancies in ways that preserve their health , enable them to pursue an education , and improve their lives .
the same report notes that more than 300,000 girls and women aged 15 @-@ 19 die every year from pregnancy @-@ related complications , while many more are left to deal with debilitating disabilities .
the UN secretary @-@ general &apos;s 2013 report &quot; A Life of Dignity for All &quot; calls for a universal agenda to ensure that no one is left behind . but millions of people - and particularly women - already are being left behind .
and , because world leaders and their development partners have failed to meet women &apos;s basic reproductive @-@ health needs once again , it will be more difficult to achieve concrete progress toward realizing the agenda for sustainable development .
the UN &apos;s own calls to accelerate momentum at the launch of the 500 @-@ day countdown to the MDGs &quot; expiry highlight the fact that inequality , maternal mortality from childbirth , lack of universal education , and environmental degradation remain serious challenges .
to truly affect change - and not only for women - we need global support for access to family planning , women &apos;s and children &apos;s health services , and support for empowerment initiatives .
an educated woman is better able to take care of herself , make informed choices , and broaden her contribution to her community .
when we leave women behind , we leave their communities behind , too .
no one disputes that development must be inclusive and equitable .
what is missing from the diplomatic discourse is a strong framework to hold governments and development partners accountable for translating lofty ideals like human rights - particularly the right to access basic health and social services - into practical solutions .
as the post @-@ 2015 sustainable development agenda is drafted , world leaders and their development partners need to think beyond setting new goals or targets that fade with time , and move toward establishing accountability mechanisms , processes , and systems to ensure that we meet the goals that we have already set .
we must break away from the current unwritten code of &quot; zero accountability &quot; for leaders who fail to honor their own commitments to internationally agreed goals .
in short , our governments must begin to do what they have promised .
without strong accountability mechanisms , ending preventable maternal deaths and fostering sustainable and equitable development will continue to elude us as we move into increasingly perilous times .
Asia &apos;s Military Revolution
Seoul - A vast revolution in military affairs is taking place across East Asia .
the latest signs are Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s purge of General Xu Caihou , an ex @-@ Politburo member and former vice @-@ chairman of the Central Military Commission , on charges of corruption , and Japan &apos;s &quot; reinterpretation &quot; of Article 9 of its constitution to permit the country to provide military aid to its allies .
despite the rising regional tensions that inspired these moves , China &apos;s relations with its neighbors and the United States are not fated to lead to direct confrontation .
but the relentless march of new initiatives to meet the perceived &quot; China threat &quot; will require the region &apos;s political leaders , including the Chinese , to address their disputes in new and more creative ways if that outcome is to be avoided .
in general , there are three ways to foster international peace : deepening economic interdependence , promoting democracy , and building international institutions .
unfortunately , because East Asia &apos;s political leaders have failed to pursue the latter objective , they now find themselves playing dangerous balance @-@ of @-@ power games reminiscent of Europe a century ago .
deepening economic interdependence in the wake of Asia &apos;s 1997 financial crisis has not generated political momentum for peace and cooperation .
the region &apos;s business leaders have been unable to prevent deteriorating foreign relations from harming their interests .
by contrast , military lobbying now deeply influences foreign and defense policies - witness China &apos;s double @-@ digit increase in defense spending and rising US arms sales in the region .
what explains this failure ?
international @-@ relations theorists since Immanuel Kant have held that democracies rarely ( if ever ) fight one another ; as a result , political leaders , such as US President Woodrow Wilson , have tried to promote democracy as a means to spread peace .
until recently , the US seemed to have assumed that China &apos;s engagement with Western democracies would bolster peaceful ties .
but , since the 2008 financial crisis , China &apos;s confidence in its authoritarian development model has grown stronger .
its leaders now increasingly appear to believe that a new &quot; Beijing Consensus &quot; of mercantilism and state intervention has replaced the old &quot; Washington Consensus &quot; of free trade and deregulation .
China &apos;s ideological incompatibility with the US thus is making the shift in their relative power difficult to achieve peacefully .
in the late nineteenth century , a rising US was able to cooperate with a declining Britain , owing to their shared culture and values .
China &apos;s leaders , however , tend to suspect that the US is deliberately trying to undermine their country &apos;s political stability by questioning its record on human rights and political freedoms .
meanwhile , Xi &apos;s domestic policies seem to be taking the country ever further from Western norms .
it is this ideological divide that is undermining the development in East Asia of institutions that establish principles , rules , and decision @-@ making procedures for the region .
while much of the West is bound together by institutions like the Organization for Security Cooperation in Europe and NATO , East Asia &apos;s main body , the ASEAN Regional Forum , is too weak to play an analogous role , leaving the region beset with unregulated rivalries .
so far , US and East Asian leaders have done little beyond offering rhetorical support for the creation of multilateral security institutions .
with the exception of the almost defunct six @-@ party talks aimed at eliminating the nuclear threat posed by North Korea , Asia &apos;s powers refuse to be constrained by international rules or norms .
instead , East Asia &apos;s leaders resort to realpolitik .
unfortunately , unlike Europe &apos;s nineteenth @-@ century political masterminds - figures like Talleyrand , Metternich , Bismarck , and Disraeli - who crafted durable international alliances , Asia lacks leaders willing and able to look beyond their narrow national interests .
for example , China &apos;s leaders seem to believe that the 2008 economic crisis and the high costs of two foreign wars have left the US in no position to exercise international leadership .
that may explain China &apos;s recent foreign @-@ policy assertiveness , particularly in its dispute with Japan over control of the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands , which could be intended to probe the strength of the US @-@ Japan alliance .
testing US power in this way could prove to be a dangerous miscalculation .
though weakened economically , the US remains a military superpower .
its interests in East Asia date back to the late nineteenth century .
just as Britain refused to concede naval supremacy to Germany a century ago , the US will not easily accept any Chinese challenge to its strategic position in the western Pacific , especially given that so many East Asian states are pleading for US protection .
China and the US need to talk .
despite their economic interdependence and some 90 inter @-@ governmental channels for bilateral dialogue , the two superpowers are caught in a perilous tug @-@ of @-@ war over interests in the East and South China Seas and the western Pacific .
Sino @-@ Japanese relations are particularly fraught , with two decades of economic stagnation in Japan and rapid growth in China fueling nationalist overreaction on both sides .
having become accustomed to outsourcing its security to the US , and despite having the world &apos;s third @-@ largest economy , Japan neglected to develop its own constructive diplomatic vision .
it remains to be seen whether Abe &apos;s constitutional reinterpretation , cloaked in the language of regional cooperation , advances such a new vision .
it does not help that the US wants Japan to shoulder more of the burden of maintaining Asia &apos;s security , a position that may make sense strategically and financially , but that betrays a lack of understanding of the political context .
the US seems to underestimate regional concerns over Japan &apos;s potential remilitarization .
by providing Japan with a diplomatic carte blanche , the US may find itself hostage to Japanese interests , with the result that Japan becomes part of Asia &apos;s security problem , not part of its solution .
Asia @-@ Pacific leaders must shake off their complacency .
serious efforts and far @-@ reaching compromises are needed to begin the process of building institutions for regional security cooperation .
otherwise , the much @-@ heralded &quot; Asian century , &quot; far from bringing economic prosperity and peace , will be an age of suspicion and peril .
the Politics of Young and Old
Paris - If one considers some of today &apos;s main challenges - including climate change , pensions , public debt , and the labor market - an obvious conclusion emerges : it is relatively much worse to be young today than it was a quarter @-@ century ago .
yet in most countries , the generational dimension is remarkably absent from the political debate .
fifty years ago , people spoke often , and loudly , of a &quot; generation gap . &quot;
today , that gap has become invisible .
this is bad for the young , for democracy , and for social justice .
start with climate change .
its containment requires changing habits and investing in emission reductions so that future generations will have a habitable planet .
the alarm bell was first rung in 1992 at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro ; but over the last generation , little was done to contain emissions .
and progress following the landmark agreement achieved in Paris in December is unlikely to be fast , because the accord is premised on postponing major efforts .
universal assent was made possible only by further delaying .
given the massive inertia inherent in the greenhouse effect , the gap between responsible and irresponsible behavior will start resulting in different temperatures only in a quarter @-@ century , and major consequences will follow only in 50 years .
anyone older than 60 today will hardly notice the difference between the two scenarios .
but the fate of most citizens currently younger than 30 will be fundamentally affected .
in due course , the respite gained by the older generations will have to be paid for by the younger ones .
now consider debt .
since 1990 , public debt has increased by about 40 percentage points of GDP in the European Union and the United States ( and much more in Japan ) .
given near @-@ zero interest rates , the corresponding drag on income is currently low ; but , because inflation is virtually inexistent and growth is anemic , the debt ratios have only stabilized .
so debt reduction will take longer than expected in the aftermath of the global crisis , which will deprive the coming generations of the fiscal space they might need to invest in climate action or in the containment of security threats .
future pensions represent another form of debt .
the pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ go ( PAYG ) systems in place in many countries are giant intergenerational transfer schemes .
true , everyone is expected to contribute while they work , before becoming a recipient in retirement .
in an ideal steady state , pension regimes would not redistribute income across cohorts born at different points in time .
as specialists say , they would be generationally neutral .
but the baby boomers ( those born from the mid @-@ 1940s to the mid @-@ 1960s ) paid little into the PAYG schemes because economic growth , population size , and their parents &quot; low life expectancy made financing pensions easy .
all these factors have now gone into reverse : growth has slowed , the baby boomers are a demographic bulge weighing on their children , and they are expected to live long .
countries where pension reforms were introduced early have been able to limit the resulting burden on the young and keep the balance between generations approximately fair .
but countries where reforms were delayed have allowed that balance to place the young at a disadvantage .
finally , consider the labor market .
over the last decade , conditions for new entrants have worsened markedly in many countries .
the number of young people categorized as NEET ( neither in employment nor in education or training ) currently stands at 10.2 million in the US and 14 million in the EU .
furthermore , many of those who have recently entered the labor market have suffered from job insecurity and repeated spells of unemployment .
in continental Europe , especially , young workers are the first to suffer from economic downturns .
on all of these issues - climate , debt , pensions , and jobs - the younger generations have been made relatively worse off by developments over the last quarter @-@ century .
a telling symbol is that there is often more poverty among the young than among the elderly .
this ought to be a major political issue , with significant implications for public finances , social protection , tax policy , and labor market regulation . and it reinforces the imperative of reviving growth through productivity @-@ boosting policies .
yet the new generation gap has had little direct political effect .
it hardly arises in electoral debate and has generally not led to the emergence of new parties or movements .
instead , the generational divide shows up in electoral participation .
in the latest US mid @-@ term elections , the turnout rate among younger citizens was less than 20 % , compared to more than 50 % for senior voters .
similar trends are observable in other countries .
despite the increased uncertainty they face , younger citizens are much more disengaged from electoral politics than their parents and grandparents were at the same age .
this generational gap in electoral participation explains why politicians care more about the elderly than about the young .
but in aging societies , the more the young abstain from voting , the more decisions by parliaments and governments will be biased against their interests .
true , parents are generally not selfish .
they help their children through private transfers and grants .
but only those with income and wealth can provide meaningful support .
the result of neglecting young people collectively while supporting them privately is social inequality on a massive scale .
how to redress generational biases in the political system is a key question for all democracies .
solutions do exist : mandatory voting , term limits for elected officials , and youth parliaments or special bodies to examine intergenerational issues , for example .
but such measures are either difficult to implement or only moderately effective in view of the magnitude of the challenges .
current trends are clearly unsustainable politically and socially .
what is unclear is when and how young people will recognize that and make themselves heard .
your genes or Mine , How Different Are We ?
for some time , scientists have believed that individual human beings were 99.9 % genetically identical .
the 0.1 % of the genome that was different ( approximately 3,000,000 bases of DNA ) was comprised of &quot; single nucleotide polymorphisms &quot; ( SNPs are alterations of the individual bases of DNA ) scattered throughout the genome .
it was thought that some of these DNA alterations may in part explain some of the physical differences that exist between two different , but otherwise normal individuals .
in the summer of 2004 , two groups of scientists working independently ( one led by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women &apos;s Hospital in Boston and the other led by researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories ) called this scientific dogma into question .
their research identified hundreds of regions of the human genome where the number of copies of a particular DNA segment varied from individual to individual .
with only a few exceptions , all DNA segments were thought to exist in two copies ( one copy inherited from your mother and one copy inherited from your father ) .
both studies showed that there are hundreds of regions of the genome that could have more or less than the expected two copies .
this alerted scientists to the existence of a larger source of genetic variation than was previously understood , and forced us to speculate on the implications of this discovery .
this discovery was made recently because until now , the technology was not available to comprehensively assess genomic imbalances in a genome @-@ wide fashion .
that has changed over the last five or six years , with the development of a technique known as &quot; array @-@ based comparative genomic hybridization &quot; ( array @-@ CGH ) , revolutionizing genetic research and diagnostics .
about three years ago at Brigham and Women &apos;s Hospital , when we were seeking a potential tool for high @-@ resolution diagnostics , array @-@ CGH offered the hope of providing a reliable and efficient genome @-@ wide test that could detect gains or losses in an unbiased and non @-@ subjective fashion .
when validation experiments were performed that compared the DNA from one &quot; normal , healthy &quot; individual with the DNA from another &quot; normal , healthy &quot; individual , we were astonished to find an average of 12 DNA fragments that showed copy number differences between the two individuals being compared .
these became known as copy number variants , or CNVs .
combining the data from our study and the study from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories , over 300 regions of the genome were found to exhibit CNVs among normal individuals .
since these two initial studies , many other groups , including ours , have confirmed and documented many more CNVs in other individuals studied .
this is the goal of the Structural Genomic variation Consortium &apos;s copy Number variation Project , which aims at providing researchers the most comprehensive list and characterization of CNVs in humans .
the Consortium recently assessed 270 individuals from four populations with ancestry in Africa , Asia or Europe ( known as the HapMap collection ) to construct a new map of the human genome .
using two complementary genome @-@ wide technologies , with subsequent validation studies , a total of 1,447 CNVs were identified .
the data clearly demonstrate that individuals are not as genetically similar as once thought .
many of the regions in which the CNVs were identified overlapped known disease genes .
since they are being identified in normal individuals , CNVs may not necessarily be a direct cause of human disease , but many may confer susceptibility to certain diseases , serve as disease markers , and / or indicate potential regions of genomic instability .
some CNVs are also associated with genes involved in immune response and detoxification @-@ related metabolism ( some of the human body &apos;s reactions to the environment that we live in ) .
indeed , some CNVs may turn out to explain why some people react differently to specific medications .
hopefully , a more comprehensive understanding of human genetic variation ( i.e. single base pair changes and structural genomic variation , such as CNVs ) will ultimately help physicians to prescribe medication in a more individualized manner , that would result in maximum therapeutic effects to each patient , with minimal side effects .
overall , we anticipate that many of these CNVs will provide explanations to how we adapt and interact with our ever @-@ changing environment .
indeed , as studies continue to identify and characterize CNVs , we anticipate achieving a better understanding of the relationship between these genetic variations , complex diseases , and human adaptability .
Unburdening the Facebook Generation
Los ANGELES - Once again , young people have gotten the short end of the political stick .
the outcome of the United Kingdom &apos;s Brexit referendum is but another reminder of a yawning generational divide that cuts across political affiliation , income levels , and race .
almost 75 % of UK voters aged 18 @-@ 24 voted to &quot; Remain &quot; in the European Union , only to have &quot; Leave &quot; imposed on them by older voters .
and this is just one of several ways in which millennials &quot; economic future , and that of their children , is being determined by others .
I am in my late fifties , and I worry that our generation in the advanced world will be remembered - to our shame and chagrin - as the one that lost the economic plot .
in the run @-@ up to the 2008 global financial crisis , we feasted on leverage , feeling increasingly entitled to use credit to live beyond our means and to assume too much speculative financial risk .
we stopped investing in genuine engines of growth , letting our infrastructure decay , our education system lag , and our worker training and retooling programs erode .
we allowed the budget to be taken hostage by special interests , which has resulted in a fragmentation of the tax system that , no surprise , has imparted yet another unfair anti @-@ growth bias to the economic system .
and we witnessed a dramatic worsening in inequality , not just of income and wealth , but also of opportunity .
the 2008 crisis should have been our economic wake @-@ up call .
it wasn &apos;t .
rather than using the crisis to catalyze change , we essentially rolled over and went back to doing more of the same .
specifically , we simply exchanged private factories of credit and leverage for public ones .
we swapped an over @-@ leveraged banking system for experimental liquidity injections by hyperactive monetary authorities .
in the process , we overburdened central banks , risking their credibility and political autonomy , as well as future financial stability .
emerging from the crisis , we shifted private liabilities from banks &quot; balance sheets to taxpayers , including future ones , yet we failed to fix fully the bailed @-@ out financial sector .
we let inequality worsen , and stood by as too many young people in Europe languished in joblessness , risking a scary transition from unemployment to unemployability .
in short , we didn &apos;t do nearly enough to reinvigorate the engines of sustainable inclusive growth , thereby also weakening potential output and threatening future economic performance .
and we are compounding these serial miscarriages with a grand failure to act on longer @-@ term sustainability , particularly when it comes to the planet and social cohesion .
poor economics has naturally spilled over into messy politics , as growing segments of the population have lost trust in the political establishment , business elites , and expert opinion .
the resulting political fragmentation , including the rise of fringe and anti @-@ establishment movements , has made it even harder to devise more appropriate economic @-@ policy responses .
to add insult to injury , we are now permitting a regulatory backlash against technological innovations that disrupt entrenched and inefficient industries , and that provide people with greater control over their lives and wellbeing .
growing restrictions on companies such as Airbnb and Uber hit the young particularly hard , both as producers and as consumers .
if we do not change course soon , subsequent generations will confront self @-@ reinforcing economic , financial , and political tendencies that burden them with too little growth , too much debt , artificially inflated asset prices , and alarming levels of inequality and partisan political polarization .
fortunately , we are aware of the mounting problem , worried about its consequences , and have a good sense of how to bring about the much @-@ needed pivot .
given the role of technological innovation , much of which is youth @-@ led , even a small reorientation of policies could have a meaningful and rapid impact on the economy .
through a more comprehensive policy approach , we could turn a vicious cycle of economic stagnation , social immobility , and market volatility into a virtuous cycle of inclusive growth , genuine financial stability , and greater political coherence .
what is needed , in particular , is simultaneous progress on pro @-@ growth structural reforms , better demand management , addressing pockets of excessive indebtedness , and improving regional and global policy frameworks .
while highly desirable , such changes will materialize only if greater constructive pressure is placed on politicians .
simply put , few politicians will champion changes that promise longer @-@ term benefits but often come with short @-@ term disruptions .
and the older voters who back them will resist any meaningful erosion of their entitlements - even turning , when they perceive a threat to their interests , to populist politicians and dangerously simplistic solutions such as Brexit .
sadly , young people have been overly complacent when it comes to political participation , notably on matters that directly affect their wellbeing and that of their children .
yes , almost three @-@ quarters of young voters backed the UK &apos;s &quot; Remain &quot; campaign .
but only a third of them turned out .
in contrast , the participation rate for those over 65 was more than 80 % . undoubtedly , the absence of young people at the polls left the decision in the hands of older people , whose preferences and motivations differ , even if innocently .
millennials have impressively gained a greater say in how they communicate , travel , source and disseminate information , pool their resources , interact with businesses , and much else .
now they must seek a greater say in electing their political representatives and in holding them accountable .
if they don &apos;t , my generation will - mostly inadvertently - continue to borrow excessively from their future .
a Prisoner &apos;s reflections on Nelson Mandela
Kharkiv - incarceration is said to leave you with a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability .
but the truth of life for a political prisoner , even for one on a hunger strike , is the opposite .
as a prisoner , I have been forced to focus on what is essential about myself , my political beliefs , and my country .
so I can almost feel the presence of the brave women and men , old and young , who have gathered in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities to defend their dreams of a democratic and European future .
in prison , your hopes and dreams become your reality .
I am sure that Nelson Mandela would have understood my feelings and agreed .
the South African apartheid regime may have locked him away for almost three decades , but in the great Soweto protests and the other demonstrations for freedom and equality , courageous young South Africans invariably looked to his example and felt his presence .
around the world , most people now rightly celebrate the gentle dignity with which Mandela led South Africa out of the political wilderness .
even here , behind prison bars and 24 @-@ hour surveillance of the type that he experienced for so long , I can conjure the warmth of his broad smile , merry eyes , and those colorful Hawaiian @-@ style shirts that he wore with such panache .
and I can admire his unyielding - and , yes , sometimes wily - commitment to reconciliation , which saved his country from the race war that those who refused to accept the end of white @-@ minority rule saw as inevitable .
how wrong they were , and how miraculous was Mandela &apos;s achievement in making even his most implacable enemies feel at home in post @-@ apartheid South Africa .
but here , in this place , it is not Mandela the statesman who touches my soul and fires my imagination .
&quot; my &quot; Mandela is the prisoner , the Mandela of Robben Island , who endured 27 years behind bars ( 18 of them on a rock in the South Atlantic ) and yet emerged with his spirit intact , brimming with a vision of a tolerant South Africa , a country liberated even for apartheid &apos;s architects and beneficiaries .
no purges marked the end of white rule .
there were no witch @-@ hunts , nor was there summary justice .
all that Mandela demanded was that the truth about the past be revealed .
through the unique innovation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission , Mandela found the only viable bridge between his country &apos;s racist legacy and its multi @-@ racial present and future - a combination of political genius and humane wisdom that only the greatest of leaders possess .
Mandela was able to guide South Africa to freedom , because he was able to see its future more clearly than those who lived through the apartheid years outside of prison .
indeed , he possessed that rare clarity of moral vision that prison - perhaps like no other environment - can nurture .
imprisonment brought Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn this clarity as well .
&quot; gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil passes not through states , nor between classes , nor between political parties , either - but right through every human heart - and through all human hearts , &quot; he wrote in The Gulag Archipelago .
&quot; this line shifts .... And even within hearts overwhelmed by evil , one small bridgehead of good is retained .
and even in the best of all hearts , there remains ... an un @-@ uprooted small corner of evil . &quot;
the ability to begin to see more clearly than most the inner workings of the human soul is one of the few gifts that imprisonment can bestow .
forced to reckon with your own vulnerability , isolation , and losses ( and seemingly lost cause ) , you learn to look more carefully into the human heart - yours and that of your jailers .
Mandela epitomized this rare gift .
how else could he have personally invited one of his Robben Island jailers to attend his inauguration as South Africa &apos;s first democratically elected president ?
of course , behind Mandela &apos;s generous spirit was a character of steel .
he bore his imprisonment for the sake of his cause .
and he bore the anguish of the suffering imposed on his family .
and yet he neither broke nor surrendered to the rage that would have consumed most people .
as usual , Mandela &apos;s own words about his day of personal liberation show how well he understood this : &quot; as I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom , I knew if I didn &apos;t leave my bitterness and hatred behind , I &apos;d still be in prison . &quot;
and just as Mandela knew in his prison cell that apartheid would one day fall , I know in my solitude that Ukraine &apos;s ultimate triumph as a European democracy is certain .
sweet Caroline in Tokyo
Tokyo - Fifty years have passed since the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy , with official ceremonies held in Washington , DC , and Dallas to commemorate the anniversary .
but JFK &apos;s eldest daughter , Caroline Kennedy , was not present at either event ; she had just taken up her post in Tokyo as the 29th US Ambassador to Japan .
on November 19 , thousands of people lined the streets to catch a glimpse of Kennedy as she made her way from Tokyo Station to the Imperial Palace , around a kilometer away , by horse @-@ drawn carriage to present her credentials to the emperor .
waving to the onlookers , she looked like Snow White .
November 22 , 1963 , was also the day satellite broadcasting from the United States to Japan began , and many Japanese got up early to watch a speech by JFK in Dallas that began at 5 : 30 a.m .
but , rather than airing the speech , the broadcast brought the shocking news of the assassination .
the image of young Caroline - the inspiration for Neil Diamond &apos;s famous song - solemnly standing beside her three @-@ year @-@ old brother as he saluted his father &apos;s coffin is deeply engrained in the hearts of Japan &apos;s people .
so there probably is not a single Japanese who would not welcome her as US Ambassador .
US ambassadors to Japan have come in three types .
there have been academic experts on Japan , like the acclaimed scholar Edwin Reischauer .
there have also been political heavyweights , such as Michael Mansfield , a long @-@ time Democratic majority leader of the US Senate , former Vice President Walter Mondale , former Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Foley , and Senator Howard Baker , who also served as President Ronald Reagan &apos;s chief of staff .
the third type are presidential political appointees , such as Thomas Schieffer , a former business partner of President George W. Bush , and John Roos , a noted Silicon Valley lawyer .
clearly , Caroline Kennedy , an important early supporter of President Barack Obama , is in this category .
indeed , her backing for Obama in the Democratic Party primaries in 2008 , when he was still a relatively unknown senator from Illinois , gave his campaign credibility among party insiders who remain loyal to her family &apos;s legacy .
Kennedy &apos;s address to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during her confirmation hearing elicited bipartisan support - a rare occurrence nowadays , given America &apos;s highly polarized national politics - and she received unanimous approval .
although she lacks formal political or diplomatic experience , her personal connections , particularly to Obama , will have great significance for US @-@ Japan relations .
and there are pressing issues that need the new ambassador &apos;s attention .
for example , there are security questions related to strengthening the alliance between Japan and the US , including the relocation of the Futenma Air Station , the base of operations for the US Marine Corps on Okinawa .
there are also issues related to economic cooperation , such as the Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , the proposed mega @-@ regional free @-@ trade treaty covering Pacific Rim economies .
although powerful domestic interest groups , particularly those representing the agricultural sector , have objected to Japanese participation in the TPP negotiations , Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &apos;s government chose to join the talks late in the day .
instead of banking the political capital that his high approval ratings had given him , he chose to spend some of it on an initiative that his predecessors had rejected , but that will help to transform myriad aspects of Japan &apos;s economy .
of course , given today &apos;s hyper @-@ partisan environment in the US , there is a danger that fast @-@ track negotiating authority - under which Congress binds itself to an up @-@ or @-@ down vote on trade agreements ( thereby precluding amendments and filibusters ) - will not be given to the president .
if this roadblock cannot be overcome and the agreement stalls , the Abe government &apos;s approval ratings will suffer , despite progress in the negotiations .
given the unanimity with which Kennedy was confirmed , she may be able to use her own political capital to help sell fast @-@ track authority in Congress .
the Abe government is banking on its high approval rating not only to participate in the TPP , but also to address the need to escape from 15 years of deflation and strengthen Japan &apos;s national @-@ security posture , which has been hamstrung for decades .
given the nexus of issues that tie vital US interests to Japan &apos;s reform process , Kennedy , with her character and skills , could well prove to be an essential link between the countries at a crucial point in their relationship .
who Lost Thailand ?
Tokyo - Thailand , Southeast Asia &apos;s most developed and sophisticated economy , is teetering on the edge of the political abyss .
yet most of the rest of Asia appears to be averting its eyes from the country &apos;s ongoing and increasingly anarchic unrest .
that indifference is not only foolish ; it is dangerous .
Asia &apos;s democracies now risk confronting the same harsh question that the United States faced when Mao Zedong marched into Beijing , and again when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ousted the Shah in Iran .
who , they will have to ask , lost Thailand ?
much of the world is wondering how such a successful economy could allow its politics to spin out of control .
what accounts for the armies of protesters - distinguished , gang @-@ like , by the color of their shirts - whose mutual antipathy often borders on nihilistic rage ?
the roots of the current unrest extend back more than a decade , to former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra &apos;s first electoral victory in 2001 .
Thaksin &apos;s triumph did not represent the normal alternation in power that one finds in a democracy .
instead , his victory heralded the political rise of the country &apos;s poor , long @-@ silenced rural majority .
Bangkok &apos;s entrenched elite recoiled in alarm .
but , instead of learning to compete with Thaksin for the votes of Thailand &apos;s rural poor , the country &apos;s urban elite ( including the powerful military ) sought to delegitimize his rule .
when he was re @-@ elected by an even larger majority , his government was overthrown , his political party was banned by the Supreme Court , and he was forced to flee the country after corruption charges against him led to a criminal conviction .
yet Thaksin &apos;s supporters did not abandon him .
when Thailand &apos;s military returned to their barracks , many Thai citizens voted for Thaksin at one remove , with his sister - Yingluck Shinawatra , a long @-@ time executive at Thaksin &apos;s communications firm - becoming Prime Minister , supported by a powerful parliamentary majority .
for much of her term in office , Yingluck garnered praise for her pragmatism , and for seeking to ameliorate the antagonism of her opponents .
but that praise and success appears to have bred a form of hubris .
she proposed an amnesty law that would have not only pardoned opposition leaders , including Abhisit Vejjajiva , her predecessor as prime minister ( who faces murder charges ) , but allowed her brother to return to the country .
and , in defiance of a Supreme Court ruling , she sought a constitutional amendment that would make the Senate , whose members are appointed , an elected body .
the opposition , sensing that its moment had arrived , launched a wave of street protests .
Yingluck , in an effort to defuse the situation , called for a parliamentary election in February .
but the opposition has rejected this and says that it will boycott the vote .
it fears - rightly , most people suspect - that the Thaksin camp will be returned to power in any free and fair vote .
so , in essence , what is happening in Thailand is an attempted nullification of democracy by the opposition and the country &apos;s entrenched elite .
unable to compete successfully with Thaksin for votes , they now want to dilute Thai democracy in order to prevent the electorate from ever again choosing a government that goes against their will .
if Thailand were an insignificant country with little geostrategic weight , its problems might not matter as much as they do to the rest of Asia .
but Thailand is Southeast Asia &apos;s lynchpin economy .
it is a key partner for Myanmar ( Burma ) as it makes its own political and economic transition , and it is a hub for trade with neighboring Cambodia , Laos , and Vietnam .
but the biggest reason that Thailand matters for Asia &apos;s democracies is fierce competition for influence between a rising China and the democratic world .
until now , Thailand has been a firm member of the democratic camp .
its military is mostly trained by the United States ; indeed , it was the key staging point for the US during the Vietnam War .
likewise , Japan and India have long regarded Thailand as a democratic bulwark in a neighborhood where some regimes - Cambodia and Laos - are firmly under China &apos;s hegemonic sway .
indeed , its government has proved to be a strong supporter of Myanmar &apos;s president , Thein Sein , as he seeks to free his country from China &apos;s tight embrace .
by standing aside as Thailand &apos;s opposition and traditional elite seek to undermine the country &apos;s democracy in the name of a permanent right to rule , Asia &apos;s democracies risk driving some elements of the Thaksin camp into the arms of China , which would happily accept the role of patron to so potent a political force .
but this need not happen .
Thailand &apos;s military has long and respectful ties not only with the US military , but with officers in Japan as well .
Thailand &apos;s opposition politicians , many of whom were educated at top Western universities , may also be open to quiet advice that they are pushing things too far , not only putting Thailand &apos;s stability at risk , but also jeopardizing regional security .
just as , a decade ago , the West objected to the efforts of Turkey &apos;s entrenched secular elite to rob Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s mildly Islamist AKP party of its democratic victory , it needs to speak clearly today in defense of Thai democracy .
the opposition &apos;s claim that it is acting in the interests of the world &apos;s democracies needs to be rebutted .
Thaksin may be no saint , and some constitutional reform will be needed if political reconciliation is to come about .
but Thaksin &apos;s governments , like that of his sister , have kept China at one remove from influence .
that is the key strategic interest that is now at stake .
should Yingluck be ousted in a coup , or should the country &apos;s democracy be hollowed out to preclude her return to power , the Shinawatras may be left with no choice but to seek support from Thailand &apos;s giant neighbor to the north .
if that happens , we will all know who lost Thailand .
we did .
equality or estrangement
Tokyo - Those whom the gods would destroy , they grant their wishes .
will that bit of ancient wisdom now hold for the United States and Japan ?
for a half @-@ century , the US , which wrote Japan &apos;s postwar &quot; peace &quot; constitution , has pressed the Japanese to play a greater role in maintaining Asian and global stability .
but now that Japan finally has a leader who agrees , the US is getting nervous , with Secretary of State John Kerry supposedly calling Japan under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe &quot; unpredictable . &quot;
these strains in the US @-@ Japan relationship - surely the foundation stone of Asian stability - first became noticeable in December , when Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo , which houses the &quot; souls &quot; of ( among others ) Class A war criminals from the Pacific War .
the US has always criticized Japanese officials &quot; visits to the shrine , but through diplomatic channels .
this time , America voiced its displeasure openly .
the US is rightly concerned about the negative impact of such pilgrimages on Japan &apos;s relations with its neighbors , particularly China and South Korea .
but the harsh tone publicly adopted by President Barack Obama &apos;s administration raised serious concerns among some in Abe &apos;s government who question Obama &apos;s commitment to the alliance and suspect that he was using the Yasukuni issue as a pretext to signal a weakening of America &apos;s defense commitment .
such suspicions were sharpened after China declared its new Air Defense Identification Zone , which overlaps Japanese sovereign territory .
the US tried to have it both ways : though the Obama administration sent US bombers through the new ADIZ to demonstrate its refusal to recognize China &apos;s move , it also told US commercial airliners to acknowledge the zone and report their flight plans to the Chinese authorities .
likewise , US acquiescence in China &apos;s de facto ouster of the Philippines from the Scarborough Shoal ( a disputed outcropping in the South China Sea ) raised questions in Japan about the two countries &quot; supposed harmony of interests .
in fact , although the US extols the virtues of its partnership with Japan , successive American presidents have been vague about the details .
ultimately , the idea always seemed to be that Japan would pay more for defense , but the US would set the partnership &apos;s objectives .
Abe &apos;s conception of the US @-@ Japan partnership presupposes much greater equality .
after all , a society like Japan , trying to escape two decades of economic malaise , cannot feel completely comfortable outsourcing its national @-@ security strategy , even to an ally that is as respected and reliable as the US .
far from being based on chest @-@ thumping nationalism , Abe &apos;s national @-@ security strategy reflects , above all , a deep awareness of how a lost generation of economic growth has affected the Japanese .
his bravura diplomatic performances sometimes give the impression that a self @-@ confident Japan has been a normal feature of the global landscape .
strangely , it is all but forgotten - particularly by the Chinese - that for two decades Japan has watched China &apos;s rise quietly from the sidelines ( even supportively , to the extent that Japanese investors have poured in billions of dollars in the three decades since Deng Xiaoping opened the economy ) .
indeed , Abe has succeeded so well in returning Japan to the world stage that his US and Asian critics act as if the only problem now is to moderate Japanese self @-@ confidence - a notion that would have been laughable just two years ago .
but the fact remains that one of Abe &apos;s primary worries is the spiritual malaise that accompanied Japan &apos;s long economic stagnation .
those who see in his patriotic rhetoric a desire to whitewash history miss his real concern : economic revival is meaningless if it does not secure Japan &apos;s position as a leading Asian power .
the US , however , regards Abe &apos;s worries about Japan &apos;s spirit as peripheral to its efforts to forge a lasting relationship with China and overhaul its strategic presence in the Pacific .
for example , the US views the Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership - the huge trade agreement involving it , Japan , and 10 other leading Pacific Rim countries - as a technical scheme that will bring economic benefits through greater trade .
but , for Abe , the TPP &apos;s value for Japan &apos;s sense of identity - that it is now a more outward @-@ looking nation - is just as important .
in Abe &apos;s view , Japan needs to regain , wherever possible , the right of independent decision @-@ making if it is to manage successfully the challenge posed to it by China .
this does not mean that Abe &apos;s Japan will become an ally like France under Jacques Chirac , spurning US leadership for the sake of it ; instead , Abe seeks a policy of cooperation with the US that reflects the alliance &apos;s voluntary nature .
he believes that , given the new balance of power in Asia , the alliance will be meaningful only if each partner has a real choice , and the wherewithal , to act autonomously or with regional allies .
fortunately , Japanese and American analyses of Chinese trends are not very different .
both generally view China as having embarked on a probing strategy in search of weak spots where it can expand its geopolitical reach .
and both believe that only when China is convinced that such probes will yield no lasting benefit can serious negotiations about a comprehensive security structure for Asia take place .
but even here , there is a difference .
the US , convinced of the importance of intentions in the conduct of foreign policy , believes that once China recognizes the limits to its power , a structure of peace will follow naturally .
Abe , by contrast , believes that only a favorable balance of power can be relied upon , and he is determined that Japan play its part in constructing that balance .
although Abe has lifted Japan &apos;s sights and self @-@ confidence , he recognizes that Japan faces real limits .
the US , too , should recognize that there are limits to the extent of the subordination that it can ask of an ally .
some wishes really are better left unfulfilled .
securing Japan
Tokyo - Shinzo Abe &apos;s second term as Japan &apos;s prime minister began with a laser @-@ like focus on economic revitalization .
that policy , almost instantly dubbed &quot; Abenomics , &quot; comprises what have been called the three &quot; arrows &quot; : bold monetary policy , an expansionary fiscal stance , and structural reforms to stimulate private investment .
hosting the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020 has added a fourth arrow to this quiver in the form of increased infrastructure investment and tourism revenue in the years leading up to the Games .
to be sure , after 15 years of deflationary recession , revitalization of the Japanese economy remains far from complete .
nonetheless , the effects of Abe &apos;s reforms are becoming visible in areas such as equity prices and exchange rates .
but Abe also confronts a security environment in Asia that is every bit as brittle as Japan &apos;s economy was before his government took office last December .
indeed , he confronted many of the same issues during his first administration seven years ago .
his efforts back then were halted by his own resignation , and he is now making a second attempt to establish a national @-@ security governance system to meet Japan &apos;s needs - and those of its allies - in twenty @-@ first @-@ century Asia .
in a speech to a plenary session of the lower house of Japan &apos;s Diet on October 25 , Abe emphasized that , given the current security situation in Asia , &quot; It is essential to strengthen command functions for implementing the prime minister &apos;s national security policy . &quot;
now that split control of the Diet &apos;s upper and lower houses has been resolved , with Abe &apos;s Liberal Democrats in strong control of both chambers , a bill to modernize Japan &apos;s national @-@ security governance is certain to pass .
the bill that Abe has submitted aims to establish a Japanese National Security Council , based on lessons from the successes and failures of similar institutions in other countries , such as the NSC in the United States .
the Security Council of Japan - something of a stopgap measure created to provide advice from relevant cabinet members to the prime minister in times of crisis - will now be reorganized as a formal institution .
the new NSC &apos;s membership will be limited to the prime minister , the cabinet secretary , and the foreign and defense ministers , with relevant ministers added on an ad hoc basis .
a permanent National Security Secretariat , headed by a person with abundant diplomatic experience , will be established in the prime minister &apos;s office , with 60 security specialists from various fields laying the policy groundwork for medium- and long @-@ term national security strategy .
this strategy will then be reflected in guidelines issued to Japan &apos;s defense bodies and diplomats .
Japan , like other countries , has faced jurisdictional disputes among foreign @-@ policy , defense , and police agencies that have hindered the aggregation and analysis of intelligence information .
but , with the creation of the NSC , each ministry and agency will report important national @-@ security information to the new secretariat , which will then carry out integrated analysis and issue reports to the prime minister and others .
of course , as in other countries , bureaucracies are creatures of habit .
as we can already see , it will not be easy to overcome the obstacles posed by vertically integrated ministries and agencies .
institutionalization will take time - and the importance of its success cannot be understated .
for example , the new NSC will be responsible for sharing intelligence with other countries , including the US , Japan &apos;s most important ally .
as a result , ensuring the protection of information will be a key issue , particularly given the old habit of leaking security information to the press .
that is why the Diet is also considering a bill on the protection of classified information that would impose harsher punishment on government officials who leak secrets , particularly those concerning national security .
the trauma of gag laws that were imposed on the press before and during World War II resulted in the elimination of all restraints afterwards , which had the effect of making Japan a spy &apos;s paradise , with insufficient counterintelligence measures and poor secrecy .
moreover , the long decades of peace since 1945 have served to lower awareness among politicians of the need for confidentiality .
for example , Japanese newspapers always report when , where , and with whom the Prime Minister met for dinner in the following day &apos;s editions .
in contrast to the US system of presidential government , Japan has a parliamentary form of government .
yet the goals of national security and crisis management are the same in both systems - indeed , one of British Prime Minister David Cameron &apos;s first acts when he came to power was to establish an NSC to improve coordination of policymaking .
although the establishment of the Japanese NSC is long overdue , it is not too late for Japan to benefit from the improvement in policy direction and coherence that it seems certain to bring .
how to End an Insurgency
Tokyo - When the Moro Islamic Liberation Front guerrilla movement took up arms in the Philippines in the 1960 &quot; s , Ferdinand Marcos had yet to become the country &apos;s president - let alone dictator .
despite the country &apos;s many political transformations in the last half @-@ century , the MILF &apos;s campaign to achieve independence for the Bangsamoro nation - whose territory , they claim , covers the islands of Mindanao , Palawan , Sulu , and Sabah - remained constant , until President Benigno Aquino III resolved to change it .
the MILF was not deterred by the popular overthrow of Marcos &apos;s 20 @-@ year dictatorship in 1986 , following the assassination of the opposition leader Benigno Aquino , Jr .
nor did the establishment of democracy - now deeply entrenched - inspire the group &apos;s leaders to reconsider their approach .
the MILF remained engaged in a brutal campaign of beheadings , assassination , kidnappings , and indiscriminate butchery .
then , last January , Aquino managed to achieve a landmark deal that finally ended Mindanao &apos;s agony .
this is one of the most remarkable feats of peacemaking in Asia since World War II , and at least as worthy of international recognition as former Finnish President and 2008 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Marti Ahtissari &apos;s role in brokering peace in Aceh , Indonesia , in 2005 .
in fact , given the myriad security and political risks that Aquino ran in concluding a peace deal with the MILF , he may be an even worthier Nobel laureate .
Aquino &apos;s approach to the negotiations reflected his recognition that the MILF had twice used peace talks - once brokered by Libya &apos;s Colonel Muammar el @-@ Qaddafi - as a cynical ploy to buy time to regroup and raise funds ( including from Al Qaeda ) . with freshly restocked arsenals , they would relaunch their campaign to seize Mindanao by force .
against this background , it is no surprise that , when Aquino relaunched stalled peace talks in 2012 , the Filipino people were highly skeptical .
but , over time , the effort gained credibility .
though questions about the peace agreement &apos;s durability remain , with full disarmament yet to take place , the political autonomy granted to the country &apos;s Muslim areas seems to have persuaded most MILF fighters that the time has come to end the carnage .
for the people of Mindanao , this is a life @-@ changing development .
in the few short months since the peace deal was reached , Filipino and foreign investment has been flowing into the island .
with nearly half of Mindanao &apos;s population living below the poverty line , these funds could not be more critical .
but the benefits of Aquino &apos;s leadership are not limited to Mindanao .
his entire presidency , which began in 2010 , has been characterized by the creativity and doggedness that made peace with the MILF possible .
whereas other Filipino leaders - including Aquino &apos;s mother , Corazon Aquino , who was elected president after Marcos &apos;s overthrow - spoke out against corruption , Aquino has attacked it at its roots .
he has brought to justice not only small @-@ time wrongdoers - or &quot; flies , &quot; as Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s calls such people - but also &quot; tigers &quot; like Senator Juan Ponce Enrile , who helped overthrow Marcos and bring Corazon Aquino to power two decades ago .
as a result , the Philippines has dramatically improved its ranking in Transparency International &apos;s annual corruption index , rising from a 134th @-@ place tie with Nigeria in 2010 , to 94th place , alongside India , last year .
Aquino &apos;s efforts to fight corruption and rebuild his country &apos;s economic foundations has enabled the Philippines - at long last - to become Southeast Asia &apos;s fastest @-@ growing economy , with annual GDP growth of 7.2 % last year .
while growth is expected to slow slightly this year , to 6.5 % , the Philippines can now be counted among Asia &apos;s &quot; tiger &quot; economies .
of course , the country still has a long way to go .
some ten million Filipinos - one @-@ quarter of the workforce ­ - ­ are compelled to seek employment overseas , owing to inadequate opportunities at home .
if the Philippines is to attract enough investment to achieve living standards comparable to Malaysia and Thailand , Aquino must remain persistent in his efforts to open the economy and curtail corruption .
fortunately , he seems determined to do so .
Aquino &apos;s foreign policy has also been characterized by the same resoluteness .
nowhere is this more apparent than in his willingness to stand up to China &apos;s territorial claims in the South China Sea .
indeed , the Philippines is challenging China &apos;s claims in the International Court of Arbitration , using provisions from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea .
Aquino &apos;s stern criticism of China &apos;s expansionist policies has certainly not endeared him to the Chinese .
but regional powers like the United States and Japan have supported his stance , with Japan promising to deliver enhanced equipment for the Philippine Coast Guard .
and the Filipino people undoubtedly appreciate his tenacity in protecting their interests .
Aquino &apos;s success in bringing the decades @-@ old MILF rebellion to a peaceful end highlights a courage and tenacity that will enable him to play a key role in reining in China &apos;s regional ambitions .
just as David &apos;s ingenuity enabled him , against all odds , to defeat Goliath , Aquino &apos;s bold and calculated leadership can succeed in bolstering stability and security throughout Asia by bringing China , perhaps against its will , into a rules @-@ based regional order .
Japan &apos;s Russian Dilemma
Tokyo - For Japanese leaders and citizens , President Vladimir Putin &apos;s brutal annexation of Crimea was an unsurprising return to the normal paradigm of Russian history .
indeed , most Japanese regard the move as having been determined by some expansionist gene in Russia &apos;s political DNA , rather than by Putin himself or the specifics of the Ukraine crisis .
Japan is particularly concerned with Russian expansionism , because it is the only G @-@ 7 country that currently has a territorial dispute with Russia , which has occupied its Northern Territories since the waning days of World War II .
that occupation began between August 28 and September 5 , 1945 , when the Soviet Union hurriedly nullified the existing Soviet @-@ Japanese neutrality Treaty and invaded not only Japanese @-@ occupied Manchuria , but also southern Sakhalin Island and the ancient Japanese territories of Etorofu Island , Kunashiri Island , Shikotan Island , and the Habomai Islands .
concerned that America &apos;s development and use of atomic weapons against Japan would deprive the Soviet Union of any territorial gains in the east , Stalin ordered the Red Army to invade .
but Japan , having already endured the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , had accepted the Potsdam Declaration on August 14 , meaning that the war was already over when the Red Army marched in .
since then , these islands have been controlled by either the Soviet Union or its successor state , Russia .
and , as elsewhere in Russia , their residents have been impoverished by consistently incompetent and corrupt government , whether run by Communists or today &apos;s crony capitalists .
in a strange historical twist , given the Crimean annexation , after the Japanese citizens native to the Northern Territories were killed or expelled , many Ukrainians were brought to the islands during the Soviet years , and still live there .
if an independence referendum were to be held on Etorofu Island , where some 60 % of the inhabitants have roots in Ukraine , I wonder whether Putin would accept the result as readily as he did the ballot in Crimea , undertaken at the barrel of a gun ?
after coming to power at the end of 2012 , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had sought to improve relations with Putin in the hope of beginning serious talks on the Northern Territories .
but now that Putin has made his project of imperial restoration crystal clear , those hopes are stillborn .
recognizing this , Abe condemned the annexation of Crimea , calling it &quot; a violation of Ukraine &apos;s integrity and the integrity of its sovereignty and territory . &quot;
Abe added that &quot; attempts to change the status quo by force cannot be overlooked , &quot; and that Japan would consider further economic sanctions against Russia in cooperation with the G @-@ 7 .
needless to say , these remarks underscored the fact that Japanese territory and territorial waters are being threatened &quot; by force &quot; in the East China Sea by China .
the lesson now being drawn is that , where territorial disputes are concerned , Japan must not kowtow to &quot; attempts to change the status quo backed by force . &quot;
China &apos;s response to the crisis in Ukraine was particularly revealing .
for three decades , China has proclaimed &quot; non @-@ interference &quot; in the internal affairs of sovereign states as the most important rule governing international relations .
but when Putin invaded Ukraine , China showed the hollowness of its adherence to this principle . instead of condemning Russia for invading and annexing Crimea , it abstained at the United Nations Security Council , and has offered more criticism of Ukraine &apos;s new popular government than it has of Putin &apos;s thuggish behavior .
every country in Asia is bound to draw only one conclusion from China &apos;s tacit approval of Putin &apos;s Crimean land grab : China , too , thinks that might makes right , and if it believes that it can get away with invading disputed territories , whether in the South China Sea or in the Indian Himalayas , it will do so .
as a result , effective deterrence will require Asian countries to strengthen their defenses and unite to demand adherence to international law , so that China understands that any Putin @-@ style land grabs will cost its economy dearly .
in the immediate future , Japan will work with the G @-@ 7 to ensure that Putin &apos;s reckless ambitions do not endanger other parts of Ukraine .
already , Japan has decided to provide ¥ 150 billion ( $ 1.5 billion ) in economic aid for Ukraine , the largest pledge by any individual country , including the US , thus far .
before the Crimea invasion , territorial negotiations between Japan and Russia showed signs of progress .
moreover , several bilateral economic cooperation efforts , such as projects involving liquefied natural gas , were moving forward .
but it is now clear not only that Putin is returning Russia to the stagnation of the late @-@ Soviet era , but also that he subscribes to former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev &apos;s dictum that &quot; what we have , we hold . &quot;
so Putin &apos;s talk about reaching an agreement with Japan on the Northern Territories was likely as mendacious as his claims that Russians in Crimea were in peril , and thus in need of protection by Russian troops .
more important , Japan understands that business as usual with an aggressive Russia that undermines the international order could embolden others closer to home to embrace Putin &apos;s lawless tactics .
the days of an inward looking Japan are over .
Japan now sees threats elsewhere in the world in the context of its own security , and will react appropriately .
Abenomics &quot; Women Problem
Tokyo - When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addressed the United Nations General Assembly last week , he emphasized his determination to build a society in which women shine .
indeed , creating opportunities for women in the workforce is an essential pillar of the government &apos;s reform program , so @-@ called &quot; Abenomics . &quot;
Abe is clearly on the right track .
according to an analysis by researchers at Goldman Sachs , closing the gender gap could boost GDP by 9 % in the United States and nearly 13 % in Japan .
during his stay in New York , Abe also discussed &quot; womenomics &quot; with Hillary Clinton , who had made empowering women in the economy a key policy goal during her tenure as US Secretary of State .
Abe , strange to say , is the first Japanese leader to grasp that the underutilization of women &apos;s skills has been holding back Japan &apos;s economy .
Japan ranked 105th out of 136 countries in the World Economic Forum &apos;s &quot; Global Gender Gap Report 2013 , &quot; down from 101st place in 2012 .
the problem begins in Abe &apos;s own domain - politics .
in his cabinet reshuffle earlier this month , five female ministers were appointed , but in the face of strong opposition from male MPs .
more important , the appointments amounted to painting over the cracks : only 39 of the 480 members of the Japanese Diet &apos;s lower house , or 7.9 % , are women .
the Inter @-@ Parliamentary Union ranks Japan 158th out of 189 countries in terms of its ratio of female MPs .
things are just as bad at lower levels of government , where women account for a mere 13.1 % of representatives in local parliaments , more than 40 % of which have no female members at all .
as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party , Abe should instruct local party branches to choose more female candidates to run in next April &apos;s local elections .
but , at least so far , Abe seems to lack the will to do so ( though he may choose to work with local party bosses behind the scenes to bring in more women ) .
it is also worrying that some of the women Abe has selected for his cabinet and for key party posts are arch @-@ conservatives who advocate that women stay at home and take care of children .
given this , one cannot help feeling uncertain about the credibility of his womenomics initiatives .
that is especially true when one considers the lack of women in corporate management positions .
everyone at the meeting of the Keidanren , the Federation of Economic Organizations , to welcome US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy were men in dark suits .
in 2003 , Norway revised its corporation law to state that companies that failed to place women in 40 % of management positions could face delisting .
if the same law were applied to Japan today , every company would be delisted .
women currently hold an estimated 9 % of senior management positions in Japan , compared to 40 % in the Philippines , 24 % in France , and 22 % in the United States .
one reason that Japan &apos;s consumer electronics manufacturers are no longer world @-@ beaters is that they have not fully used their female employees in managerial positions , despite their varied experiences .
the exceptions are instructive .
when Akira Matsumoto became CEO of the Japanese snack manufacturer Calbee , he began appointing both female executives and foreigners to the company &apos;s leadership .
revenues and earnings have increased , and net sales have grown threefold .
though there is no proof that the former caused the latter , Matsumoto &apos;s commitment to lead in this area suggests that corporate dynamism may well increase with a more prominent role for women .
likewise , Daiwa Securities CEO Shigeharu Suzuki has appointed women as executive officers to improve sales capabilities , with promising results .
although the employment rate of women in Japan reached 69.5 % in 2013 , more than 60 % of women leave the workplace prematurely , mostly owing to childbirth .
this pattern results from institutional impediments to achieving a viable work @-@ family balance - impediments that embody the harsh view of male superiors and colleagues toward working mothers .
changing this view is not easy , because the Confucian belief that women belong in the home remains embedded in Japanese and some other Asian societies .
moreover , most of the people participating in forums or workshops focused on womenomics are women ; too often , these events simply turn into platforms for women to complain among themselves .
Abe &apos;s womenomics will not work unless and until Japanese men change their thinking .
if Abenomics is now stalling , as many fear , the reason may be found in a lack of capacity to implement the policies put forward , particularly with respect to women .
indeed , the key to Abenomics &quot; success or failure may turn out to be whether the Japanese people are convinced that women are essential to their country &apos;s economic revival , and are willing to support an earnest effort to establish institutions that support working women .
tipping points to Asia &apos;s Future
Tokyo - A week , it is said , is a long time in politics .
but events in Asia over the past week may define the region for decades to come .
Thailand , one of Asia &apos;s most prosperous countries , seems determined to render itself a basket case .
a military coup , imposed following the Thai constitutional court &apos;s ouster of an elected government on spurious legal grounds , can lead only to an artificial peace .
unless Thailand &apos;s military is prepared to serve as a truly honest broker between deposed Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ( and her supporters ) and the anti @-@ democratic Bangkok elite , which has sought a right to permanent minority rule , today &apos;s calm may give way to a new and more dangerous storm .
to Thailand &apos;s east , Vietnam is the latest Asian country to feel pinched by China &apos;s policy of creating facts on the ground , or in this case at sea , to enhance its sovereignty claims on disputed territory .
Vietnam &apos;s government reacted vigorously to China &apos;s placement of a huge , exploratory oilrig near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea . ordinary Vietnamese , taking matters into their own hands , reacted even more vigorously , by rioting and targeting Chinese industrial investments for attack .
China &apos;s unilateral behavior has exposed a strain of virulent anti @-@ Chinese sentiment bubbling beneath the surface in many Asian countries .
renewed protests over China &apos;s mining investments in Myanmar this week confirmed this trend , one that China &apos;s leaders seem either to dismiss as trivial , or to regard as somehow unrelated to their bullying .
indeed , like Russian President Vladimir Putin , who faces widespread public antipathy in Ukraine , China &apos;s leaders appear to believe that popular protests against them can only be the product of an American plot .
yet , despite their shared contempt for expressions of the popular will , China &apos;s President Xi Jinping and Putin struggled , during Putin &apos;s two @-@ day visit to Shanghai , to agree on a new gas deal that the Kremlin desperately needs .
Putin had viewed China as his backup option should the West seek to isolate Russia following its annexation of Crimea .
Putin &apos;s idea was that he could pivot Russia &apos;s economy into a partnership with China .
but Xi balked , signing the gas agreement only after Putin offered a steep , long @-@ term discount .
Xi &apos;s self @-@ confidence reflected not only the Chinese leadership &apos;s contempt for Putin &apos;s mismanagement of the Russian economy , but also the fact that China &apos;s energy worries have lessened considerably of late .
successful deployment of hydraulic fracturing ( &quot; fracking &quot; ) technology in Xinjiang suggests that China , like America , will soon be able to draw on its own reserves of shale energy .
moreover , plentiful gas supplies from Myanmar and Central Asia will provide China with sufficient supplies of energy for at least a decade .
China &apos;s hard bargaining with Russia has exposed the limits of the two countries &quot; bilateral cooperation , which has important geo @-@ strategic consequences for Asia and the world .
China , it now seems , is happy to see Putin poke his finger in the West &apos;s eye and challenge America &apos;s global leadership .
but it is not willing to underwrite with hard cash Russian pretensions to world power status .
instead , China appears interested in turning Russia into the sort of vassal state that Putin is seeking to create in Ukraine .
but the most epochal events of the last week took place in two of Asia &apos;s great democracies : India and Japan .
Narendra Modi &apos;s landslide victory in India &apos;s general election was not only a huge personal triumph for the son of a tea seller , but may well mark a decisive break with India &apos;s traditional inward @-@ looking policies .
Modi is determined to reform India &apos;s economy and lead the country into the front rank of world powers .
here , Modi will find no stauncher ally than Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who was among the first Asian leaders to embrace him in his bid to lead India .
given that both countries have almost perfectly aligned regional security interests , there should be plenty of scope for the two to act in tandem to improve regional security and mutual prosperity .
Thailand &apos;s crisis might well mark a good early test of their ability to work together , because both countries have strong interests in Thailand &apos;s rapid return to democracy and the credibility needed to act as an honest broker in ending the country &apos;s crisis .
in the past week , Abe created for himself considerably more political space to act as a strategic partner , not only to India , but also to Japan &apos;s other allies , particularly the United States .
quietly , a panel appointed by Abe &apos;s government this week offered a reinterpretation of a key element of Article 9 of Japan &apos;s constitution .
for the first time since the Pacific War &apos;s end in 1945 , Japan &apos;s Self @-@ Defense Forces would be able to participate in &quot; collective self @-@ defense &quot; - meaning that Japan could come to the aid of its allies should they come under attack .
of course , China and others in Asia have tried to muddy this change with the alarmist charge of a return to Japanese militarism .
but the new interpretation of Article 9 augurs just the opposite : it embeds Japan &apos;s military within an alliance system that has been , and will remain , the backbone of Asia &apos;s prevailing structure of peace .
Abe will make this clear when he delivers the keynote address in Singapore at this year &apos;s Shangri La Dialogue , the annual meeting of Asian military and civilian military leaders .
Modi &apos;s victory and Abe &apos;s increased ability to stand by Japan &apos;s allies can help to forge deeper bilateral ties and , if properly understood by China , foster a greater strategic equilibrium in the region .
it is now possible for Asia &apos;s greatest powers - China , India , Japan , and the US - to form something akin to the concert system that gave Europe a century of almost complete peace in the nineteenth century .
of course , such a system would require China to set aside its goal of regional hegemony .
clear @-@ sighted Chinese must already see that , short of a victorious war , such dominance is impossible .
now is the moment for China to anchor its rise within a stable and mutually acceptable Asian regional order .
indeed , for China , this may be the ultimate tipping point in its modernization .
the Road to Slovyansk
Tokyo - The Ukraine crisis has demonstrated that one person alone can endanger world peace .
but that one person might not be Russian President Vladimir Putin , who in reality only leads a large regional power that , owing to his authoritarian rule and muddled economics , is a long @-@ term threat more to itself than to the world .
no , the lone actor most responsible for threatening world peace might unwittingly be US President Barack Obama , with his scholarly inertia and apparent disregard for the fate of smaller , faraway countries .
of course , Obama is not responsible for Russia &apos;s invasion and annexation of Crimea , or for Putin &apos;s massing of Russian troops on Ukraine &apos;s eastern border in an effort to intimidate the government in Kyiv .
nor is Obama alone in crafting a Western policy of appeasement by default .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also bears considerable responsibility : her tough rhetoric masks a largely business @-@ as @-@ usual approach that reflects her country &apos;s dependence on Russian gas supplies .
but Obama is responsible for his administration &apos;s apparent indifference to the fate of the American @-@ built order that has governed world affairs since the end of World War II .
unless he toughens his policies , the rules and norms that have guaranteed peace for so many for so long could lose their force .
the utter disconnect between America &apos;s diplomatic principles and practice has become so great that it is emboldening the country &apos;s adversaries .
that is why , following Russia &apos;s illegal seizure and annexation of Crimea , Putin is now trying to mold Ukraine &apos;s eastern provinces into vassal regions , if not foment irredentism , in order to realize his dream of reconstituting the Russian empire .
but it is not only America &apos;s rivals who are taking note of Obama &apos;s passivity .
the United States &quot; closest allies are also watching nervously , and the conclusions they appear to be drawing could harm its national security interests severely in the years and decades to come .
consider the Middle East , where Saudi Arabia is already openly questioning the reliability of the Kingdom &apos;s historic US defense guarantee .
and US Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s &quot; guidance &quot; for a settlement of the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict , which should have been unveiled this month , will now remain under wraps .
speculation abounded that Kerry &apos;s proposal would contain a specific US guarantee of Israel &apos;s borders .
but can anyone imagine Israelis taking America at its word after watching the US dither while Russia redrew the map of Ukraine ?
in the Budapest Memorandum of 1994 , the US , together with the United Kingdom and Russia , guaranteed Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity in exchange for its surrender of the large nuclear arsenal it inherited from the Soviet Union .
now that the US has disregarded its obligation to Ukraine - reportedly unwilling even to share intelligence with its government on Russian troop movements , much less supply the country with the means to defend itself - all bets are off concerning an American guarantee of Israel &apos;s security and territorial integrity .
for that matter , why should Iran discontinue its nuclear program when it sees the ease with which Ukraine was dismembered ?
after all , the Iranians have borne far harsher sanctions than those imposed on Russia so far .
by acquiescing in Russia &apos;s seizure of Crimea , the US may also see core alliances begin to unravel .
for example , the US has openly stated that it will defend Japan should China forcibly seize the disputed Senkaku Islands .
but if America can evade its guarantee of Ukraine &apos;s territorial integrity , why should Japan &apos;s leaders believe that it will do otherwise in the case of a far @-@ flung cluster of uninhabited islands that are scarcely more than rocks inhabited by sheep ?
US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel heard an earful of official doubt about the credibility of America &apos;s defense commitment during his recent visit to Japan .
Obama is certain to hear more of the same in Tokyo this week .
of course , the US is no longer in a position to &quot; pay any price ... to secure the survival and the success of liberty , &quot; as John F. Kennedy put it in his inaugural address - not in Ukraine , and not anywhere else .
the huge price of its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has understandably made the US war @-@ weary .
moreover , no country has the right to expect Americans to fight and die on its territory for its freedom .
but has the US become so withdrawn from the world that it is willing to pay only a symbolic price , such as that implied by Russia &apos;s tit @-@ for @-@ tat sanctions , to stop aggression that threatens the international order ?
have America &apos;s recent foreign wars so scarred its leaders that they are unable to defend the world order that their predecessors created and for which many Americans have died ?
the time is growing short for the US to demonstrate anew - to friend and foe alike - that its word remains its bond .
unless Russia honors the accord recently reached in Geneva to defuse the Ukraine crisis , the US must use - and soon - its full arsenal of non @-@ military means to demonstrate to Putin the costs , and folly , of his 1930 &quot; s @-@ style revanchism .
the soft underbelly of Putin &apos;s imperial ambitions is Russia &apos;s brittle and undiversified economy , and the expectations of ordinary Russians for improved living standards .
the US and the European Union need to demonstrate clearly to the Russian people that their president &apos;s policies will mean a likely return to the poverty and tyranny of the Soviet era .
any lesser display of resolve may fatally weaken the bedrock of Western security - and that of the world .
the Pyongyang purge
Tokyo - During the Cold War , the term &quot; Kremlinology &quot; referred to efforts to understand what was taking place at the commanding heights of the Soviet Union - indeed , behind the entire Iron Curtain .
Kremlinologists monitored ( in whatever way possible ) who was up and who was down among the core Soviet leadership .
great significance was read into who signed an official document , or who stood where atop Lenin &apos;s Tomb in Red Square when reviewing military parades .
all of that was grammar @-@ school stuff compared to efforts to decipher the regime in North Korea , where the truth is far more opaque .
consider what happened on December 17 .
Choe Ryong @-@ hae , Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Korean Workers &quot; Party , was conspicuously present on stage at the commemoration of the second anniversary of &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong @-@ il &apos;s death - the first major ceremony following the purge and execution of Jang Song @-@ thaek , the former vice chairman of the National Defense Commission .
Choe &apos;s speech , with its threats against the United States and South Korea , seemed to set the stage for his political elevation .
Jang Song @-@ thaek had been seen as a kind of regent to Kim Jong @-@ un , the young successor to the Kim family dynasty , and was thought to be number two in the regime .
but he owed his position to his wife , Kim Kyong @-@ hui , the only sister of Kim Jong @-@ il , Kim Jong @-@ un &apos;s deceased father .
Jang &apos;s tact , as well as his usefulness as an interlocutor with China , enabled him to keep his position , despite his long @-@ term separation from his wife .
but in North Korea , blood is paramount : everything , including ideology and the national interest , is subservient to the maintenance of the Kim dynasty .
the &quot; legacy &quot; of the &quot; Great Leader &quot; Kim Il @-@ sung and his son , &quot; Dear Leader &quot; Kim Jong @-@ il , determines all major decisions .
I have long believed that the true holder of power since Kim Jong @-@ il &apos;s death has been his sister , Kim Kyong @-@ hui , and no one else .
North Korean culture would suggest that women do not take positions of leadership , but it appears that she was the only family member whom Kim Jong @-@ il could trust .
when he was incapacitated by illness , it was she who called the shots .
her blood tie to the Kim dynasty is the reason why , even after her husband was purged and executed ( and the rest of his family rounded up ) , she maintained her political position .
it has even been suggested that she made the decision to purge her husband .
though it cannot be known whether she also proposed killing him , it is not surprising that she believed that , with her own health failing , she could not leave the family dynasty to her husband &apos;s care .
perhaps the most chilling aspect of Jang &apos;s execution is that it appears to be part of a feeding frenzy that has claimed the lives of a number of senior officials and generals .
and the bloodletting has been extremely personal : in August , Kim Jong @-@ un reportedly ordered the execution by firing squad of an ex @-@ girlfriend and other members of her musical ensemble ; the killings are said to have been carried out in front of their families .
elsewhere in the communist world , such murderous purges were renounced long ago , first in the Soviet Union by Khrushchev , following his denunciation of Stalin , and then in China by Deng Xiaoping , following his rehabilitation and return to power in the late 1970 &quot; s .
this &quot; reform &quot; did not make these regimes any more beneficent or efficient , but it did bring a degree of stability and predictability to their behavior .
North Korea , always the least predictable of totalitarian communist states , remains in a twilight world .
more disturbing is the question of whether China is going down a parallel path under President Xi Jinping .
ever since Deng &apos;s rule , there has been an understanding that members of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s Politburo are not to be touched , even in retirement .
but Xi , under the pretext of his anti @-@ corruption battle , has targeted retired Politburo member Zhou Yongkang , who is now reportedly under house arrest , facing graft charges - and lurid allegations not only that he murdered his first wife but that he tried to assassinate Xi .
China &apos;s emphasis since Deng on rule by consensus may not have made the country any more democratic , but it at least prevented the re @-@ emergence of a new cult of personality à la Mao Zedong .
the question today is whether Xi &apos;s flouting of this internal party convention is another step in re @-@ creating one @-@ man - and thus completely arbitrary - rule in China .
in North Korea , of course , arbitrary rule - no matter how bizarre and inept - is always the norm .
and now , with Jang purged , responsibility for economic failure in North Korea has been shifted to Choe .
all officials and people related to him now live under the shadow of the executioner , for he is certain to bear the blame when the dynasty needs a scapegoat for its mounting problems .
and Jang &apos;s purge may make those problems worse .
while China lost a convenient point of contact with the Kim regime , North Korea may have lost the only channel by which to sustain itself .
the economy cannot be revived so long as international sanctions are maintained , and the sanctions seem certain to remain in place so long as the regime continues with its nuclear brinkmanship .
China , which has been the Kim dynasty &apos;s lifeline , no longer appears willing to offer it a blank check .
so the day is fast approaching when Kim Jong @-@ un and his clan will have to take responsibility for the country &apos;s dire condition , and it may come soon after Kim Kyong @-@ hui dies .
if so , the Kim dynasty &apos;s last chapter may have begun with the current spasm of executions , though the ending - for the Korean Peninsula and East Asia alike - remains very much in doubt .
the New neutrality
Tokyo - Throughout the Cold War , the Soviet Union used every imaginable threat and inducement - including the ultimate prize of reunification - to bring about a neutral Germany .
but German leaders of both the left and the right , from Konrad Adenauer to Willy Brandt , spurned every Soviet offer .
will authoritarian mercantilism now succeed where communism failed ?
countries join alliances , or entities such as the European Union , because these groups make the benefits and obligations of membership as unambiguous as anything in international relations can be .
for Germany and South Korea , however , relationships with historic allies - NATO and the United States , respectively - appear to be changing before our eyes .
through their huge purchases of goods , with promises of even more to come , today &apos;s authoritarian / mercantilist regimes in Russia and China may be about to achieve by commerce what the Soviets could not achieve by bribery and threats .
and the scale of that commerce is breathtaking , with German exports to China growing from $ 25.9 billion a decade ago to $ 87.6 billion in 2011 , while South Korea &apos;s exports have increased from $ 53 billion to $ 133 billion during the same period of time .
a form of stealth neutralism , indeed , appears to be entering both countries &quot; diplomacy .
witness Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s recent trip to South Korea , German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s unwillingness to impose effective sanctions on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine , and the business @-@ only focus of her just @-@ concluded visit to China .
in both Germany and South Korea , the idea that historic alliances may offer fewer tangible benefits than tacit neutrality - particularly in terms of exports - appears to be taking root , especially among business elites .
Xi &apos;s visit to Seoul was another bold step in China &apos;s systematic efforts to wean South Korea from its commitment to the US @-@ led international economic order .
by offering to permit South Korea to settle its bilateral trade accounts in renminbi , and to launch the first @-@ ever Sino @-@ South Korean initiative toward North Korea , Xi is seeking to convince South Korea &apos;s leaders that the country &apos;s future , including reunification , will be determined in Beijing .
China &apos;s invitation to South Korea to participate in a new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( alongside other countries in Asia and the Arab world , but excluding Japan and India ) furthers Xi &apos;s efforts to create an alternative financial system , with the AIIB mimicking the Asia Development Bank &apos;s work .
China &apos;s embrace of South Korea is part of a long @-@ term strategy to turn it into a subordinate state in terms of foreign and national security policy ( much as Finland kowtowed to the Soviet Union throughout the Cold War ) .
and yet , though courted by all sides in the struggle to maintain stability in Northeast Asia , South Korea now runs the risk of becoming isolated .
every gesture by the South toward one of the protagonists - China , the US , Japan , and North Korea - elicits so much pressure by the others that its government must then somehow devise a compensatory policy .
for example , following President Park Geun @-@ hye &apos;s request that Xi honor the Korean assassin of a Japanese prime minister , to which Xi readily agreed , she began to discuss joining the US @-@ led Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership free @-@ trade negotiations , in order to assuage the US .
as China continued to pursue an anti @-@ Japanese propaganda campaign throughout 2013 , Park felt obliged to make some effort to revive ties with Japan by sending a private envoy to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to seek talks on reconciling their disputes .
given its insecurity , a by @-@ product of the Korean Peninsula &apos;s long division , South Korea requires , above all , calm and steady partners .
but frequent changes in US policy toward Northeast Asia in recent years have disoriented South Korean policymakers , while Chinese policy , though consistent , confronts South Korea &apos;s leaders with choices that they appear unprepared to make .
as a result , South Korea &apos;s elite appears to be splitting into pro @-@ Chinese and pro @-@ American factions that transcend party lines .
over a period of time , the only beneficiaries are likely to be those who call for &quot; Finlandization &quot; of the Korean peninsula .
meanwhile , the impact on German foreign policy of the country &apos;s deepening economic ties with Russia has been evident throughout the Ukraine crisis .
though Merkel frequently admonished the Kremlin about its intervention in Ukraine , German public opinion - particularly that of the country &apos;s business leaders - tied her hands .
indeed , German big businesses have been the main obstacle to imposing the type of systemic sanctions that might have dissuaded Russian President Vladimir Putin from annexing Crimea and continuing to back the insurgency ( which Russia itself incited ) in eastern Ukraine .
this is not the only recent case in which Germany has distanced itself from its allies and partners .
in Libya in 2011 , Germany refused to offer even rudimentary material support to the military intervention staged by its British and French allies .
Germany has also continuously failed to meet its commitment to spend 2 % of its GDP on defense , at the same time that it has insisted that troubled EU economies stick to austerity budgets that limit their deficits to a fixed proportion of their economic output .
indeed , throughout the eurozone crisis , Germany did the absolute minimum - and always at the last possible moment - to assist its EU partners .
and German leaders &quot; obsession with maintaining their country &apos;s &quot; golden decade &quot; of exports appears to have gagged them on topics like China &apos;s human rights abuses and its aggressive behavior toward its Asian neighbors .
that silence is being rewarded with the first @-@ ever joint cabinet sessions between a democracy and a communist dictatorship , which will take place in Berlin this autumn .
in both Germany and South Korea , economic strength seems to have produced an illusion of policy independence that is opening a chasm between the two countries and their allies - a chasm that revelations of US spying , on Merkel in particular , have deepened .
Germany and South Korea , however , will gain little , and risk much , if they downgrade their alliance ties in favor of commercially motivated , if unofficial , neutrality .
whatever short @-@ term benefits they receive will be more than offset by their strategic vulnerabilities vis @-@ à @-@ vis Russia and China .
ending East Asia &apos;s History Wars
Tokyo - Georges Clemenceau , who , as France &apos;s prime minister , led his country to victory in World War I , famously said that &quot; war is too important to be left to the generals . &quot;
Japan is now discovering that history is too important to be left to newspaper editors .
in the 1990s , the newspaper Asahi Shimbun caused a firestorm at home and in South Korea by publishing a series of articles , based upon testimony by the former Japanese soldier Seiji Yoshida , on &quot; comfort women &quot; - Koreans forced to provide sexual services to the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II .
Asahi has now admitted that the soldier &apos;s confessions were unfounded , and has disavowed the core supporting evidence for the articles .
that retraction appears to be causing as much embarrassment - and diplomatic vitriol - in Japan and South Korea today as the original series did .
but , at a time when both countries cannot afford to permit partisan or sloppy abuses of history to roil their bilateral relations , Asahi &apos;s careless work has turned out to be more than abysmal journalism ; it has introduced a dangerous element into regional diplomacy .
some say that Japan and South Korea should follow the example set by France and Germany .
reconciling in the first two decades following the Nazi Occupation of France , these countries &quot; leaders understood that their security and economic ties were far too important to their citizens &quot; wellbeing to allow the old hatreds to fester .
they knew that the unimaginable violence of WWII was a direct result of the antagonisms that had festered since the Napoleonic Wars and that were allowed to persist after 1918 .
in Charles de Gaulle and Konrad Adenauer , France and Germany had two of the twentieth century &apos;s greatest statesmen , leaders who were able to discern the broad sweep of history through the fog of quotidian politics .
their loyalty was not only to the citizens who elected them , but also to the generations of the past that had endured the consequences of Franco @-@ German enmity , and to generations yet to come , which would benefit from reconciliation .
of course , given that Japan and Korea have not fought a series of wars against each other , their relationship is not the same as that between Germany and France .
but it is clear that no one will benefit from a new round of heated historical debate .
to avoid this , political leaders like de Gaulle and Adenauer are needed .
only when we can discuss the past without endangering the future will the countries of Northeast Asia be able to establish a truly durable structure of peace .
as Admiral Dennis C. Blair , a former commander of the US Pacific Fleet , stated at a recent conference , &quot; The history of Asia from the 1930s to about 1955 or so was not pretty in any way .... I don &apos;t think any country can have a monopoly on righteousness , or on guilt and shame &quot; for that time .
Blair added that &quot; the attempt to hold a &apos; we were right &quot; and &apos; you were wrong &quot; sweepstakes is not going to help our children and grandchildren understand what happened there . &quot;
Japan and South Korea need to take responsibility for the future , not obsess about the past .
a recent Japanese government white paper called South Korea the country &quot; that shares the closest relationship with Japan historically and in areas such as economy and culture . &quot;
no doubt , many , if not most , South Korean foreign @-@ policy experts and strategists share that sentiment .
but it will take committed leadership to transcend the history wars and tap the full potential of Japanese @-@ Korean cooperation , something that both countries &quot; key ally , the United States , strongly desires , as it seeks to draw China into a lasting and peaceful Asian order .
for too long , intemperate historical debates - often driven by biased newspaper accounts - have poisoned bilateral relations .
now , as another war of words heats up , Japanese and South Korean leaders need to step back , recognize where the real interests of their people lie , both today and in the future , and calmly begin to take the measures required to ensure durable reconciliation .
taming the China Bears
Beijing - The market is always in search of a story , and investors , it seems , think they have found a new one this year in China .
the country &apos;s growth slowdown and mounting financial risks have spurred a growing wave of pessimism , with economists worldwide warning of an impending crash .
but dire predictions for China have abounded for the last 30 years , and not one has materialized .
are today &apos;s really so different ?
the short answer is no .
like the predictions of the past , today &apos;s warnings are based on historical precedents and universal indicators against which China , with its unique economic features , simply cannot be judged accurately .
the bottom line is that the complexity and distinctiveness of China &apos;s economy mean that assessing its current state and performance requires a detail @-@ oriented analysis that accounts for as many offsetting factors as possible .
predictions are largely pointless , given that the assumptions underpinning them will invariably change .
consider China &apos;s high leverage ratio , which many argue will be a key factor in causing a crisis .
after all , they contend , developing countries that have experienced a large @-@ scale credit boom have all ended up facing a credit crisis and a hard economic landing .
but several specific factors must be accounted for in assessing whether this is China &apos;s fate .
while China &apos;s debt / GDP ratio is very high , the same is true in many successful East Asian economies , such as Taiwan , Singapore , South Korea , Thailand , and Malaysia .
and China &apos;s saving rate is much higher .
ceteris paribus , the higher the saving rate , the less likely it is that a high debt / GDP ratio will trigger a financial crisis .
in fact , China &apos;s high debt / GDP ratio is , to a large extent , a result of its simultaneously high saving and investment rates .
and , while the inability to repay loans can contribute to a high debt burden , the nonperforming @-@ loan ( NPL ) ratio for China &apos;s major banks stands at less than 1 % .
if , based on these considerations , one concludes that China &apos;s debt / GDP ratio does constitute a substantial threat to its financial stability , there remains the question of whether a crisis is likely to occur .
only when all of the specific linkages between a high debt burden and the onset of a financial crisis have been identified can one draw even a tentative conclusion about that .
China &apos;s real @-@ estate price bubble is often named as a likely catalyst for a crisis .
but how such a downturn would unfold is far from certain .
let us assume that the real @-@ estate bubble has burst .
in China , there are no subprime mortgages , and the down payment on the purchase price required to qualify for financing can exceed 50 % .
given that property prices are unlikely to fall by such a large margin , the bubble &apos;s collapse would not bring down China &apos;s banks .
even if real @-@ estate prices fell by more than 50 % , commercial banks could survive - not least because mortgages account for only about 20 % of banks &quot; total assets .
at the same time , plummeting prices would attract new homebuyers in major cities , causing the market to stabilize .
and China &apos;s recently announced urbanization strategy should ensure that cities &quot; demographic structure supports intrinsic demand .
if that were not enough to ward off disaster , the government could purchase unsold properties and use them for social housing .
moreover , if necessary , banks could recover funds by selling collateral .
as a last resort , the government could step in , as it did in the late 1990 &quot; s and early 2000 &quot; s , to remove NPLs from banks &quot; balance sheets .
indeed , China has a massive war chest of foreign @-@ exchange reserves that it would not hesitate to use to inject capital into commercial banks .
that remains a highly unlikely scenario .
China &apos;s banking system does face risks stemming from a maturity mismatch between loans and deposits .
but the mismatch is less severe than some observers believe .
in fact , the average term of deposits in China &apos;s banks is about nine months , while medium- and long @-@ term loans account for just over half of total outstanding credit .
a more salient threat would arise if the government pursued too much capital @-@ account liberalization too fast .
if China eases restrictions on cross @-@ border capital flows , an unexpected shock could trigger large @-@ scale capital flight , bringing down the entire financial system .
given this , it is vital that China maintains controls over short @-@ term cross @-@ border capital flows in the foreseeable future .
likewise , the Chinese government must address a fundamental contradiction .
monetary interest rates have increased steadily , owing to rampant regulatory arbitrage ( whereby banks find loopholes that enable them to avoid unfavorable rules ) and the fragmentation of the credit market , while return on capital has fallen rapidly because of overcapacity .
if the Chinese government fails to reverse this trend , a financial crisis - in one form or another - will become inevitable .
but , given the authorities &quot; broad scope for policy intervention , the crash will not come anytime soon - if it comes at all .
the Long March from the Third Plenum
Beijing - Though China &apos;s leadership succession was completed earlier this year , the policy agenda for the coming decade has only just been revealed .
following Chinese political tradition , the country &apos;s new leadership had to wait for the Third Plenum of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s 18th Central Committee - held 3 @-@ 4 quarters after the First Plenum , where the succession was sealed - to unveil its economic @-@ policy priorities .
third Plenums - and perhaps only Third Plenums - can bring about radical transformation .
indeed , it was at the Third Plenum of the CCP &apos;s 11th Central Committee that Deng Xiaoping launched the reforms that opened up the Chinese economy and triggered more than three decades of rapid economic growth .
the Third Plenums of the CCP &apos;s 14th and 16th Central Committees - held in 1993 and 2003 , respectively - also stand out .
at both meetings , CCP leaders put forward comprehensive plans for the creation and perfection of the so @-@ called &quot; socialist market economy &quot; in China .
the 60 @-@ point &quot; resolution &quot; produced at the most recent Third Plenum covers six areas : the economy , the political system , the environment , culture , society , and Party capacity @-@ building .
this represents a significant departure from the agendas produced at previous Third Plenums , which focused exclusively on economic reform .
but , when it comes to economic @-@ reform objectives , the resolution is not overwhelmingly innovative .
indeed , most of the goals that it includes - like reform of state @-@ owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , development of private enterprise , reduction of government intervention , protection of property rights , and creation of a modern market system - can be found in the resolution of the Third Plenum of the CCP &apos;s 16th Central Committee .
even the decision to redefine the market &apos;s role in resource allocation as &quot; decisive &quot; was not the breakthrough that many observers have claimed .
after all , the 2003 resolution had already defined the market as &quot; fundamental &quot; to resource allocation .
given this , the latest resolution &apos;s most important implication is that it has dispelled any doubt about the new leadership &apos;s commitment to the market @-@ oriented reform that Deng initiated in 1978 .
in line with tradition , the Third Plenum &apos;s resolution did not discuss problems concerning growth and development , which one hopes the government will address in greater detail in the near future .
that said , some of the resolution &apos;s specific provisions for economic reform represent much @-@ needed progress .
· SOEs will be required to deliver 30 % of their profits to the state , instead of keeping most - or even all - of their profits , as they have done for the last two decades .
· Farmers will be granted more property rights , allowing them , for example , to transfer and mortgage land @-@ use rights , though the government understandably continues to exercise caution about rural @-@ land privatization .
· A real @-@ estate property tax will be introduced , in order to suppress skyrocketing housing prices and reduce the vacancy rate - a controversial but perhaps necessary move .
· The one @-@ child policy will be eased , allowing a couple to have two children if one parent is an only child .
( whether this change will be enough to reverse problematic demographic trends remains a topic of heated debate . )
· The government will &quot; accelerate the reform of the household registration system , &quot; in an effort to facilitate urbanization .
but emphasis seems to have shifted to encourage coordinated development between urban and rural areas .
while rural migrant workers will be encouraged to settle in small and medium @-@ size cities , migration to metropolises will remain tightly controlled - or even be more strictly regulated .
but the resolution &apos;s genuinely groundbreaking objectives lie in other areas .
for starters , the resolution includes two potentially game @-@ changing legal reforms .
first , it emphasizes the government &apos;s commitment to &quot; respect and protect human rights , &quot; prohibiting law @-@ enforcement authorities from extracting confessions &quot; by torture , corporal punishment , or abuse &quot; and abolishing widely criticized programs for &quot; re @-@ education through the labor system . &quot;
second , in order to strengthen judicial independence , the resolution includes a call &quot; to explore the establishment of judicial jurisdiction systems that are suitably separated from administrative areas . &quot;
in other words , the courts should be able to make decisions independently of the local governments that finance them .
in the political realm , the resolution includes measures to strengthen China &apos;s so @-@ called &quot; consultative democracy . &quot;
while the concept of enhancing the role of non @-@ CCP forces in Chinese politics is not new , its prominence in the resolution reflects the Party &apos;s willingness to adopt a more democratic political system - as long as it retains its dominant position , of course .
in a one @-@ party system , meritocracy is a prerequisite for good governance , which in turn plays a central role in maintaining social stability .
unfortunately , meritocracy has been eroded by a political culture of sycophancy and cynicism .
designing a screening mechanism to minimize adverse selection in choosing bureaucrats and party officials has become one of the biggest challenges that China &apos;s ruling elites confront .
although the resolution &apos;s general message is encouraging , a shopping list of reform objectives is not a strategic analysis of the contradictions that are undermining China &apos;s development , let alone an action plan for responding to these contradictions .
indeed , for China &apos;s new leadership , the successful completion of the Third Plenum is only the first step in a new long march toward a more stable , prosperous future .
China &apos;s Trilemma
Beijing - The Nobel laureate economist Robert Mundell showed that an economy can maintain two - but only two - of three key features : monetary @-@ policy independence , a fixed exchange rate , and free cross @-@ border capital flows .
but China is currently juggling all three - an act that is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain .
at first glance , this may not seem to be the case .
given that the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) has largely maintained its monetary @-@ policy independence over the last three decades , and actively manages the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate , it is natural to conclude that China imposes strict controls on capital flows .
in fact , China liberalized inward foreign direct investment more than 20 years ago , and eased controls for much of the capital account thereafter .
China &apos;s efforts to regulate cross @-@ border capital flows have never been very effective .
during the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s , China had to implement draconian measures to prevent capital flight .
in the early 2000s , short @-@ term capital began to flow into China , with investors betting on the renminbi &apos;s appreciation and , from 2004 @-@ 2006 , on rising asset prices .
since renminbi internationalization was launched in 2009 , exchange @-@ rate arbitrage and the carry trade have surged .
certainly , China &apos;s capital controls , though porous , increase the transaction costs of moving short @-@ term capital to and from China , thereby reducing upward pressure on the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate ; in extreme circumstances , this could play a decisive role in China &apos;s financial security .
but capital continues to flow - if not entirely freely - across China &apos;s borders .
this raises an obvious question : how has China managed to defy the Mundell trilemma by maintaining all three policy objectives simultaneously ?
the answer lies in China &apos;s sterilization policy .
China has run a capital @-@ account surplus for most of the last 30 years , and a trade surplus every year since 1993 .
the PBOC keeps the exchange rate stable by intervening heavily in the foreign @-@ exchange market , creating so much liquidity that the authorities must engage in massive sterilization to avoid overshooting the targeted increase in the monetary base .
in China , unlike in advanced countries , monetary and sterilization policy are often one in the same .
the degree to which monetary policy is expansionary depends on the degree to which the liquidity created by currency @-@ market intervention has been sterilized .
the most frequently used monetary instrument in sterilization is open @-@ market operations .
given China &apos;s twin surpluses , the PBOC sold all of the government bonds that it had accumulated in 2003 , so it has been selling central @-@ bank bills ever since , with CN ¥ 5 trillion ( $ 812 billion ) in such bills currently held by banks .
another important instrument for sterilization is the reserve @-@ requirement ratio , which , when raised , locks a large amount of liquidity in the banking system .
the ratio , which the PBOC has changed 42 times since 1998 , currently stands at 20 % - double the ratio for large banks in the United States .
whatever the mechanism , the costs of sterilization are very high .
for starters , by maintaining an undervalued real exchange rate , China has fallen into the so @-@ called &quot; dollar trap , &quot; boosting the US dollar &apos;s international importance at China &apos;s own expense .
as time passes , the senselessness of this policy will become increasingly apparent .
sterilization also leads to a serious misallocation of resources , most obviously by functioning as a subsidy to the export sector , at the expense of the rest of the economy .
a less noticed form of resource misallocation stems from the fact that only sellers of foreign exchange gain liquidity , but the whole economy feels the effects .
as a result , small and medium @-@ size enterprises that produce non @-@ tradable products are denied much @-@ needed funds and suffer from sterilization &apos;s negative externalities .
furthermore , the high reserve ratio and forced purchase of central @-@ bank bills squeezes commercial banks &quot; profits severely - a phenomenon that will be intensified by interest @-@ rate liberalization .
the quest for yield on available funds will drive banks to make riskier investments .
there are also quasi @-@ fiscal costs involved .
fortunately , despite the low returns on foreign assets , this is not yet a major problem for China , owing to the low costs of the corresponding PBOC liabilities .
nonetheless , though predictions that China would abandon its exchange @-@ rate controls in order to uphold monetary autonomy have proved wrong over the last decade , this time may be different .
with China &apos;s liberalization of interest rates and short @-@ term capital flows making it increasingly difficult for the country to juggle Mundell &apos;s &quot; irreconcilable trinity , &quot; one hopes that Chinese leaders will finally allow the renminbi to float , while keeping in place existing capital controls .
reviving China &apos;s Rebalancing
Beijing - China is at a crossroads .
after experiencing three decades of unprecedentedly rapid GDP growth , the country weathered the global economic crisis exceptionally well .
but it sustains considerable economic imbalances , which are undermining its ability to achieve high @-@ income status .
the question is whether China &apos;s leaders - preoccupied with challenges like financial instability stemming from risky shadow @-@ banking activities and a heavy burden of local @-@ government debt - have the policy space to put the economy on a sounder footing .
in the aftermath of the global economic crisis , China appeared to be on track to complete such a rebalancing .
its current @-@ account surplus fell from more than 10 % of GDP in 2007 to 2.6 % in 2012 , and it ran a large capital @-@ account deficit for the first time since 1998 .
moreover , China added only $ 98.7 billion to its foreign @-@ exchange reserves in 2012 , compared to an average annual increase of more than $ 435 billion from 2007 to 2011 .
that meant diminishing upward pressure on the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate .
but , over the last year , China &apos;s imbalances returned with a vengeance .
its 2013 trade surplus likely exceeded $ 250 billion ; its capital @-@ account surplus exceeded $ 200 billion in the first three quarters of the year ; and its foreign @-@ exchange reserves soared by $ 509.7 billion .
meanwhile , the lower current @-@ account surplus ( as a share of GDP ) could be a result of its increased investment @-@ income deficit .
and , while recovery in the advanced economies boosted exports , persistent overcapacity , combined with slower household @-@ consumption growth than in 2012 , caused investment growth , though still rapid , to decline to its lowest rate in the past 11 years .
in principle , a country can run a current @-@ account deficit or surplus continuously for decades .
but China &apos;s chronic surpluses are problematic .
given that China remains among the world &apos;s poorest countries , with per capita income amounting to less than $ 7,000 , its position as the world &apos;s largest exporter of capital signifies a gross misallocation of resources .
in fact , after running twin current- and capital @-@ account surpluses persistently for two decades , China &apos;s foreign @-@ exchange reserves are poised to break the $ 4 trillion threshold , with the marginal cost of every dollar accrued vastly surpassing its potential benefits .
in this context , the continued accumulation of foreign @-@ exchange reserves is clearly counterproductive .
of course , rebalancing China &apos;s economy will take time , and it will entail some risks and sacrifices .
but China &apos;s leaders must recognize that the country faces massive welfare losses , and thus should be willing to accept slower growth in the short term in exchange for a more stable long @-@ term growth path .
in fact , with a well @-@ designed policy package , the duration and impact of the growth slowdown could be minimized .
a critical first step is for the People &apos;s Bank of China to stop intervening in the foreign @-@ exchange market , which would halt the growth of the country &apos;s foreign @-@ exchange reserves .
in other words , China should adopt a floating exchange @-@ rate regime as soon as possible .
although this transition would have a negative impact on China &apos;s economic growth , it would not be nearly as dire as many seem to believe .
for starters , while it would likely cause the renminbi to strengthen , the consensus in China is that the current exchange rate is not far from the equilibrium level , meaning that the appreciation would likely be moderate .
likewise , although renminbi appreciation would diminish export growth , the slowdown would probably not be dramatic , given that China &apos;s export sector is dominated by the processing trade ( specifically , the assembly of intermediate inputs imported from countries like Japan and South Korea ) .
and the accompanying increase in imports is unlikely to damage China &apos;s economic growth significantly ; it is more likely to complement , rather than substitute for , domestic demand .
in short , China can afford the costs of rebalancing .
given that the liquidity flowing into China over the last several years was increasingly short @-@ term capital aimed at exchange @-@ rate and interest @-@ rate arbitrage ( so @-@ called &quot; hot money &quot; ) , there may be a surge in capital outflows when appreciation expectations have disappeared .
to prevent large @-@ scale capital flight from threatening China &apos;s financial stability , cross @-@ border flows must be managed carefully .
a flexible exchange rate dictated by market forces would eliminate the opportunities for currency speculators to make one @-@ way bets on renminbi appreciation , thereby diminishing the stock of hot money that currently accounts for the bulk of China &apos;s capital @-@ account surplus .
even if China &apos;s current account remained in surplus for some time , the shift from twin surpluses to a more normal external position would boost the efficiency of resource allocation considerably .
for too long , China has delayed the necessary adjustment of its balance @-@ of @-@ payments structure .
it is time to make a change , even if it requires bracing for some risks .
China &apos;s Investment Addiction
Beijing - China &apos;s economy slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter of this year .
just as unexpectedly , most data released since July suggest that China &apos;s growth has stabilized .
markets , not surprisingly , have breathed a collective sigh of relief .
but should investors still be nervous ?
currently , the most severe problem confronting Chinese authorities is overcapacity .
for example , China &apos;s annual production capacity for crude steel is one billion tons , but its total output in 2012 was 720 million tons - a capacity utilization rate of 72 % .
more strikingly , the steel industry &apos;s profitability was just 0.04 % in 2012 .
indeed , the profit on two tons of steel was just about enough to buy a lollipop .
so far this year , the average profitability of China &apos;s top 500 companies is 4.34 % , down 33 basis points from 2012 .
some say that today &apos;s overcapacity is a result of China &apos;s past overinvestment .
others attribute it to a lack of effective demand .
the government seems to come down in the middle .
on one hand , the authorities have ordered thousands of companies to reduce capacity .
on the other hand , the government has introduced some &quot; mini @-@ stimulus &quot; measures , ranging from exemptions for &quot; micro firms &quot; from business and sales taxes to pressure on banks to increase loans to exporters .
the authorities &quot; official line is that China &apos;s growth model requires less investment and more consumption .
but not all Chinese economists agree .
they argue that capital stock is the key factor for growth , and that China &apos;s per capita capital stock is still low relative to developed countries , which implies considerable scope for further investment .
to be sure , capital accumulation is a driving force of economic growth , and catching up with developed @-@ country income levels implies that China must increase its capital stock in the long run .
but what is at issue is not the size of the capital stock , or even the level of investment ; the problem is the growth rate of investment , which has been significantly higher than that of GDP for decades .
according to official statistics , China &apos;s investment rate is approaching 50 % of GDP .
given absorption constraints , capital efficiency has been falling steadily amid increasing deadweight .
if environmental damage caused by breakneck investment growth were taken into account , China &apos;s capital efficiency would be even lower .
human capital and technological progress are as important to economic growth as physical capital and labor , if not more so .
if resource allocation is skewed toward physical capital at the expense of accumulating human capital - for which adequate consumption is indispensable - economic growth would be more likely to slow than rise .
so China should reduce the growth rate of investment and increase that of consumption , allowing the investment rate to settle at a more sustainable level .
of course , it is not entirely untrue that China &apos;s overcapacity reflects a shortfall of effective demand .
but where can effective demand come from ?
again , China &apos;s steel industry provides a telling example .
despite China &apos;s lack of a comparative advantage for steel production , it has built approximately one thousand mills , with output accounting for roughly half of the global total .
as early as 2004 , China &apos;s government tried to clamp down on overinvestment ; and yet output increased dramatically , from 300 million tons that year to a billion tons in 2012 , owing to strong demand generated by investment in infrastructure and real @-@ estate development .
China &apos;s investment consists of mainly three broad categories : manufacturing industry , infrastructure , and real estate .
in late 2008 and 2009 , at the height of the global financial crisis , stimulus @-@ fueled infrastructure investment sustained output growth .
in 2010 , investment in real @-@ estate development replaced infrastructure investment as the main driver of growth .
today , both infrastructure and real estate are important drivers of China &apos;s growth .
China does need more infrastructure investment - particularly in power and water utilities , transport , and communications .
but the pace of investment must take financial constraints fully into consideration .
more important , China can and should invest more in social infrastructure such as schools , hospitals , retirement homes , and so on .
however , real @-@ estate investment is another story .
it is difficult to judge how serious China &apos;s property bubble is and when it might burst .
but one thing is certain : China has invested too much in real @-@ estate development .
with per capita income at less than $ 6,000 , homeownership in China is roughly 90 % , compared to less than 70 % in the United States .
average floor space per capita is 32.9 square meters , while median floor space per family in Hong Kong is just 48 square meters .
China has 696 five @-@ star hotels , with another 500 on the way .
five of the ten tallest skyscrapers under construction worldwide are in China .
in my view , this is madness .
China &apos;s economy is being held hostage by real @-@ estate investment .
on one hand , China should not try to eliminate overcapacity by maintaining the high growth rate of real @-@ estate investment .
while investment in social housing should be welcomed , real @-@ estate investment , currently running at 10 @-@ 13 % of GDP , is already far too high .
on the other hand , if real @-@ estate investment growth falls , overcapacity will be difficult to eliminate .
this dilemma highlights the structural @-@ adjustment challenge that China faces - and should give investors reason to hold their breath .
that said , there are two caveats .
first , unlike other categories of investment , real estate investment does not increase productive capital stock .
there is no fundamental difference between a house and an expensive durable consumer good .
second , in China &apos;s statistics , the growth rate of gross fixed @-@ asset investment is much higher than that of gross capital formation .
this indicates that data on the growth rate of fixed @-@ asset investment may have exaggerated the pace of capital @-@ stock accumulation .
hence , while the Chinese government should be firm on reducing the dependence of growth on investment , it must exercise utmost care when doing so .
China &apos;s Fire Next Time
Beijing - Earlier this year , rumors of China &apos;s impending financial doom - triggered by either a housing @-@ market crash or local @-@ government debt defaults - were rampant .
but , in recent months , the economy has stabilized , leaving few doubts about China &apos;s ability to grow by more than 7 % this year .
given that the Chinese government had ample scope for policy intervention , this turnaround should come as no surprise .
but the moment of financial reckoning has merely been postponed , not averted .
the fundamental problems that triggered alarm bells in the first place - including real @-@ estate bubbles , local @-@ government debt , rapid growth in shadow @-@ banking activity , and rising corporate leverage ratios - remain unresolved .
of these , the most immediate threat to China &apos;s economic and financial stability is the combination of high borrowing costs , low profitability for nonfinancial corporations , and very high corporate leverage ratios .
according to a study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , the debt / GDP ratio for China &apos;s nonfinancial corporations was 113 % by the end of 2012 .
standard &amp; Poor &apos;s found that , a year later , these firms &quot; total debt amounted to $ 14.2 trillion , eclipsing the $ 13.1 trillion of outstanding debt in the United States and making China the world &apos;s largest issuer of corporate debt .
there is no indication that the ratio will decline anytime soon , which is particularly worrisome , given the low profitability and high borrowing costs that China &apos;s industrial enterprises face .
indeed , Chinese firms &quot; profitability amounted to just over 6 % last year , with 2012 profits for China &apos;s 500 largest ( mostly state @-@ owned ) corporations barely exceeding 2 % .
meanwhile , interest rates on bank loans to nonfinancial enterprises remain close to 7 % , despite having fallen slightly over the last year .
and , in the second quarter of this year , the annualized interest rate on loans to small nonfinancial corporations surpassed 25 % .
with insufficient profits to use for investment , nonfinancial corporations will become increasingly dependent on external finance .
as their leverage ratios increase , so will their risk premiums , causing their borrowing costs to rise and undermining their profitability further .
this destructive cycle will be difficult to break .
for example , if companies reduce investment , they will weaken growth and boost their leverage ratio further .
to be sure , China overcame a similar challenge in its public sector from 1998 to 2001 .
it pursued growth @-@ boosting investment in infrastructure and real @-@ estate development to eliminate deflation , while maintaining artificially low interest rates to contain the rise of public debt .
but a lot has changed since then .
in fact , the investment @-@ led growth model that facilitated double @-@ digit growth in the decade after 2001 has exacerbated structural weaknesses , which must now be addressed .
indeed , China must stem the pace of real @-@ estate investment , which accounted for more than 13 % of GDP in recent years - a move that will undoubtedly lead to slower economic growth and , in turn , reduce the profitability of China &apos;s nonfinancial corporates further .
moreover , ongoing interest @-@ rate liberalization - which has occurred both openly and surreptitiously - means that artificially low borrowing costs have become far more difficult to maintain .
though the People &apos;s Bank of China still officially caps interest rates on deposits , commercial banks - in cooperation with nonbank financial institutions , especially trust companies - are using wealth @-@ management products to attract deposits with de facto free @-@ market interest rates .
as a result , the PBOC is losing control over interest rates on corporate loans , and thus has few options for constraining leverage ratios .
despite these risks , it is too early to bet on a corporate @-@ debt crisis in China .
for starters , no one knows at what corporate leverage ratio a crisis will be triggered .
in 1996 , when Japan &apos;s public debt / GDP ratio reached 80 % , many Japanese economists and officials worried about a looming crisis .
almost two decades later , the ratio has surpassed 200 % - and still no crisis has erupted .
furthermore , China has not yet completed its market @-@ orientated reforms , which could unleash major growth potential in many areas .
given the role that institutional factors play in China &apos;s corporate @-@ debt problem , such reforms could go a long way toward resolving it .
China &apos;s leaders should take advantage of this respite from instability and low confidence to redouble their reform efforts .
otherwise , they can expect alarm bells to begin ringing again - and , next time , they may not have the tools they need to silence them .
the Enigma of European Defense
Paris - While Europe &apos;s citizens largely support the establishment of a common security and defense policy , most European leaders have demonstrated a clear lack of interest in creating one - including at last month &apos;s European Council meeting .
what accounts for this paradox ?
one possible explanation is that financially strained European governments lack the means to fulfill their citizens &quot; expectations .
but that is unconvincing , given that the issue was framed in almost identical terms three decades ago , when budgetary constraints were not a problem .
in fact , it could be argued that such constraints should spur , not impede , the creation of a European defense structure .
after all , member countries would then be able to pool their resources , harmonize programs , and rationalize costs , thereby reducing individual governments &quot; financial burden .
another , far more credible explanation is that Europeans &quot; interpretations of &quot; a more active and stronger security policy &quot; differ widely .
indeed , current discussions in Europe concerning the use of force are dominated by three main perspectives , championed by France , the United Kingdom , and Germany .
France , which has once again intervened in Africa - this time to restore order in the Central African Republic - is the only European Union country that seems genuinely interested in satisfying popular demand for more robust European security structures .
the French consider Europe to be a kind of superpower - a status that implies a corresponding military capacity .
while this view probably stems from France &apos;s historical political and military prowess , it also reflects the country &apos;s current interests .
as Europe &apos;s greatest military power ( despite the UK &apos;s larger defense budget ) , France would play a key role in any wide @-@ ranging European military operation .
the UK , for its part , shares France &apos;s belief that military power is a prerequisite to strategic effectiveness .
it claims that its opposition to a European defense structure stems from its belief that NATO - and thus the United States - is critical to European defense .
but , given that no other EU country has seriously considered excluding NATO , this argument seems to be little more than an excuse .
the truth is that the only kind of defense the British accept is that conducted by a coalition of European states acting under their national flags , as occurred in Libya .
in the UK &apos;s view , &quot; European &quot; operations should be limited to humanitarian and peacekeeping objectives .
while it supported the fight against piracy off the Horn of Africa , that was more a policing operation than a military one , and it was guided by a shared interest in protecting trade routes from the Middle East and Asia .
Germany &apos;s vision of European defense is very different from the French and British perspectives .
unlike the UK , Germany supports a European security and defense policy , proudly highlighting its consistent military budget and major presence in European missions ( larger than that of the overstretched French ) .
and , though Germany shares the UK &apos;s belief that NATO bears primary responsibility for protecting Europe , its view of European engagement is even more restrictive .
in Germany &apos;s view , European military intervention should be limited to the continent , and should not include combat operations .
in fact , a majority of Europe &apos;s citizens prefer that European forces be deployed only for non @-@ combat missions .
and , so far , virtually all European military operations have been aimed at evacuating European nationals , delivering humanitarian aid , or maintaining peace in the aftermath of conflict .
these differing views explain the uncertainty surrounding France &apos;s recent interventions in Africa .
the French have lamented the miniscule support offered by the rest of Europe for its operations in Mali and the Central African Republic - exemplified by Germany &apos;s refusal to create a fund for EU member @-@ state operations .
but , given the urgency of the situations in Libya , Mali , and the Central African Republic , this lack of support has not undermined France &apos;s efforts as much as prior consultation with European leaders would have done .
had the Germans been consulted , they probably would have rejected the interventions anyway .
this conflict between the need for rapid response and the requirement for deliberation explains why the EU &apos;s much @-@ discussed &quot; Battlegroups &quot; are unlikely ever to be deployed .
the fact that most Europeans are satisfied with limited political and military involvement outside of Europe makes increased defense cooperation even less likely .
a pessimist would say that Europeans are unable - or at least unwilling - to rethink their defense policy , because the US ultimately ensures their security through NATO .
according to this view , France &apos;s efforts to encourage both transatlantic integration and autonomous political action are insufficient to change most Europeans &quot; minds .
a more optimistic interpretation is that Europe needs defense structures that account for the role of member states - not just for that of the EU .
from this perspective , Europe does have a significant military presence , whether in Afghanistan and Libya or Mali and the Central African Republic .
that is a start .
the GDP @-@ Wellbeing Gap
Kuala LUMPUR - The link between economic growth and human wellbeing seems obvious .
indeed , as measured by gross domestic product , economic growth is widely viewed as the ultimate development objective .
but it is time to rethink this approach .
in fact , there is a rising disconnect between countries &quot; per capita GDP and their citizens &quot; wellbeing , as rapid output growth exacerbates health challenges and erodes environmental conditions .
given this , people increasingly value non @-@ material wealth just as highly as monetary wealth , if not more .
but persuading policymakers and politicians of GDP &apos;s limitations is no easy feat .
after all , it is far simpler to defend a well @-@ understood , long @-@ accepted framework than it is to champion a new worldview .
to be sure , GDP provides valuable information about a country &apos;s production , expenditure , and income streams , as well as the flow of goods across borders .
moreover , it has provided crucial guidance to countries , helping them to track economic gains that have improved citizens &quot; quality of life considerably - in many cases lifting them out of destitution .
but GDP fails to account for changes in a country &apos;s stock of assets , making it difficult for policymakers to balance economic , social , and environmental concerns .
without better measures of wellbeing - including health , education , and the state of the natural environment - policymakers cannot gain the insights that they need to ensure the long @-@ term health of the economy and the individuals who comprise it .
this imperative underpins the concept of &quot; sustainable development , &quot; which has gradually gained acceptance since its introduction in the mid @-@ 1980 &quot; s .
but , even as countries have recognized the need for a more comprehensive understanding of development , they have largely retained GDP growth as their central objective .
this has to change .
even US @-@ based Nobel laureate Simon Kuznets , the depression @-@ era father of GDP , said in 1934 that , &quot; the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measure of national income . &quot;
the good news is that a robust , simple , and effective framework for measuring sustainability already exists .
developed by a group of leading economists , including the Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow and Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge , it assesses an economy &apos;s income flows in the context of its stocks of assets , including human and natural capital .
in other words , it accounts for the economy &apos;s productive base , rather than just its monetary wealth .
based on this framework , United Nations University and the UN Environment Program unveiled the Inclusive Wealth Report ( IWR ) at the 2012 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro .
by providing a long @-@ term comparison between GDP and &quot; inclusive wealth &quot; for 20 countries , the report aimed to motivate policymakers to take a more comprehensive , longer @-@ term view of their economies &quot; development .
this November , a second IWR will be released , with many more countries represented and a stronger focus on human capital in national @-@ account indicators .
to this end , collaborating experts will convene in Malaysia this month for a series of meetings , culminating in a public symposium entitled &quot; Beyond Gross Domestic Product - transitioning into Sustainability . &quot;
transforming the world &apos;s understanding of economic development requires a dynamic approach .
experts in various fields - including economics , sociology , psychology , and the natural sciences - must work together to develop an integrated suite of indicators that provides a comprehensive picture of humanity &apos;s productive base , on which people &apos;s ability to pursue their interpretation of success depends .
while final decisions should rest with policymakers and citizens , the process must be guided by the best available science , uncompromised by political demands or vested interests .
moreover , one fundamental truth must be recognized : the planet cannot accommodate high @-@ income status for all seven billion of its inhabitants .
for every country to attain per capita GDP of $ 13,000 ( which , according to the World Bank , delineates high @-@ income status ) , global GDP would need to rise from roughly $ 72 trillion today to $ 91 trillion .
if , however , we already use the equivalent of 1.5 earths to provide the resources we consume and to absorb our waste , the planet can sustainably support a GDP of only $ 48 @-@ 50 trillion .
and if the planet already exceeds its sustainable carrying capacity , we should be reducing our demands on it - not adding new ones .
simply put , we can no longer depend on GDP growth , and the limitless wealth accumulation that it implies , to solve our social and economic problems .
the world must align its value systems with this reality .
we must learn to do more with less , decouple economic growth from resource consumption , and nurture the social and spiritual aspects of our existence .
this shift will be impossible without fundamental changes to our education systems , political structures , and institutions .
it is a tall order , but our future depends on fulfilling it .
a Zero @-@ Carbon Economy Is Within reach
Beijing - When the Paris climate agreement was concluded in December 2015 , almost all the world &apos;s countries committed to limit global warming to well below 2 ° Celsius relative to pre @-@ industrial levels , and have submitted &quot; Intended Nationally Determined Contributions &quot; ( INDCs ) describing how they will either contain or reduce emissions over the next decade .
global investment in renewable power now far exceeds investment in fossil fuel plants ; battery costs are falling , and electric vehicle sales rising ; and even in President Donald Trump &apos;s America , coal @-@ fired power stations continue to close .
but despite this progress , the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) contains a chilling prediction : on current trends , the world is heading toward 3 ° C of global warming by 2100 , to a level not reached for more than a million years .
the harm to human welfare is likely to be catastrophic .
the IPCC report makes it clear that the ideal target should be to limit warming to 1.5 ° C. Above that level , the adverse consequences become ever more extreme .
but to achieve that goal , global carbon dioxide emissions would have to reach net zero by about 2055 , and still earlier if , as is unfortunately inevitable , emissions remain at current levels for several more years .
the precise implications for acceptable emissions from power stations , industrial plants , transport networks , and heating systems depend on how rapidly emissions caused by land @-@ use change such as deforestation can be eliminated , and how rapidly emissions of non @-@ CO2 greenhouse gases ( for example , methane or nitrous oxide ) can be reduced .
but it &apos;s clear that unless we get to net zero emissions from energy use and industry by around 2060 - and earlier in developed economies - we will have to rely on the risky assumption that land @-@ use changes can deliver large negative emissions in the late twenty @-@ first century .
failing that , warming will rise significantly above 1.5 ° C .
getting to net zero emissions in just four decades will be a huge challenge .
but as a forthcoming report from the Energy Transitions Commission argues , the good news is that it is undoubtedly technically possible , and at an acceptably low cost to the global economy .
moreover , we already know the key technologies we need to achieve this objective .
all feasible paths to a low @-@ carbon economy and , eventually , net zero CO2 emissions require a massive increase in the role of electricity .
the share of electricity in final energy demand will have to grow from around 20 % today to around 60 % by mid- to late century , and total global electricity generation will have to rise dramatically , from around 25,000 TWh today to as much as 100,000 TWh .
that electricity must come from low @-@ carbon sources .
and while nuclear power and gas generation offset by carbon capture may play a role , the lion &apos;s share will have to come from renewable sources - 70 @-@ 80 % in the IPCC &apos;s scenarios .
but there is plenty enough land in the world to support renewable expansion on that scale , and enough time to make the necessary investments as long as we act fast .
three other sets of technologies will also be essential .
first , hydrogen , ammonia , and perhaps methanol must be used as energy carriers in transport and industrial applications and as chemical feedstock inputs .
all three will eventually be produced synthetically , using clean electricity as the ultimate energy source .
second , biomass could provide low @-@ carbon aviation fuel , or feedstock for plastics production .
the total scale of use , however , will need to be carefully managed to avoid harmful impacts on ecosystems and food supply .
third , there should be at least some role for carbon capture , and either storage or use , in key industrial processes such as cement production , where viable alternative routes to decarbonization are currently unavailable .
building a zero @-@ carbon economy will of course require massive investment in power production and transmission , new industrial plants , and more efficient equipment .
to achieve the 1.5 ° C objective , the IPCC estimates that the required additional global investment , from 2015 to 2050 , could be $ 900 billion per annum .
that may seem like a startlingly high figure ; but , assuming 3 % annual economic growth , global GDP , which stands at almost $ 100 trillion today , could reach $ 260 trillion by 2050 .
this implies that the world needs to invest less than 0.6 % of its income over the next four decades to avoid potentially catastrophic harm to human welfare .
China alone currently invests more than $ 5 trillion each year , a significant proportion of which is wasted on the construction of apartment blocks which will never be occupied in cities which face static and eventually declining populations .
by redirecting investment , China could build a zero @-@ carbon economy without any sacrifice of consumption .
for the world as a whole , the impact on living standards of achieving net zero emissions will be trivial .
but while a zero @-@ carbon economy is undoubtedly technically feasible and easily affordable , it will not be achieved without strong public policies and forward @-@ looking business strategies .
governments must deliver carbon pricing and product regulation and support key technologies and infrastructures , and companies in the energy @-@ producing and main energy @-@ using sectors must develop strategies focused on how to achieve zero emissions by mid @-@ century and how to begin the transition today .
the alternative is another decade of only incremental progress , which will put us on a catastrophic path toward 3 ° C warming within the lifetime of today &apos;s children .
the Zero @-@ Sum Economy
London - Across the global economy , the potential for automation seems huge .
Adidas &quot; &quot; Speedfactory &quot; in Bavaria will employ 160 workers to produce 500,000 pairs of shoes each year , a productivity rate over five times higher than in typical factories today .
the British Retail Consortium estimates that retail jobs could fall from three million to 2.1 million within ten years , with only a small fraction replaced by new jobs in online retailing .
many financial @-@ services companies see the potential to cut information @-@ processing jobs to a small fraction of current levels .
and yet , despite all this , measured productivity growth across the developed economies has slowed .
one possible explanation , recently considered by Andrew Haldane , chief economist of the Bank of England , is that while some companies rapidly grasp the new opportunities , others do so only slowly , producing a wide productivity dispersion even within the same sector .
but dispersion alone cannot explain slowing productivity growth : that would require an increase in the degree of dispersion .
however , to focus on how technology is applied to existing jobs may be to look in the wrong place , for the clue to the productivity paradox may instead be found in the activities to which displaced workers move .
David Graeber of the London School of Economics argues that as much as 30 % of all work is performed in &quot; bullshit jobs , &quot; which are unnecessary to produce truly valuable goods and services but arise from competition for income and status .
Graeber usefully views the world from the perspective of an anthropologist , not an economist .
but the phrase &quot; bullshit jobs &quot; and his focus on demotivated workers doing pointless work may divert attention from the essential development : individual workers may regard as stimulating and valuable many jobs which cannot in aggregate contribute to total welfare .
suppose , for example , that you cared passionately about the objectives of a particular charity , had a flair for fundraising , and successfully increased that charity &apos;s share of available donations .
you would probably feel both motivated and good , even if all you had done was divert money from another charity about which another equally motivated fundraiser was equally passionate .
the crucial economic question , therefore , is not whether individual jobs are &quot; bullshit , &quot; but whether they increasingly perform a zero @-@ sum distributive function , whereby the dedication of ever more skill , effort , and technology cannot increase human welfare , given the skill , effort , and technology applied on the other side of the competitive game .
numerous jobs fall into that category : cyber criminals and the cyber experts employed by companies to repel their attacks ; lawyers ( both personal and corporate ) ; much of financial trading and asset management ; tax accountants and revenue officials ; advertising and marketing to build brand X at the expense of brand Y ; rival policy campaigners and think tanks ; even teachers seeking to ensure that their students achieve the higher relative grades that underpin future success .
measuring what share of all economic activity is zero sum is inherently difficult .
many jobs involve both truly creative and merely distributive activities .
and zero @-@ sum activities can be found in all sectors ; manufacturing companies can employ tax accountants to minimize liabilities and top executives who focus on financial engineering .
but available figures suggest that zero @-@ sum activities have grown significantly .
as Gary Hamel and Michele Zanini point out in a recent Harvard Business Review article , some 17.6 % of all US jobs , receiving 30 % of all compensation , are in &quot; management and administrative &quot; functions likely to involve significant zero @-@ sum activity .
meanwhile employment in financial and &quot; business services &quot; firms has grown from 15 % to 18 % of all US jobs in the last 20 years , and from 20 % to 24 % of measured output .
Hamel and Zanini argue that if we could only strip out unnecessary management jobs , productivity could soar .
but the growth of zero @-@ sum activities may be more inherent than they believe .
as technological progress makes us ever richer in terms of many basic goods and services - whether cars or household appliances , restaurant meals or mobile phone calls - it may be inevitable that more human activity is devoted to zero @-@ sum competition for available income and assets .
as our ability to produce higher @-@ quality goods with fewer people increases , value may come to lie more and more in subjective brands , and rational firms will devote resources to activities like market analysis , financial engineering , and tax planning .
eventually , almost all human work might be devoted to zero @-@ sum activities .
whether or not robots will ever achieve human @-@ level intelligence , it is illuminating to consider what an economy would look like if we could automate almost all the work required to produce the goods and services human welfare requires .
there are two possibilities : one is a dramatic increase in leisure ; the other is that ever more work would be devoted to zero @-@ sum competition .
given what we know about human nature , the second development seems likely to play a significant role .
as I argued in a recent lecture , such an economy would probably be a very unequal one , with a small number of IT experts , fashion designers , brand creators , lawyers , and financial traders earning enormous incomes .
paradoxically , the most physical thing of all - locationally desirable land - would dominate asset values , and rules on inheritance would be a key determinant of relative wealth .
in John Maynard Keynes &apos;s words , we would have solved &quot; the economic problem &quot; of how to produce as many goods and services as we want , but would face the more difficult and essentially political questions of how to achieve meaning in a world where work is no longer needed , and how to govern fairly the inherent human tendency toward status competition .
seeking to resolve these challenges through accelerated technological development and faster productivity growth would be like pursuing a mirage .
Zika and Reproductive Rights
new YORK - Mosquitoes know no boundaries , and neither does fear .
as public @-@ health experts grapple with the Zika virus , panic continues to spread around the world .
yet the crisis has brought to light two important truths .
the first revelation is how badly degraded public health systems have become , across Latin America and beyond .
this did not happen by chance .
in large part , it is the result of pressure on developing countries by concessionary lenders , such as the International Monetary Fund , to cut social sector expenses , including health spending , beginning in 1980 .
in Brazil and elsewhere , state authorities could have deployed well @-@ known and cost @-@ effective measures to control mosquito @-@ borne diseases , but they did not .
their most affected citizens , who tend to be poor , have been forced to live with the consequences .
second , the Zika epidemic has revealed , with particular poignancy , another dire threat to public health : the denial of women &apos;s reproductive rights .
governments are shirking their responsibility in this regard too , often in a grotesque manner .
the reported spike in cases of microcephaly - a birth defect - among infants in Zika @-@ affected areas led the governments of Brazil , Colombia , Ecuador , and El Salvador to warn their female citizens &quot; not to become pregnant . &quot;
this message , which places the blame and burden of the Zika epidemic on women , is as unjust as it is unreasonable .
it is also toothless , as many women in the region do not have access to contraception or safe abortions .
the Zika crisis has highlighted an obvious reality : not providing women with reproductive health information and services places their lives - and those of their children - at grave risk .
Latin America &apos;s abortion laws are among the world &apos;s most restrictive .
el Salvador , for example , bans abortion in all circumstances and has incarcerated women who have gone to emergency rooms after miscarriages , charging them with seeking illegal abortions .
contraception can also be expensive or difficult to access across the region , despite high rates of teenage rape and pregnancy .
the result , especially with the addition of the Zika virus , is a recipe for tragedy .
Brazil , the Latin American country hit hardest by the virus so far , is emblematic of the problem : abortion is allowed only in cases of rape , danger to the woman &apos;s life , or in the case of fetal anencephaly ( the absence of a major portion of the brain ) .
in response to the Zika crisis , Brazil should immediately allow abortion in cases of suspected microcephaly as well .
the loosening of restrictions , however , should not stop there .
over the last few years , conservatives in the Brazilian Congress have been trying to place limits on abortion in cases of rape .
these efforts - which demonstrate complete disregard for the rights and dignity of women - must end .
instead , women &apos;s right to seek an abortion should be expanded - and quickly .
governments must also ensure that services are accessible and affordable .
wealthy Brazilian women can afford to pay private health providers for safe abortions .
poor women are forced to resort to poorly trained and equipped providers who operate in unsanitary conditions , sometimes as part of criminal networks .
in September 2014 , two women died in Rio de Janeiro following clandestine abortions .
in the region overall , 95 % of abortions are unsafe .
in Latin America and the Caribbean , 62 % of women aged 15 @-@ 49 want to avoid a pregnancy .
but nearly a quarter of these women are not using an effective method of birth control .
expense is only one barrier for poor women and girls ; another is the lack of information .
men and women need comprehensive sexuality education , so they are informed about their reproductive health and family planning options and know where they can get modern contraceptives .
recent evidence suggesting that Zika might be transmitted sexually adds extra urgency to making male and female condoms and other contraceptives widely available .
the movement for reproductive rights has a long history in Brazil and in other parts of Latin America .
over the last several months - even before Zika - feminists had been taking to the streets in outrage at the lack of access to safe and legal abortions .
the Zika crisis may mark a turning point in the fight for women &apos;s health and equality .
it is certainly a wake @-@ up call for governments everywhere to rebuild and strengthen public health systems , and to guarantee all women and girls access to contraceptives and safe abortions .
women and girls around the world know the alternative - and it is terrifying .
the injustices of Zika
SOUTHAMPTON - outbreaks of communicable diseases in the developing world are bad enough from a health perspective .
but they also have serious implications for social justice , because they exacerbate longstanding human @-@ rights crises , including by undermining already @-@ weak public @-@ services provision and deepening existing inequalities .
like the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa , the Zika outbreak in Central and South America in 2015 hit vulnerable social groups - women and children , ethnic minorities , and the poor - the hardest .
like yellow fever , dengue , and other diseases , Zika is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes .
but , unusually for a mosquito @-@ borne virus , Zika can also be transmitted sexually .
even more unusual , it is associated with neurological and developmental conditions affecting babies : microcephaly and Guillain @-@ Barré syndrome .
otherwise , its symptoms are often rather mild .
this means that , of the more than 1.5 million people stricken by Zika since the outbreak , the consequences were most worrying for women of child @-@ bearing age , especially those who were already pregnant .
between 2016 and 2017 , a total of 11,059 Zika cases in pregnant women were confirmed , producing 10,867 cases of microcephaly and other congenital malformations of their babies &quot; central nervous systems .
fifty @-@ six percent of those babies were born to poor women and women of color from northeast Brazil .
clearly , the Zika crisis is not gender @-@ neutral .
in addressing its medium- to long @-@ term consequences , a focus on women - especially poor women - is needed .
that does not mean more media coverage of the deformities associated with microcephaly or even of the difficulties faced by their mothers .
and it certainly does not mean more efforts to police women &apos;s behavior .
to avoid infection , women have been advised to use mosquito repellent ; remove standing water around their homes ; wear long sleeves ; and , if possible , use condoms or avoid sex .
the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention advised pregnant women to refrain from traveling to affected countries .
most extreme , health officials in El Salvador and Colombia urged women not to get pregnant until 2018 .
such recommendations , however well intended they may be , are fundamentally flawed .
for starters , they emphasize short @-@ term @-@ vector control and surveillance , while delinking the disease from the social and structural determinants of health , including public infrastructure such as running water , proper sanitation , and access to care .
they also place the responsibility for avoiding disease and pregnancy primarily on women , while failing to recognize the lack of control many women have over their bodies and pregnancies .
many of the areas affected by Zika have high rates of sexual violence and teen pregnancy , a lack of sex education , and inadequate access to contraceptives .
for these reasons , more than 50 % of pregnancies in Latin America are unintended .
making matters worse , in most Latin American countries affected by Zika , abortion is illegal , or permitted only in exceptional situations .
for example , in El Salvador , where more than 7,000 cases of Zika were reported between December 2015 and January 2016 , abortions are illegal under all circumstances .
Miscarriages , if proven to be self @-@ induced , can even lead to homicide convictions .
the position of the United States hasn &apos;t helped , either .
last year , US President Barack Obama &apos;s administration asked Congress for $ 1.8 billion in emergency funding to help prepare for and respond to the Zika threat .
but abortion politics intervened , as Republican lawmakers , leading a congressional hearing on the Zika outbreak , made the funding conditional on anti @-@ abortion policies in recipient countries .
the problems with the dominant approach to containing the Zika virus - namely , that it saddles women with too much responsibility while giving them too little power - are not lost on everyone .
last year , the United Nations Refugee Agency and the World Health Organization emphasized the need to put human rights at the center of the response to the Zika outbreak .
but , while high @-@ level recognition of women &apos;s sexual and reproductive rights is a positive step , it is far from sufficient .
and doing what is needed to protect those rights , particularly among poor and vulnerable women in developing countries , will require deep and sustained political commitment .
in particular , national legislation must be revised to ensure that all women - whether they are carrying a baby with microcephaly or not - have full reproductive autonomy .
women must be able to base their reproductive choices on their own physical and emotional needs and desires , not on the moral judgments of powerful agents or risk of criminal sanctions .
advocacy groups in Brazil , for example , are already pushing for such an outcome , submitting legal cases to the Supreme Court to secure greater reproductive rights for women , including the right to safe and legal abortion .
those cases tend to lean on the 1988 National Constitution , which guarantees the right to abortion in case of rape , danger to the mother &apos;s life , or anencephaly , another birth defect involving the brain .
in pursuing these changes , campaigns should also recognize and address the links between women &apos;s and disability rights .
indeed , they should advance equality for all marginalized groups .
Zika &apos;s medium- and long @-@ term consequences must be addressed with this in mind .
when a woman gives birth to a child with a congenital syndrome deriving from the Zika virus , the response should be grounded in the dignity , value , and rights of each individual .
it should acknowledge the processes that keep certain individuals and groups in poverty and that deny them the basic rights of citizens .
that is why campaigners must insist that the state be responsible for providing appropriate care and support services for each woman and child - services that both meet their needs and respect their rights .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Last Chance
as the world rooted for former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan in his recent efforts to end the violence in Kenya , many also found themselves wondering whether a weary Annan , or some other global leader , will be battling another fire by the end of this month : this time in Zimbabwe .
Zimbabwe &apos;s upcoming elections , scheduled for March 29 , offer both fear and hope to the millions trapped in or trying to escape the country &apos;s hellish conditions .
even official data now put the inflation rate at more than 100,000 % , and the plight of ordinary Zimbabweans grows more desperate by the day .
the elections could bring Zimbabweans a chance to end the long dictatorship of President Robert Mugabe .
but , without supervision , they will be held in an environment that could dash Zimbabweans &quot; hopes .
Zimbabweans are denied their basic freedoms and subjected to violence .
torture is widespread .
civil society groups report the arrests of opposition electoral candidates , the manipulation of food supplies for political purposes , and violent incidents of voter intimidation .
the Zimbabwe Election Support Network has also expressed concern about the country &apos;s state of readiness for this complex election , which will combine presidential , parliamentary , senatorial , and local government contests .
and this is to say nothing of the structural faults that continue to impede political progress - a defective constitution , censored media , and a partisan security and military establishment .
it didn &apos;t have to be this way .
this past year has seen one missed opportunity after another .
South African president Thabo Mbeki convened negotiations with Zimbabwe &apos;s political groups ; but they have been so unfruitful that opposition leaders recently all but accused Mbeki of lying to the world about the progress of the talks .
some African leaders - notably Ghana &apos;s president , John Kufuor , and outgoing African Union head Alpha Konare - have tried to cajole Mugabe towards reform , to no avail .
perhaps more significantly , the international community &apos;s failure to address Zimbabwe seriously shows , once again , that it lacks the political will to prevent foreseeable crises .
last year , UN Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour condemned the regime &apos;s use of torture and its mistreatment of pro @-@ democracy forces .
regrettably , the UN failed to follow up with institutional action .
the UN would say it must be invited into a country before it can take certain forms of action , such as sending official election observers .
but it is also true that with adequate political will , the UN Security Council could live up to its responsibility to Zimbabweans by responding to the crisis more aggressively .
the UN should have put Mugabe on the defensive with a forceful public offer to help Zimbabwe prepare for internationally supervised elections .
instead , the UN continues to defer to Mugabe , who hides behind claims of sovereignty while jailing a defenseless populace .
with so many lives at stake , what can be done to avert an intensification of the Zimbabwe crisis ?
people of good will throughout the world , including those affiliated with multilateral organizations like the UN , should descend on Zimbabwe to observe this month &apos;s elections .
accredited or not , they should stand in solidarity with the people of Zimbabwe at this crucial moment , act as witnesses to the deteriorating pre @-@ election environment , and serve as a bulwark against any escalation of state brutality during and after the vote .
Mugabe would prefer to limit the presence of international observers to those sent by neighboring states - the same allies that somehow managed to deem the violent and fraudulent elections of the past seven years &quot; legitimate . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s neighbors also face a choice : they can use their proximity to halt Mugabe &apos;s abuses , or to shield him from international scrutiny and rebuke .
their choice may depend on what the world demands of them .
the people of Zimbabwe will play their part on March 29 .
as for the regional and world community , their actions today and in the coming weeks could make the difference between a reprise of the violence in Kenya and the first step towards a more stable and democratic future .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Permanent Guantánamo
Johannesburg - Last week , the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees at Guantánamo Bay have the right to habeas corpus - the right to challenge the factual and legal basis of their detention in a court of law . I was elated by the decision , having spent four years working on ensuring the rule of law in US detention and interrogation policy , including monitoring military commission trials at Guantánamo Bay . but my happiness is tempered by where I sit , close to the border with Zimbabwe - a country where the writ of habeas corpus and the rule of law have become obsolete .
habeas corpus , Latin for &quot; you have the body , &quot; is an old English common law principle incorporated into the US Constitution to ensure freedom from unlawful detention by the state .
it was and continues to be a critical check against the imprisonment of individuals without oversight by independent courts .
in Zimbabwe , this right - like so many other checks and balances - has been torn away by a repressive state .
just hours before the US Supreme Court ruling , Tendai Biti , the Secretary @-@ General of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , was arrested upon his return to Zimbabwe .
despite immediate attempts by his lawyers to locate him , his whereabouts remained unknown for days .
the police dismissed an initial court order demanding that Biti be produced before the court .
after Biti was finally produced before the court days later , the government announced that he will be charged with treason - which carries the death penalty - for unofficially announcing the results of the March 29 , 2008 , elections . prior to his detention , Biti had responded to such allegations by stating that his only crime was to fight for democracy in Zimbabwe .
it is unlikely that he will be able to challenge the basis of his detention in an independent court .
since 1999 , the MDC has offered a democratic alternative to President Robert Mugabe &apos;s regime .
in the most recent elections , Zimbabweans made their choice known , despite serious obstacles and widespread repression , with the MDC &apos;s presidential candidate , Morgan Tsvangirai , gaining more votes than Mugabe .
but , according to the vote counts released by the government after a suspicious month @-@ long delay , the MDC &apos;s margin of victory - 48 % to 43 % - fell short of the 50 % required to avoid a run @-@ off election .
Biti is not the only MDC member to be &quot; disappeared &quot; for a period of time by Mugabe &apos;s government .
over the past two years , police and government @-@ supported paramilitaries have routinely jailed , beaten , and even killed MDC officials and suspected MDC members .
last year , Biti was detained and beaten along with Tsvangirai and dozens of other MDC officials .
the photos of Tsvangirai &apos;s pummeled body led to an international outcry .
state @-@ sponsored violence against the MDC and its supporters has escalated as the June 27 run @-@ off vote draws near . just weeks ago , Biti described the discovery of the mutilated body of Tonderai Ndira , an MDC youth leader .
Ndira had been taken by the police from his home .
he was missing for seven days ; when his body was found , it was recognizable only by a Bracelet he always wore .
here in our offices in Johannesburg , we have two Zimbabwean lawyers who fled their country after receiving death threats for their work defending human rights .
at least five of their clients have been murdered in the past few weeks .
most recently , the Zimbabwean police suspended the work of numerous human rights organizations that were documenting the recent violence .
it is hard to imagine that a free and fair election can take place against the backdrop of such intense and systemic violence .
indeed , even South African president Thabo Mbeki , who , despite an outcry from many of his citizens , has supported Mugabe , felt compelled to label it a &quot; cause for serious concern . &quot;
in the majority opinion in Boumediene v. Bush , Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote that &quot; Liberty and security can be reconciled ; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law . &quot;
but there is no rule of law left in Zimbabwe - no habeas corpus and no check on arbitrary state action .
it is time for the international community to step in , call for an end to the detention and disappearance of MDC officials and perceived supporters , and push for a democratic transition in Zimbabwe .
only then can the principles underlying the Supreme Court &apos;s decision come within reach of ordinary Zimbabweans .
Zoellick to the Rescue ?
will newly anointed World Bank President Robert Zoellick be able to get the organization back on its feet after the catastrophic failed presidency of Paul Wolfowitz ?
although hardly a megawatt star of the Bob Rubin category , he certainly brings some positive attributes to the job .
first , as a key player in bringing China into the World Trade Organization , Zoellick is a proven internationalist in an American administration where internationalists have sometimes seemed like an endangered species .
second , he is a firm believer in the power of markets and free trade , which have clearly done far more to alleviate poverty over the past half @-@ century than any aid program .
third , he seems to have been a consistent behind @-@ the @-@ scenes supporter of the Bank , whereas many of his Bush administration colleagues would be just as happy to see it shut down and its Washington headquarters turned into private condominiums and offices .
so presumably he has a constructive vision for the Bank &apos;s future .
but Zoellick is not without his weaknesses .
first and foremost , his appointment extends the embarrassingly outmoded practice of always installing an American in the job .
with the Bank tirelessly preaching the merits of good governance , its failure to adopt democratic principles undercuts its own legitimacy .
the claim that the World Bank needs an American president to ensure that the US keeps donating money is ridiculous .
the annual cost of the US contribution to the World Bank , even taking into account off @-@ the @-@ books loan guarantees , is relatively minor .
any number of developing countries , from China to India to Brazil , could easily step up if the US foolishly stepped down .
Zoellick &apos;s background as a lawyer hardly makes him perfect for the job , either .
the World Bank presidency is not about negotiating treaties , as Zoellick did when he was US Trade Representative .
the Bank &apos;s most important role in development today is as a &quot; knowledge bank &quot; that helps aggregate , distill , and disseminate best practices from around the world .
in this respect , the Bank &apos;s technical assistance to governments is very similar to what private consultants offer to companies .
moreover , many of the World Bank president &apos;s most important decisions involve economics in an essential way .
wrong economic decisions , such as in the 1970 &quot; s , when Robert McNamara pushed grandiose , but environmentally devastating , infrastructure projects , have haunted the Bank for decades .
the biggest question mark , though , is whether Zoellick will be able to hit the ground running and implement desperately needed reforms .
reform number one , of course , is to ensure that the next World Bank President is not an American .
Rodrigo de Rato , Zoellick &apos;s counterpart at the European @-@ dominated International Monetary Fund , has already suggested that his successor should be chosen in a more inclusive process .
the World Bank should be ashamed that its president has not yet offered a similar proposal .
second , Zoellick should ask why the Bank spends only 2.5 % of its budget on the &quot; knowledge bank &quot; research function that it trumpets so proudly in its external relations materials , while it spends three times that amount on maintaining its executive board .
third , Zoellick should use his formidable negotiating skills to cajole rich countries into greatly increasing the grant component of World Bank aid .
the idea that a big government @-@ guaranteed global bank is needed to fill holes in private capital markets is laughable nowadays .
true , the Bank &apos;s poorest clients have little access to private capital markets .
by and large , however , the poorest countries need grants , not loans that they still won &apos;t be able to pay in 20 years .
as the Bank switches from loans to grants , it can use some of its massive retained earnings to endow its &quot; knowledge bank &quot; function and related technical advice .
but all this knowledge shouldn &apos;t be free .
a lot of technical advice falls on deaf ears , with countries listening only long enough to get their hands on Bank money .
instead of merely pushing its agenda , the Bank should start charging for its technical advice on a graduated scale so that more of its engagements are client @-@ driven .
last but not least , the Bank needs to play a much bigger role in environmental issues and , in general , in promoting good international citizenship by both rich and poor countries .
( some of us have been proposing this for almost two decades . )
of course , Zoellick could just attempt to fill the role symbolically and do little or nothing , as some of his predecessors have done .
or , less likely , he could embrace some megalomaniacal and over @-@ reaching vision of government intervention , as others have tried .
in any case , let &apos;s wish him luck .
the world needs the World Bank a lot more than it needs another condominium .
Zuma Rising
the anxiety over Jacob Zuma &apos;s election as president of South Africa obscures a significant milestone : for the first time in decades , a sub @-@ Saharan nation has at its helm a champion of ordinary people .
African politics has long been the exclusive domain of aristocrats , soldiers , and technocrats .
even with the spread of democratic elections , the region &apos;s leaders tend to come from the ranks of soldiers ( Uganda , Rwanda , Zimbabwe ) , family dynasties ( Togo , Kenya , etc ) , or university professors , lawyers , and economists ( Ghana , Malawi , Liberia ) .
now South Africa , the region &apos;s economic engine and home to its most sophisticated universities , media , and corporations , has a former goat herder at its helm , a rare African leader with the common touch .
Zuma is legendary for his ability to connect with ordinary people .
he &apos;s secure enough to dance and sing in public . he speaks the language of populism , raising hopes for the vast majority of South Africans who daily endure the misery of poor housing , schools , and health care .
in contrast to his two predecessors - the saintly Nelson Mandela , who emphasized racial healing , and the aristocratic Thabo Mbeki , who reassured financiers with his strong grasp of macroeconomics - Zuma recognizes the pent @-@ up demand for material improvement in the lives of his country &apos;s tens of millions of have @-@ nots .
&quot; we have learned from the mistakes of the past 15 years , especially the manner of which we may have , to some degree , neglected the people &apos;s movement , &quot; he said in April , before his African National Congress swept to victory .
until now , populism has been the missing note in African political culture .
Zuma , who spent his youth herding cattle and only gained formal education while in the notorious Robben Island prison with Mandela , is refreshingly aware that Africa &apos;s biggest problem is its inequalities , not its global marginalization .
in Africa &apos;s wealthiest nation - but also the nation where wealth is most unequally shared - a bold populist now holds ultimate power over government policy .
yet , while Zuma &apos;s populist appeal reflects South Africa &apos;s especially large differences in economic class , the threat of imposing higher taxes and other obligations on employers and the wealthy has raised fears at home and internationally .
moreover , Zuma has been called a chameleon , accused of telling his audiences what they want to hear .
Zuma &apos;s turbulent personal life - many wives and his embarrassing contention during a rape trial that he avoided HIV infection by taking a shower - has invited ridicule .
most seriously , doubts persist about his commitment to democracy , with critics arguing he &apos;s an old @-@ style African &quot; big man &quot; ready to bully opponents and ravage the public coffers with his cronies .
dismissing complaints , Zuma insists , &quot; There &apos;s no cloud around me . &quot;
his defenders , meanwhile , point to two benefits that he has already delivered : an end to Mbeki &apos;s ambivalent approach to fighting HIV / AIDS , the country &apos;s major public health threat , and a refreshing willingness to move against Zimbabwe &apos;s aged dictator , Robert Mugabe , whom Mbeki coddled out of a misguided sense of loyalty for his support during the struggle against apartheid .
in an Africa bereft of successful populist politicians , Zuma &apos;s role models may come from Latin America , where income inequality is also extreme and the trade @-@ union movement , as in South Africa , is strong and militant .
with enormous pressure from ordinary people to deliver tangible gains , Zuma the populist will quickly face a major test : will he emulate Lula of Brazil , who has struck an admirable balance between good economic governance and re @-@ distribution of wealth to the poor ?
or will he follow the path of Hugo Chávez , a popular autocrat who seems to prefer building a cult of personality over raising living standards for the poor .
the stakes for Africa are enormous .
South Africa has the continent &apos;s largest economy and , until the global financial crisis , posted 10 years of steady economic growth .
in an economic slowdown , the country &apos;s severe crime problem might only worsen ; so might unemployment , which already tops 20 % in the formal economy .
Zuma senses the urgency of the situation .
he is , after all , 67 years old and likely to serve only a single term in office .
&quot; we can &apos;t waste time , &quot; he says .
yet , according to the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki , at his core , &quot; Zuma is a conservative . &quot;
in this sense , Zuma represents yesterday &apos;s South Africa .
he is part of the proud generation that defeated apartheid - and then peacefully engineered a transition to durable black @-@ majority rule .
their achievement remains one of the greatest in recent history .
at the same time , Zuma &apos;s revolutionary generation still seems uneasy leading South Africa in a post @-@ apartheid era that is now 15 years old .
in a region that reveres the elderly , Zuma &apos;s attachment to his rural traditions must be matched by an equal openness to the appetites of the country &apos;s youth .
three in ten South Africans are younger than 15 , meaning that they did not live a day under apartheid .
somehow Zuma must find a way to honor his own generation &apos;s commitment to racial justice and national liberation , while empowering the masses who daily suffer the sting of class differences and yearn for material gain .
