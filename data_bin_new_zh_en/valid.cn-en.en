it is also widely understood that Pakistan has become part of the problem .
Pakistan &apos;s western reaches are now a sanctuary for militias and terrorists that are moving in and out of Afghanistan .
here , Barack Obama appears more willing to have the US launch unilateral military raids against terrorists should the opportunity arise .
but whoever is elected will confront difficult choices if a nuclear @-@ armed Pakistan remains unable or unwilling to act as an American partner and meet its responsibilities in the effort against terrorism .
a third area of some consensus ( and some distance from George W. Bush ) is climate change .
under the next president , the US will no longer be a drag on international efforts to create a global regime that sets a ceiling on greenhouse gas emissions .
one result of this likely evolution in US policy is that pressure will shift to other countries , particularly China and India , to accept some limits on their own economic behavior .
a President McCain or Obama will take steps to improve America &apos;s image in the world .
one of his first decisions will be to implement a ban on all forms of torture .
also to be expected early on is a decision to close the facility at Guantánamo Bay , where terrorism suspects have been held for years without trial .
Iran is another area where the differences - at least initially - may not be as sharp as the campaign suggests .
both candidates have stressed that an Iran with nuclear weapons would be unacceptable .
the victor will almost surely endorse a new diplomatic initiative aimed at ending Iran &apos;s independent ability to enrich uranium .
less clear are the details of such an initiative , or what the US would do if it were to fail .
the candidates &quot; statements on Iran do suggest two different philosophies of diplomacy .
Obama seems to regard meeting with foreign leaders as a normal component of foreign policy , to be employed as one of many tools .
McCain appears to embrace the view that such meetings are something of a reward , to be offered when preconditions are met ( Iran comes to mind ) and withdrawn when certain lines are crossed , as Russia was judged to have done this August in Georgia .
despite such differences , either would carry out policies closer to those of Bush &apos;s second term than his first .
with a strained military and a struggling economy , the next president will often have little choice other than to talk .
on other issues , such as trade , there are distinctions between the candidates .
McCain is a stronger advocate of free trade than Obama is .
but this difference may have less impact than meets the eye .
Congress plays a large role in trade policy , and the near certainty that the Democratic Party &apos;s majority in Congress will grow after the election means that protectionism will grow as well .
difficult economic times will make it hard to generate support for trade pacts , despite the current importance of export @-@ oriented firms for the American economy .
there are real and important differences between the two candidates when it comes to how they would approach the world .
but there are also more similarities than might be evident from the debates and the campaign .
aspects of the next president &apos;s foreign policy are there to see if observers read between the lines and take as much note of what is not said as what is .
what Went Wrong with America
the latest edition of the Pew Global Attitudes Survey shows that favorable opinions of the United States have fallen again in 12 out of 15 countries polled , a sad reflection of a country &apos;s loss of image .
how can America recover international legitimacy ?
this is probably one of the most important challenges for today &apos;s world , for America retains a unique power that should be used - and be perceived - as a force for good if global stability is to prevail .
nearly two decades after the demise of the Soviet empire , what stands out is a prevailing sense of lost opportunities .
the US had a unique opportunity at the end of the Cold War to use its benevolent and enlightened superiority to establish a better international order .
but , for a combination of political and personal reasons , America lost time under the two presidencies of Bill Clinton .
indeed , during this necessarily short and fragile &quot; unipolar moment , &quot; Clinton probably had an intuition of what America &apos;s new responsibilities should be , but he did not deliver .
the defeat of the Democrats in the mid @-@ term elections in 1994 , followed by the MONICA Lewinsky affair , hampered the effectiveness of one of America &apos;s most energetic and gifted Presidents .
that failure was epitomized by the inability to impose a peace agreement on Palestinians and Israelis in 2000 .
by contrast , George W. Bush did not lose time .
he did worse : he simply took a wrong turn - and he took it before 9 / 11 , a traumatic event that reinforced , but did not create , America &apos;s Manichean view of itself and its role in the world .
three recent examples illustrate what went wrong with America , its loss of unique status , and its growing image as a partisan and unethical , if not destabilizing , force in the world .
consider , first , the recent nuclear agreement signed between the US and India .
in strictly legal terms , there is nothing wrong , since India never signed the Nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty .
but in psychological and political terms , the deal signed could only be perceived as legitimizing for Iran &apos;s nuclear ambitions , not to mention North Korea &apos;s .
it was the ultimate proof that the Bush administration does not believe in universal norms .
a &quot; good &quot; country would be treated with extreme leniency , whereas a &quot; bad &quot; country would not .
Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , and more recent war @-@ crimes scandals have done much worse damage to America &apos;s stature .
regimes that systematically violate human rights have been quick to seize on every episode of US wrongdoing .
with its own human rights record in question , the US , which had been the democratic teacher of the post @-@ war world , is in a much weaker position to give lessons and set standards .
nor does the appearance of hypocrisy end there .
at a time when &quot; democracy &quot; and &quot; democratization &quot; have become the watchwords of US foreign policy , normalization of diplomatic relations with Gaddafi &apos;s Libya , not to mention leniency towards Egypt and Saudi Arabia hardly boosts America &apos;s credibility .
in global terms , the contrast between what America says and what it does has become glaring .
in February 2005 , in a major speech in Paris during her first foreign trip as Secretary of State , Condoleezza Rice stated America &apos;s ambition in the world .
she said essentially the following : &quot; the role of the world is to improve the world .
America , as the most powerful and ethical country in the world , has a unique responsibility to perform . &quot;
eighteen months later , the results are falling far short of the goal .
on the contrary , the failures of US policy have contributed to reduce the legitimacy of America &apos;s power further .
despite the recent death of Zarqawi in Iraq , the situation there , and in Afghanistan , does not justify the continued Bush administration &apos;s optimism .
as America &apos;s legitimacy diminishes , new actors are appearing on the world stage - or returning for an encore .
Russia and China today are united not only by their energy deals , but also by both countries &quot; conviction that their time has come , and that the outside world needs them more than they need the outside world , particularly the US .
in strategic terms , the waning influence of a paralyzed Europe is also very bad news for America .
the US needs allies now more than ever , for the world is reverting to its pre @-@ war multi @-@ polar state .
of course , given America &apos;s objective military superiority , I would call it &quot; asymmetrical multi @-@ polarity . &quot;
but the US is no longer the country that others seek to emulate , or that they look to for global leadership .
it is too early to dismiss America and proclaim the end of an imperial moment .
America retains unique qualities - particularly its ability to rebound .
the next US president should be able to capitalize on Americans &quot; fundamental optimism , pragmatism , and activism .
but he or she will face an uphill struggle to prove to the world that America can be a force for good , a democratic beacon that cares for the planet and that lives up to the standards that it sets for others .
what We owe Egypt
Cambridge - The question that still underlies much thinking about economic development is this : what can we do to kick @-@ start economic growth and reduce poverty around the world ?
the &quot; we &quot; is sometimes the World Bank , sometimes the United States and other rich countries , and sometimes professors of development economics and their students huddled in a seminar room .
it is on this question that the entire development @-@ aid complex is based .
but what has transformed Tunisia , Egypt , and Libya over the last two years has not been efforts by the outside world to improve these societies or their economies , but grassroots social movements intent on changing their countries &quot; political systems .
it started in Tunisia , where the revolution swept President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali &apos;s repressive regime out of power . it then spread to Egypt and Libya , ending Hosni Mubarak &apos;s and Muammar el @-@ Qaddafi &apos;s even more repressive and corrupt regimes .
the people who poured into the streets and risked their lives were fed up with the repression and the poverty that these regimes caused .
the average Egyptian &apos;s income level , for example , is just 12 % of the average American &apos;s , and Egyptians can expect to die 10 years sooner .
fully 20 % of the population lives in dire poverty .
the protesters in Tahrir Square perceived the cause of Egypt &apos;s poverty in its non @-@ responsive , repressive political system , its corrupt government , and the general lack of equality of opportunity in every sphere of their lives .
they saw their current leaders as part of the problem , not part of the solution .
by contrast , most outsiders , asking &quot; What can we do ? , &quot; emphasized geographic or cultural factors , or some purely economic &quot; poverty trap , &quot; whose effects should be countered by foreign aid and advice .
there should be no illusion that the transformation that the protesters started will be smooth .
many previous revolutions have deposed one set of corrupt rulers only to bring in a new bunch who are equally corrupt , vicious , and repressive .
there is also no guarantee that the previous elites will not be able to re @-@ constitute similar regimes .
indeed , the military , the bulwark of Mubarak &apos;s regime , is now in charge in Egypt , and has been repressing , jailing , and killing protesters who dare to stand up .
most recently , it has unveiled plans to write a new constitution before the presidential election , and its electoral commission has disqualified 10 of the 23 presidential candidates on flimsy grounds .
and , if the military loosens the reins , the Muslim Brotherhood could take over and form its own authoritarian , non @-@ representative regime .
but there are also grounds to be optimistic .
the genie is out of the bottle , and people know that they have the power to topple governments , and , more generally , that their political activism has consequences .
that is why people have continued to fill Tahrir Square whenever the military has tried to consolidate its power and suppress dissent .
though it is ultimately the Egyptian people who will decide the country &apos;s fate , and whether it can finally take decisive steps towards more inclusive political institutions , this does not mean that outsiders can do nothing .
in fact , there is much that &quot; we &quot; can do - even if none of it will be central to the outcome .
for example , the US will again give more than $ 1.5 billion of aid to Egypt this year .
but who is receiving that aid ?
unfortunately , it is not the people who are trying to change their country &apos;s future , but the Egyptian military and the same politicians who ruled Egypt under the previous regime .
the least we owe to the Egyptian people is to stop supporting their repression .
that does not mean cutting foreign aid .
on the contrary , though foreign aid will not by itself transform Egypt &apos;s society or economy , and though some of it will inevitably be wasted and fall into the wrong hands , it can still do some good .
more important , the US and the international community can work to ensure that the bulk of the funds go not to the military and to business @-@ as @-@ usual politicians , but to grassroots causes and groups .
in fact , foreign aid can also be used as a small inducement for national dialogue in Egypt .
for example , foreign aid could be placed under the stewardship of a committee of representatives from different social factions , including the civil @-@ society groups at the center of the uprising and the Muslim Brotherhood , with the clear understanding that if the committee fails to agree , the aid will not be disbursed .
this would force the military and the elites to work together with opposition groups that they often attempt to sideline .
beyond bringing important but politically marginalized groups to the table , such a committee might also produce a demonstration effect , with successful power @-@ sharing in a small setting possibly encouraging power @-@ sharing writ large .
that may not be the sort of outside intervention that could cure the ills of centuries of repression and underdevelopment overnight , but &quot; we &quot; need to stop searching for a non @-@ existent panacea , and instead do something better than feeding the Egyptian military .
when Democracies collide
Berlin - The multipolar nature of today &apos;s international system will again be on display at the upcoming G @-@ 20 summit in Los Cabos , Mexico .
global problems are no longer solved , crises managed , or global rules defined , let alone implemented , the old @-@ fashioned way , by a few , mostly Western , powers .
incipient great and middle powers , such as India , Brazil , Indonesia , South Korea , Turkey , and South Africa , also demand their say .
some of these powers are still emerging economies .
politically , however , most of them have crossed the threshold that has long limited their access to the kitchen of international decision @-@ making .
the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council ( the &quot; P @-@ 5 &quot; ) still defend their right to veto resolutions , and their military power is unmatched .
but they can no longer dispose of sufficient resources , competence , and legitimacy to cope with global challenges or crises on their own .
bipolarity is a thing of the past , and it is unlikely to re @-@ emerge in a new Sino @-@ American &quot; G @-@ 2 . &quot;
it is equally unlikely for the foreseeable future that any one club of countries , such as the G @-@ 7 or G @-@ 8 , will again assume a quasi @-@ hegemonic position .
even the G @-@ 20 in its current composition may not really represent the forces that can and will shape the twenty @-@ first century .
for the Unites States , the European Union , Japan , and other members of the &quot; Old West , &quot; the good news is that most of the emerging powers that are positioning themselves for a more active global role are also democracies .
within the G @-@ 20 , only two states - China and Saudi Arabia - explicitly do not want to be liberal democracies , while a third , Russia , has developed into an autocracy with a democratic façade .
the not @-@ so @-@ good news is that these new democratic powers do not necessarily share the Old West &apos;s political agenda .
for example , they differ about climate policies , seeing a threat to development .
similarly , while new middle and great powers do not always agree , they are generally more skeptical of both international sanctions and military interventions .
moreover , some of the most important of these states differ substantially with the US , and often also with the EU , about the right approach toward regional conflicts , especially in the Middle East .
thus , in 2010 , the US found itself in a serious diplomatic dispute with Turkey and Brazil about how to resolve the conflict with Iran over its nuclear program .
without actually admitting it , the US was clearly unhappy that these two states tried to play a diplomatic role of their own in the dispute .
differences are also apparent where new democratic middle or great powers have formed new groups or clubs , such as the BRICS , together with non @-@ democratic powers .
India , Brazil , and South Africa are using such formats in a pragmatic way to pursue their interests , or simply to demonstrate their increased international weight .
there is little agreement between them and Russia or China - both P @-@ 5 members - with regard to political values or to fundamental questions of international order .
along with many other states in the global South , however , Russia and China tend to defend the principle of non @-@ interference , and they are generally reluctant to support any US or European attempts to project democracy or defend human rights in other countries .
not a few policymakers in the US and in Europe have reacted with astonishment , or even annoyance , to these emerging democratic powers &quot; attempts to pursue their own agendas on the world stage .
such reactions partly reflect old thinking rooted in the Cold War , when democratic countries might differ over details , but would agree about the main questions of international politics .
those who pursued a different agenda on substantial matters were either not part of the &quot; democratic camp &quot; or were not important international players .
by contrast , a central feature of today &apos;s globalized , multipolar world is that shared democratic values do not guarantee agreement about substantial questions of international politics .
the more democracies there are , the more conflicts of interests and differences are likely to emerge between democratic countries .
there is little reason to react with anger when states like Turkey , Brazil , and South Africa set priorities different from those of Europe or the US , or have different views about how to deal with the Arab @-@ Israeli conflict , Iran , development aid , democracy promotion , or environmental protection .
the US example shows clearly that democratic great powers often pursue their interests with little regard for a global common good that others have defined .
in other words , the international order is becoming more pluralistic .
the task for established Western democracies is to accept and cope with such &quot; democratic differences &quot; on the international level , and to seek multilateral coalitions to manage or solve problems .
in principle , the EU is better positioned than the US ( and certainly than China ) to take on this task .
Europeans are well practiced in dealing with differences and shaping consensus among principally like @-@ minded states .
that said , Europe needs to learn to be clearer and more transparent about the interests underlying its own policies , rather than suggesting that its positions on a specific subject represent the only rational implementation of democratic values and norms .
when France Says No
not long ago , an American political analyst compared France &apos;s loss of influence in Europe following its &quot; No &quot; vote in the 2005 referendum on the EU constitutional treaty with France &apos;s surrender in 1940 .
a provocative analogy , but is it apt ?
the collapse in 1940 revealed the fragility of France &apos;s democracy and its loss of confidence in the country &apos;s capacity to face outside threats .
in rejecting the European constitution , France expressed its fear of , among other things , globalization .
a better analogy for the No vote was the rejection in 1954 of the treaty to establish a European Defense Community ( EDC ) .
in both cases , a major historical mistake was made .
France had to a large extent initiated both treaties , had managed to get them accepted by its European partners , but in the end vetoed its own undertakings .
why , in both 1954 and 2005 , did the French - in one case the National Assembly , in the other the electorate - reject proposals that France itself had conceived ?
both projects sought to construct a genuinely supranational Europe .
the EDC would have created a European army , in which even German troops would have been included .
the proposed defense treaty was also to be buttressed by plans for a European political community whose main features were to be defined by a constitutional commission made up of members of national parliaments .
in effect , this commission would have been the precursor to the 2003 @-@ 2004 Convention for the Future of Europe , which , presided over by former French President Valéry Giscard d &apos;Estaing drafted the constitutional treaty .
the political community of the 1950 &quot; s that France had persuaded its five European partners to accept was supposed to absorb both the European Coal and Steel Community and the EDC .
it was to have both diplomatic and military powers , as well as a legislative assembly much like today &apos;s European Parliament - just as the 2005 EU constitutional plan would have extended the European Parliament &apos;s powers and created a European minister of foreign affairs .
but now , as back then , fear and doubt won the day .
political parties and others who mobilized opposition to the EDC feared a remilitarized Germany and a threat to France &apos;s sovereignty .
today , those in France who opposed the EU constitution succeeded in stigmatizing &quot; Europe &quot; as the threat .
they trumpeted France &apos;s invasion by &quot; Polish plumbers , &quot; calling into question Europe &apos;s two principal achievements : the introduction of a single market , which has undeniably boosted the French economy , and EU enlargement , which has done so much to foster democratic transition in new member states .
but the failure of the referendum in France carries more serious consequences than the EDC &apos;s rejection .
back in the 1950 &quot; s , the founding nations &quot; foreign ministers promptly turned to their Belgian colleague , Paul @-@ Henri Spaak , for fresh proposals .
after intensive discussion among the six , and especially between France and Germany , the Treaty of Rome was drawn up and signed within two years of the EDC debacle .
by contrast , two years after the French and Dutch No votes , there is no sign of a Plan B , despite the claims of the French politicians who helped mobilize the No vote .
Europe &apos;s Franco @-@ German locomotive has broken down and ratification has stopped , even though member states that had yet to ratify the treaty could have completed the process of ratification .
France &apos;s loss of influence in Europe is no longer at stake today , because the notion of influence presupposes that the overriding preoccupation of EU member states is to advance their own national interests .
if Europe were only about gaining the upper hand , it would generate perpetual conflict .
the reality is that Europe does manage to move ahead , but step by step through mutual compromise .
the real question has more to do with France &apos;s credibility and its capacity to remain a driving force in Europe .
a journalist recently expressed the view that France &apos;s special role in Europe was due to its &quot; centrality , &quot; meaning that the French are , in equal measure , both open to the world and attached to their nation .
they also participate successfully in a market economy while seeking to preserve an egalitarian social model .
the No vote sullied this image of a balanced France .
indeed , the French themselves are among the first to lament their bleak situation , inventing a new concept - &quot; la déclinologie &quot; - to describe this loss of self @-@ confidence .
moreover , the No vote has given a new legitimacy to euro @-@ skepticism in other member states .
to be sure , the rise of populism in Europe was not caused by the French ; nationalism is deeply rooted in Europe &apos;s history and has many causes .
but France &apos;s referendum result fueled other European governments &quot; fears that any new proposal they might put forward to re @-@ launch the EU constitution would fail in the face of domestic and Europe @-@ wide opposition .
but reducing European aspirations to the goals of Realpolitik is no answer to today &apos;s crisis .
Europeans need to recognize that strength lies in unity , and that Europe &apos;s integration cannot be guaranteed without a common constitutional framework that promotes a common identity .
until we think in terms of European sovereignty , rather than fret over risks to national sovereignty , the present crisis cannot be overcome .
when India Votes
Kerala , INDIA - Beginning this month , the largest exercise of the democratic franchise in history will take place , as India n voters head to the polls to elect a new national parliament .
they have done this 14 times since India gained its independence .
each time India has voted has been the world &apos;s largest exercise in electoral democracy .
India &apos;s growing population keeps breaking its own record .
this time , the electorate includes 714 million voters , an increase of 43 million over the previous general election in 2004 .
votes will be cast in 828,804 polling stations scattered throughout the country for over 5000 candidates from seven national political parties and several state and other parties . the process involves four million electoral officials and 6.1 million police and civilian personnel .
the numbers involved are so huge that the elections will be staggered over five phases , ending only on May 13 , with electoral and security personnel being moved from state to state as polling is concluded in each place .
despite the phased voting , the counting takes place nationwide immediately after the last phase , and the results of the elections everywhere will be announced on May 16 .
a new parliament will be convened on June 2 to elect a national government to succeed the outgoing administration of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
India &apos;s elections , conducted by the autonomous ( and all @-@ powerful ) Election Commission of India , are an extraordinary event , and not just because of their sheer scale .
it takes the felling of a sizeable forest to furnish enough paper for 714 million ballots , and every election has at least one story of officers battling through snow or jungle , or traveling by elephant and camel , to ensure that the democratic wishes of remote constituents are duly recorded .
( there is even one polling booth for a single voter , who lives too far from civilization to travel to another polling station . )
nor is any Indian election complete without the media publishing at least one picture of a female voter whose enthusiasm for the suffrage is undimmed by the fact that she is old , blind , crippled , toothless , purdah @-@ clad , or any combination of the above .
the exotica do not end there .
because so many voters are illiterate , India invented the party symbol , so that voters who cannot read the name of their candidate can vote for him or her anyway by recognizing the symbol under which they campaigned .
symbols range from the open palm of the ruling Indian National Congress to the Lotus of the Bharatiya Janata Party and variants of the hammer and sickle for India &apos;s profusion of Communist parties .
independent candidates can choose from an assortment of alternatives , ranging from a cricket bat to images of various large animals .
( small ones were removed from the list when one candidate , running against another whose symbol was a parrot , wrung the neck of a live parrot at a public meeting to signify what he would do to his rival . )
India was also the first country to use an indelible stain on the voter &apos;s fingernail to signify that he has already cast his ballot .
at every election , someone &quot; discovers &quot; a new chemical that will remove the stain and permit one to vote twice , though this is unlikely to make a great difference in constituencies the size of India &apos;s , where each MP represents more than two million people .
likewise , some distinguished voter invariably claims that his name is missing from the rolls , or that someone has already cast his vote ( but usually not both ) .
in any case , India &apos;s elections have a reputation for honesty .
in this election , as in previous ones , votes will be cast on electronic voting machines invented in India , which combine the virtues of simplicity , reliability , and ruggedness .
the electoral rolls carry photographs of every individual voter , as does each voter &apos;s identity card .
the elections have also been increasingly free of violence .
there was a time when , in certain parts of India , workers could stuff ballot boxes for a candidate and political parties could &quot; capture &quot; polling booths . electronic voting machines and strict security arrangements have largely eliminated that possibility .
it has been some time since there were reports of the occasional election worker , candidate , or voter being assaulted , kidnapped , or shot .
nothing ( short of the death of a major contender ) interrupts the franchise .
elections are an enduring spectacle of free India , and give foreign journalists the opportunity to remind the world that India is the world &apos;s largest democracy .
indeed , Indians now take for granted that elections will take place , that they will be free and fair , and that they will result in actual transfers of power .
there are few developing countries in the world where this is true , and fewer still where poverty and illiteracy are both rife .
that may be the real miracle of what will occur in India over the next few weeks .
the Myth of khaki Democracy
new YORK - Egypt and Thailand have little in common , except for one thing .
in both countries , at different times , educated people who pride themselves on being democrats have ended up applauding military coups against elected governments .
they had resisted oppressive military regimes for many years .
but , in Thailand in 2006 , as in Egypt last month , they were happy to see their political leaders ousted by force .
this perversity is not without reason .
the elected leaders in both countries , Thaksin Shinawatra in Thailand and Mohamed Morsi in Egypt , were good examples of illiberal democrats : they tended to view their electoral success as a mandate to manipulate constitutional norms and behave like autocrats .
they are not alone in this respect .
in fact , they are probably typical of leaders in countries with little or no history of democratic government .
Turkey &apos;s prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , is in the same camp .
and if the leaders of Algeria &apos;s Islamic Salvation Front ( FIS ) had been allowed to take power in 1991 , after their early success in a democratic election , they would almost certainly have been illiberal rulers .
( instead , they were crushed by a military coup , before a second round of elections could take place , triggering a brutal eight @-@ year civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people died . )
the aftermath of the 2006 coup in Thailand was not nearly so bloody .
but the bitterness lingers among Shinawatra &apos;s supporters - even now , when his sister , Yingluck , is Prime Minister .
Street violence is a constant threat .
only the frail and ailing 85 @-@ year @-@ old King Bhumibol Adulyadej still functions as a symbol of national cohesion .
without him , fighting between the rural poor and the urban elites could quickly erupt again .
this does not bode well for Thai democracy .
another military intervention is the last thing the country needs .
in Egypt , things look far worse at the moment .
the leader of the military coup , General Abdul @-@ Fattah al @-@ Sisi , has promised to confront Morsi &apos;s Muslim Brotherhood with maximum force .
in two separate incidents in July , security forces opened fire on supporters of the Brotherhood as they peacefully protested against Morsi &apos;s ouster and arrest , killing almost 200 people .
secret @-@ police units that were active under former President Hosni Mubarak ( and known for their frequent use of torture ) are being reconstituted for the first time since the 2011 revolution .
none of this is either democratic or liberal .
and yet many Egyptians , including some human @-@ rights activists , have endorsed it .
one man , who was savagely stomped by a member of the armed forces in Tahrir Square in 2011 , now claims that the Egyptian people should &quot; stand together &quot; with the military , and that all Muslim Brotherhood leaders should be arrested .
a prominent democracy activist , Esraa Abdel Fattah , has denounced Morsi &apos;s party as a gang of foreign @-@ backed terrorists .
the army leadership is saying the same thing : special measures , maximum force , and revived security units are all necessary to &quot; fight terrorism . &quot;
some foreign commentators have been as deluded as Egyptians who back the coup .
a well @-@ known Dutch novelist voiced a rather typical response , saying that he didn &apos;t care much what happened to Morsi &apos;s supporters , for they were all &quot; Islamo @-@ fascists &quot; anyway .
and foreign governments , including that of the United States , are averting their eyes .
President Barack Obama &apos;s administration refuses to describe what happened as a &quot; coup . &quot; US Secretary of State John Kerry even claimed that the military was &quot; restoring democracy . &quot;
there is no doubt that Morsi &apos;s government was inexperienced , often incompetent , and showed little interest in listening to views other than those of its supporters , which were often far from liberal .
but Morsi &apos;s people are not foreign @-@ backed terrorists .
nor was Morsi an Egyptian version of Iran &apos;s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini .
the election that brought Morsi to power gave a political voice for the first time to millions of people , many of them poor , uneducated , and religious .
they may not have been very good democrats , or even particularly tolerant of different views .
many of them had opinions - for example , on the role of women , on sex , and on the place of Islam in public life - that secular liberals find abhorrent .
but silencing these people by force , and calling them foreign @-@ backed terrorists , can have only one result : more violence .
if the outcomes of democratic elections are not respected , people will seek other means to make themselves heard .
Morsi &apos;s autocratic inclinations may have damaged democracy ; taking him out in a coup deals it a mortal blow .
how to bridge the gap in developing countries between secular , more or less Westernized urban elites and the rural poor is an old question .
one solution is to enforce secular modernization by oppressing the poor and their religious organizations .
Egypt has already endured the harsh rule of secular police states , of both the right and the left .
the other solution is to give democracy a chance .
this is not possible without allowing some form of religious expression in public life .
no democracy in the Middle East that fails to take account of Islam will work .
but , without the freedom to express other views and beliefs , democracy will remain illiberal .
this is hard for Islamist parties to accept .
many Islamists may in fact prefer an illiberal to a liberal democracy .
but liberals who truly favor democracy must accept that Islamists are entitled to play a political role , too .
the alternative is to revert to illiberal autocracy .
applauding the military coup against Morsi makes this the more likely outcome .
when Marijuana is Legal
Brisbane - What will happen if Californians votes this November to legalize marijuana use by any adult over the age of 21 years ?
let &apos;s ignore for the moment the vexed constitutional issues that will be raised if a US state enacts legislation that conflicts with federal law . let &apos;s focus instead on what may happen if the law changes as the referendum proposes .
if we are to believe the referendum &apos;s supporters , all Californians will be winners .
the change will legitimize marijuana &apos;s de facto legal status since passage of Proposition 215 in 1996 .
it will thus reduce state expenditure on enforcing a widely violated law ; remove marijuana growing and selling from the black market ; enable any adult who wishes to use marijuana to do so ; and introduce a tax on legal marijuana sales that will fill state coffers with revenue that formerly went to illegal growers ( so long as there is no large @-@ scale tax evasion ) .
by contrast , opponents predict that the change will increase rates of marijuana use , and thus magnify the harm arising from that use .
the adverse consequences of greatest concern include more marijuana @-@ related road traffic accidents and deaths ; more psychoses and other serious mental health problems among heavy users ; and heavier marijuana use by young people , negatively affecting their life chances .
these effects , they argue , will more than offset any gains from tax revenue and savings from law enforcement .
it is difficult to know who is right , because no other country has adopted this policy .
the Netherlands , which is popularly believed to have legalized cannabis use along these lines , has in fact tolerated only small @-@ scale retail sales of marijuana in a limited number of coffee shops in its larger cities .
marijuana cultivation remains illegal and coffee shop sales are regulated - more strictly in recent years in response to complaints from neighboring countries about &quot; drug tourism . &quot;
nevertheless , some broad predictions can be made .
first , openly tolerating a market in a previously illegal commodity will expand the number of users , especially if the retail price is lower than the black @-@ market price ( as is proposed in the Ammiano Bill currently before the California legislature ) . use may not increase immediately , but it will over time , because marijuana will become more freely available , much cheaper ( in order to discourage the persistence of a black market ) , and its use will be implicitly condoned .
experience with alcohol suggests that marijuana will be available to underage users ( as it is now ) , whatever the minimum legal age .
thus , legally available cheaper marijuana will probably mean more use by more young people , and probably more daily use later into adulthood .
in general , the more people who use a drug , the larger the number of problem users there will be ( on the reasonable assumption that problem users comprise a fixed proportion of all users ) .
if current estimates are correct , around 10 % of users ( and one in six who start in adolescence ) may become dependent on marijuana - that is , find it difficult to control or discontinue their use .
a minority of these problem users will seek professional help to quit .
dependent marijuana users are more likely to experience road and workplace accidents ( if they drive or work while intoxicated ) ; increased respiratory disease ( if they smoke marijuana ) ; exacerbations of some serious mental disorders ; and impaired school and work performance .
it is uncertain how far these adverse effects can be mitigated by preventive measures such as implementing roadside drug @-@ testing programs , persuading users to use vaporizers rather than smoke joints , discouraging young people from using marijuana , and encouraging early treatment for problem users .
experience with alcohol suggests that these approaches may modestly reduce , but not eliminate , the harms associated with use , especially if sellers are allowed to promote their wares .
indeed , the scale of any increase in marijuana use will critically depend on how tightly regulated marijuana sales are - how many licensed growers there are , the number of sales outlets , their locations and trading hours , eligibility requirements for use , content of THC ( marijuana &apos;s psychoactive ingredient ) , and how much promotion and advertising is allowed .
if marijuana were allowed to be marketed much like alcohol is now , we could expect more problem users than if it were regulated more like pharmaceutical drugs ( say , by requiring users to be licensed ; restricting the number of sales locations , hours of sale , and licensed growers ; and imposing high rates of taxation on higher @-@ THC marijuana ) .
it will be a major policy challenge to get this balance right .
greater restrictions would provide incentives for illegal operators to remain , while less restrictive regulation would discourage black marketeers , but at the price of increasing the number of users and problem users .
marijuana policy involves a choice between the evils of current repressive policies and the evils of increased use under a legal market .
Californians will have to decide how much weight to give to respect for adult liberty , protection of minors , avoidance of a large @-@ scale black market , fiscal considerations , and protection of marijuana users &quot; health .
if they vote for legalization , it will probably be 20 years or more before anyone can say whether , on balance , they decided wisely .
when Prevention is Better than Relief
Princeton - When the earthquake and tsunami hit Japan in March , Brian Tucker was in Padang , Indonesia .
Tucker was working with a colleague to design a refuge that could save thousands of lives if - or rather , when - a tsunami like the one in 1797 that came out of the Indian Ocean , some 600 miles southeast of where the 2004 Asian tsunami originated , strikes again .
Tucker is the founder and president of Geohazards International , a nonprofit organization whose mission is to reduce death and suffering due to earthquakes in the world &apos;s most vulnerable communities .
Padang is one of those communities .
just to its northwest , in Banda Aceh , 160,000 lives were lost in the 2004 tsunami .
now , geologists say , the fault that triggered that tsunami is most likely to rupture farther south , putting low @-@ lying coastal towns like Padang , with a population of 900,000 , at high risk of a major earthquake and tsunami within the next 30 years .
in Banda Aceh , the tsunami killed more than half the city &apos;s population .
in Padang , according to an estimate by the director of the city &apos;s disaster management office , a similar tsunami could kill more than 400,000 people .
Tucker says that he has stood on the beach in Padang , looking out at the ocean and trying to imagine what it would be like to see a five @-@ meter @-@ high wall of water stretching across the horizon , bearing down on the city .
now that we have seen the footage of the tsunami that hit Japan , the demands on our imagination have been lessened - except that we have to imagine away the sea walls that Japan had built to reduce the impact of the tsunami .
true , those walls did not work as well as had been hoped , but Japan was nonetheless much better prepared for a tsunami than Padang is .
in Padang , even with advance warning of a tsunami , higher ground is too far away , and the narrow streets too choked with traffic , for many people to get to safety in time .
Geohazards International is therefore working on a more practical idea , which it calls a Tsunami evacuation raised Earth Park ( TEREP ) .
the idea is to build small hills in low @-@ lying parts of the city , with level tops that could be used as parks or sports fields .
with the few minutes &quot; warning that an earthquake &apos;s strong shaking would automatically provide , people could walk to a TEREP and be safe above the highest level a tsunami could reach .
such raised earth parks are a low @-@ cost solution to the tsunami danger in low @-@ lying coastal areas .
they use only local materials , provide a valuable community resource in normal times , and have the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives when a tsunami strikes .
nevertheless , Geohazards International lacks the resources to build anything like enough TEREPs to meet the need .
after 20 years of operation , the organization remains tiny , especially when compared to organizations like the Red Cross , which primarily do disaster relief work .
people are willing to donate hundreds of millions of dollars to help people after a disaster - even after a disaster in a wealthy country like Japan - but are unwilling to invest anything like the same amount to save lives before a predictable disaster strikes .
one reason for this is that preventing a disaster does not make good television .
people give to identifiable victims .
if we build raised earth parks , we will never see the people who , but for our aid , would have died ; no orphans in desperate need will appear on the nightly news .
but isn &apos;t it much better to keep parents safe than to help orphans after their parents have been killed ?
this is a situation in which we must stretch our imagination , to understand and be motivated by the good that we are doing .
unfortunately , not everyone can do that .
another reason why we do not give to prevent disasters should be familiar to anyone who has ever delayed going to the dentist because the prospect of serious pain in the coming weeks or months just wasn &apos;t as motivating as the reluctance to face some more immediate slight discomfort .
we tell ourselves that maybe we won &apos;t get a toothache after all , even though we know that the odds are that we will .
most of us are not very good at giving proper weight to future events , especially if they are uncertain .
so we may tell ourselves that the geologists could be wrong , and perhaps no tsunami will hit Padang in the next 30 years , and by then perhaps we will have new and better technologies for predicting them , giving people more time to get to higher ground .
instead , we should be guided by the best estimates of the chances that an intervention will save lives , as well as by the number of lives that would be saved , and the cost of saving those lives .
the evidence suggests that building raised earth parks in places like Padang is very good value indeed .
when Technophobia Becomes Toxic
Stanford - During the late 1990 &quot; s , a singular phenomenon appeared in countries around the world .
one after another , food and beverage companies capitulated to activists opposed to a promising new technology : the genetic engineering of plants to produce ingredients .
they are still capitulating to this day .
the Japanese brewer Kirin and the Danish brewer Carlsberg eliminated genetically engineered ingredients from their beers .
in the United States , the fast @-@ food giant McDonald &apos;s banned them from its menu ; food manufacturers Heinz and Gerber ( then a division of Switzerland @-@ based Novartis ) dropped them from their baby @-@ food lines ; and Frito @-@ Lay demanded that its growers stop planting corn engineered to contain a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation .
these measures were rationalized in various ways , but the reality is that by yielding to the demands of a minuscule number of disingenuous activists , the companies opted to offer less safe products to consumers , thereby exposing themselves to legal jeopardy .
every year , innumerable packaged @-@ food products worldwide are withheld or recalled from the market due to the presence of &quot; all natural &quot; contaminants like insect parts , toxic molds , bacteria , and viruses .
because farming takes place outdoors and in dirt , such contamination is a fact of life .
over the centuries , the main culprit in mass food poisoning often has been contamination of unprocessed crops by fungal toxins - a risk that is exacerbated when insects attack food crops , opening wounds that allow fungi ( molds ) to get a foothold .
for example , fumonisin and some other fungal toxins are highly toxic , causing esophageal cancer in humans and fatal diseases in livestock that eat infected corn .
Fumonisin also interferes with the cellular uptake of folic acid , a vitamin that reduces the risk of neural tube defects in developing fetuses , and thus can cause folic acid deficiency - and defects such as spina bifida - even when one &apos;s diet contains what otherwise would be sufficient amounts of the vitamin .
many regulatory agencies have therefore established recommended maximum fumonisin levels permitted in food and feed products made from corn .
the conventional way to meet those standards and prevent the consumption of fungal toxins is simply to test unprocessed and processed grains and discard those found to be contaminated - an approach that is both wasteful and failure @-@ prone .
but modern technology - specifically , the genetic engineering of plants using recombinant DNA technology ( also known as food biotechnology or genetic modification ) - offers a way to prevent the problem .
contrary to the claims of food @-@ biotech critics , who insist that genetically modified crops pose risks ( none of which has actually occurred ) of new allergens or toxins in the food supply , such products offer the food industry a proven and practical means of tackling the fungal contamination at its source .
an excellent example is corn that is crafted by splicing into commercial varieties a gene ( or genes ) from a harmless bacterium .
the bacterial genes express proteins that are toxic to corn @-@ boring insects , but that are harmless to birds , fish , and mammals , including humans . as the modified corn fends off insect pests , it also reduces the levels of the mold Fusarium , thereby reducing the levels of fumonisin .
indeed , researchers at Iowa State University and the US Department of Agriculture have found that the level of fumonisin in the modified corn is reduced by as much as 80 % compared to conventional corn .
similarly , an Italian study of weaned piglets that were fed either conventional corn or the same variety modified to synthesize a bacterial protein that confers resistance to insect predation found that the modified variety contained lower levels of fumonisin .
more importantly , the piglets that consumed the modified corn achieved a greater final weight , a measure of overall health , despite no difference in feed intake between the two groups .
given the health benefits - to say nothing of the often higher and more reliable yields - governments should introduce incentives aimed at increasing use of such genetically engineered grains and other crops .
in addition , one would expect public @-@ health advocates to demand that such improved varieties be cultivated and used for food , not unlike requirements that drinking water be chlorinated and fluoridated .
and food producers that are committed to offering the safest and best products to their customers should be competing to get genetically engineered products into the marketplace .
alas , none of this has come to pass .
activists continue to mount vocal and tenacious opposition to genetically engineered foods , despite almost 20 years of demonstrated , significant benefits , including reduced use of chemical pesticides ( and thus less chemical runoff into waterways ) , greater use of farming practices that prevent soil erosion , higher profits for farmers , and less fungal contamination .
responding to the bleating of activists , policymakers have subjected the testing and commercialization of genetically engineered crops to unscientific and draconian regulations , with dire consequences .
a groundbreaking study of the political economy of agricultural biotechnology concluded that over @-@ regulation causes &quot; delays in the global diffusion of proven technologies , resulting in a lower rate of growth in the global food supply and higher food prices . &quot;
current policies also create &quot; disincentives for investing in further research and development , resulting in a slowdown in innovation of second @-@ generation technologies anticipated to introduce broad consumer and environmental benefits . &quot;
everyone involved in food production and consumption has suffered : consumers ( especially in developing countries ) have been subjected to avoidable health risks , and food producers have placed themselves in legal jeopardy for selling products known to have &quot; design defects . &quot;
public policy that discriminates against and discourages vital innovations in food production is not policy that has the public &apos;s interest at heart .
the World When the Fed raises Rates
Vienna - The United States Federal Reserve is the world &apos;s most powerful bank , and its most powerful component is the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) , the twelve men and women who meet eight times a year to determine - essentially by setting interest rates - the monetary policy of the world &apos;s largest economy .
the last time the Fed raised interest rates was in 2006 , before the growth @-@ sapping impact of the global financial crisis persuaded it and other central banks to lower rates effectively to zero and to employ so @-@ called quantitative easing ( QE ) to pump money into advanced economies .
but this year , for the first time since 2007 , every advanced economy in the world is growing - including America &apos;s .
and that means that the FOMC , fearful of asset bubbles , will at some point decide that America &apos;s interest rates must rise .
that may ( or may not , depending on the timing ) be good for the US economy , but what will it mean for the rest of the world ?
our research shows why the world , especially emerging countries , will be paying nervous attention .
in mid @-@ 2013 , when the Fed announced that it would gradually reduce its unconventional monetary @-@ policy measures ( for example , large @-@ scale purchases of mortgage @-@ backed securities ) , emerging markets suffered large capital outflows .
in other words , when the Fed even hints at tightening monetary policy , other countries suffer . depending on just how much the FOMC decides to tighten at a future meeting , we foresee negative effects on world GDP in the medium term , not only for emerging markets but also for industrialized economies .
since the Fed started to curb its QE program , there has been constant speculation over just when its current accommodative monetary policy will end .
market participants , be they lenders or borrowers , know that &quot; easy money &quot; has an expiry date .
they can see that after three large asset @-@ purchase programs , the Fed &apos;s balance sheet has more than quadrupled since 2007 , totaling about $ 4.5 trillion in February 2015 .
however , when assessing what the FOMC intends to do , it is important to bear in mind that the Fed &apos;s mandate is to advance America &apos;s national economic goals .
this means that it has to consider not just the desirable rate of inflation ( the target is a 2 % annual rate ) , but also the state of the labor market - and its judgment has global implications .
that is why the Fed &apos;s talk in mid @-@ 2013 about a gradual exit from unconventional monetary policy led to a so @-@ called &quot; taper tantrum &quot; among investors , triggering a surge in global volatility and a shift in market sentiment against emerging markets .
the question now is whether future changes by the FOMC in the federal funds rate ( the interest rate at which banks lend each other their overnight money deposited at the Fed ) will have similar , or indeed worse , effects .
to narrow any gap between its expectations for the economy and those of the public , the Fed publishes each FOMC member &apos;s view of the range of interest rates that should be expected over the next few years .
a member with a positive assessment of the US economy &apos;s growth prospects will expect a rise in the federal funds rate ; a pessimist will expect the rate to stay close to zero for a longer period .
using information released by the Fed in March , we have constructed two scenarios : &quot; lift @-@ off &quot; is based on the maximum projected interest rates , while &quot; delayed lift @-@ off &quot; is based on the minimum .
to see the impact beyond America on GDP , consumer prices , exchange rates , and interest rates , we then apply the scenarios to a total of 36 emerging and advanced economies that together account for 90 % of global output .
assuming a phased rise in the federal funds rate to 4 % by 2017 , we believe that economic growth in all regions except Latin America will slow in 2016 , and then slow even more in 2017 .
the cumulative loss in this &quot; lift @-@ off &quot; scenario is about ten times as large as any lost economic output under the &quot; delayed lift @-@ off &quot; alternative of only minimal changes to rates over the next couple of years .
our research shows that any monetary tightening by the Fed will affect the rest of the world , but to differing degrees .
those emerging markets that were hit severely during the &quot; taper tantrum &quot; episode - for example , Brazil , Indonesia , and Turkey - will certainly suffer .
but the greatest negative impact will be on countries such as Canada and Mexico , which have close trade links with the US economy or those , like Germany , Japan , and Singapore , that are deeply integrated into the global economy .
in other words , though emerging markets - through their dependence on capital inflows - will be at risk when America &apos;s monetary policy eventually returns to &quot; normal , &quot; the same will be true for advanced economies .
this commentary reflects the authors &quot; personal views , not those of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank or the Eurosystem .
ready for a US Rate Hike ?
Manila - The possibility that the US Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade sent jitters across emerging markets for weeks .
though the Fed has now decided to keep its policy rate ‎ unchanged , it also stated that a rate hike is still on the table for 2015 .
the concern is that countries that are dependent on foreign financing could be hit by sudden outflows of international capital , or that currency depreciation following the Fed hike could raise debt @-@ servicing costs for countries and businesses .
governments in the developing world would be wise to worry less about interest @-@ rate changes in the United States - which , in any case , they cannot control - and think more about policy changes they can make at home to strengthen their economies &quot; resilience .
an increase in US interest rates is not necessarily bad news for emerging countries .
many developing countries - especially in Asia - are in much better macroeconomic shape than they were just before the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s or at the onset of the 2008 global financial crisis .
and the Fed is likely to raise rates only if it judges US economic growth to be strong and sustainable , which would be a positive sign for the global economy in general .
furthermore , a delay in raising rates carries its own dangers , encouraging yield @-@ hungry investors to take larger risks - possibly necessitating a sharper or more abrupt change in interest rates in the future .
emerging countries can enhance their resilience to fluctuations in global interest rates by pursuing sound fiscal and monetary policies , continuing necessary structural reforms , and strengthening their financial systems .
in particular , recent research suggests four key policy areas in which governments should consider intervening .
for starters , countries should embrace policies that favor foreign direct investment ( FDI ) over inflows that can be withdrawn more quickly , such as foreign bank loans , debt , or equity investments .
my research with Hui Tong of the International Monetary Fund shows that countries whose capital inflows that are mainly in the form of FDI tend to be more resilient to foreign financial shocks .
when the global financial crisis erupted , countries with high FDI relative to total capital flows tended to experience a less severe liquidity crunch .
second , exchange rates need to reflect economic fundamentals .
but while theory suggests that flexible exchange rates should blunt foreign monetary or financial shocks , in practice , such a currency regime rarely works on its own .
indeed , my research with the Asian Development Bank &apos;s Xuehui Han has shown that when the US raises or lowers interest rates , most developing countries tend to follow suit , even when they have a flexible exchange rate .
the key reason is that they want to avoid large swings in the value of their currency .
appreciation can harm competitiveness , while depreciation increases the cost of servicing foreign @-@ currency debt , erodes market confidence , and leads to higher inflation .
the notable exceptions to this trend are countries that manage cross @-@ border capital flows , especially the corporate sector &apos;s exposure to foreign @-@ currency debt .
indeed , certain types of capital @-@ flow management - including limiting domestic debt denominated in foreign currency for both firms and households - have been shown to increase resilience .
third , domestic macroprudential and microprudential policies increase resilience .
these policies should aim at reducing or eliminating the wedge between activities that are good for individuals , banks , and firms , and those that benefit society as a whole .
one example of such a policy is to link banks &quot; mandatory reserve ratios to the speed at which credit is expanding or to the stage of the business cycle .
thus , during periods of expansion , when banks are eager to fund ever more risky borrowers , the reserve ratio rises , curbing potentially disruptive asset bubbles or overinvestment .
for those countries capable of designing and implementing prudential regulations , management of cross @-@ border capital flows becomes less useful and less desirable .
finally , it is no longer appropriate to judge whether a country &apos;s foreign @-@ currency reserves are adequate based on how many months of imports they can cover .
instead , the question to ask is whether the reserves can comfortably service the public and private sectors &quot; debt denominated in foreign currencies .
the US will normalize its interest rate policy sooner or later according to its need .
for other countries , it is important to focus on policies that can strengthen resilience to foreign financial or monetary shocks .
when the Yankees Go Home
Islamabad - Relations between the United States and Pakistan have continued to fray since a US Special Forces team killed Osama bin Laden in a comfortable villa near a major Pakistani military academy .
but the tit @-@ for @-@ tat retaliation that has followed the raid reflects deeper sources of mistrust and mutual suspicion .
the latest round has focused on the alleged activities of the Pakistani military &apos;s powerful intelligence agency , Inter @-@ Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , in the United States .
ISI is accused of watching over the Pakistani diaspora and of sponsoring unregistered lobbyists working to shape congressional opinion .
indeed , this is not the first time that Pakistan &apos;s relations with the US have been on a slippery slope .
in 1965 , after helping the country to build up its economy and its military strength , the US walked out over the war with India that Pakistan had provoked by sending &quot; freedom fighters &quot; into Kashmir .
in 1989 , following the Soviet Union &apos;s exit from Afghanistan , the US lost interest in what it now calls AfPak - Afghanistan @-@ Pakistan .
the Americans began returning to Pakistan until , in 1998 , the Pakistani government decided to follow India in testing an atomic bomb .
this led to the imposition of US sanctions - and America &apos;s third exit from Pakistan .
that situation remained unchanged when Afghanistan @-@ based Al Qaeda struck America on September 11 , 2001 .
after receiving a &quot; you are either with us or against us &quot; warning from President George W. Bush &apos;s administration , General Pervez Musharraf &apos;s Pakistan decided to side with the US .
it severed relations with Afghanistan &apos;s Taliban regime , which it had helped to install five years earlier , and allowed America to use its air space to launch strikes on Afghanistan .
for more than a decade , Pakistan and the US were close allies .
Pakistan let the US use its air bases to launch drone attacks on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan ; allowed its territory to be used as a supply route for NATO forces in landlocked Afghanistan ; and , less enthusiastically than the US wished , launched military operations against Taliban sanctuaries on the Pakistani side of the porous border with Afghanistan .
in return for its help , Pakistan received large doses of economic and military assistance .
according to the US Congress , Pakistan was provided $ 20 billion in aid between 2001 and 2011 .
in addition , Congress passed the Kerry @-@ Lugar bill , which promised $ 7.5 billion in economic aid from 2009 @-@ 2014 .
the US also encouraged the International Monetary Fund to give Pakistan emergency financial assistance equivalent to $ 11 billion , to be disbursed starting in late 2008 .
this cozy relationship created a &quot; moral hazard &quot; in Pakistan , as the generous flow of US aid insulated the government and military from any sense of urgency about economic reform : some foreign friend would always rescue the country from its perennial shortage of cash .
so far , that friend has been America , but the US could well pull out of Pakistan for the fourth time in the countries &quot; turbulent relationship - a threat that several influential figures in the US Congress have already made .
the dynamic that has brought Pakistan @-@ US relations to this point arguably began on December 1 , 2009 , when President Barack Obama , announcing a surge in the number of US troops in Afghanistan , also indicated his intention to start pulling back American troops beginning in July 2011 - a pledge that he reiterated two months ago .
this alerted Pakistan to the fact that , with the imminent departure of US troops , it would be left alone to fight the insurgency on both sides of its border with Afghanistan .
to do that , Pakistan would need help from some of the Afghan Pashtun tribes with which it had developed strong relations during the war against the Soviet Union .
the Jalaluddin Haqqani group , which was allowed to base itself in a sanctuary in Pakistan &apos;s North Waziristan tribal agency , was one such ally that Pakistan &apos;s government thought could be used to further its interests in Afghanistan .
but the Haqqanis were also the group that threatened the Americans the most .
the US pressed Pakistan to move against them . Pakistan resisted .
and , in the midst of this tussle , the US sent Navy Seals to find Bin Laden at a compound deep in Pakistani territory , informing Pakistan &apos;s government only after the raid was over .
Pakistan &apos;s embarrassed military pressed the government to begin distancing itself from the US .
after the identity of the CIA &apos;s station chief in Pakistan was exposed ( probably by Pakistani military officials ) , America made it known that it had good evidence that a prominent Pakistani journalist was ordered murdered by ISI .
this time around , the break between the US and Pakistan might not be easily repaired .
Pakistan has turned to China for economic and military help , clearly hoping for a less volatile relationship than the one that it has with America .
on one hand , Pakistan is seeking large investments from China to improve its physical infrastructure and exploit its considerable mineral wealth .
on the other hand , the Chinese have been invited to develop Gwadar port on the Balochistan coast , and to use it as a base for their fast @-@ expanding navy .
while China has not responded to these overtures with the degree of enthusiasm that accompanied them , the Chinese would be happy to fill the strategic vacuum likely to be created by America &apos;s accelerated departure from AfPak .
a major realignment of forces in the region is looming , and , with it , a new round of Asia &apos;s old Great Game .
when Women Lead
Munich - Would the world be more peaceful if women were in charge ?
a challenging new book by the Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker says that the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
in The Better Angels of Our Nature , Pinker presents data showing that human violence , while still very much with us today , has been gradually declining .
moreover , he says , &quot; over the long sweep of history , women have been and will be a pacifying force .
traditional war is a man &apos;s game : tribal women never band together to raid neighboring villages . &quot;
as mothers , women have evolutionary incentives to maintain peaceful conditions in which to nurture their offspring and ensure that their genes survive into the next generation .
skeptics immediately reply that women have not made war simply because they have rarely been in power .
if they were empowered as leaders , the conditions of an anarchic world would force them to make the same bellicose decisions that men do .
Margaret Thatcher , Golda Meir , and Indira Gandhi were powerful women ; all of them led their countries to war .
but it is also true that these women rose to leadership by playing according to the political rules of &quot; a man &apos;s world . &quot;
it was their success in conforming to male values that enabled their rise to leadership in the first place .
in a world in which women held a proportionate share ( one @-@ half ) of leadership positions , they might behave differently in power .
so we are left with the broader question : does gender really matter in leadership ?
in terms of stereotypes , various psychological studies show that men gravitate to the hard power of command , while women are collaborative and intuitively understand the soft power of attraction and persuasion .
Americans tend to describe leadership with tough male stereotypes , but recent leadership studies show increased success for what was once considered a &quot; feminine style . &quot;
in information @-@ based societies , networks are replacing hierarchies , and knowledge workers are less deferential .
management in a wide range of organizations is changing in the direction of &quot; shared leadership , &quot; and &quot; distributed leadership , &quot; with leaders in the center of a circle rather than atop a pyramid .
former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said that he had to &quot; coddle &quot; his employees .
even the military faces these changes .
in the United States , the Pentagon says that Army drillmasters do &quot; less shouting at everyone , &quot; because today &apos;s generation responds better to instructors who play &quot; a more counseling @-@ type role . &quot;
military success against terrorists and counterinsurgents requires soldiers to win hearts and minds , not just break buildings and bodies .
former US President George W. Bush once described his role as &quot; the decider , &quot; but there is much more to modern leadership than that .
modern leaders must be able to use networks , to collaborate , and to encourage participation .
women &apos;s non @-@ hierarchical style and relational skills fit a leadership need in the new world of knowledge @-@ based organizations and groups that men , on average , are less well prepared to meet .
in the past , when women fought their way to the top of organizations , they often had to adopt a &quot; masculine style , &quot; violating the broader social norm of female &quot; niceness . &quot;
now , however , with the information revolution and democratization demanding more participatory leadership , the &quot; feminine style &quot; is becoming a path to more effective leadership .
in order to lead successfully , men will not only have to value this style in their women colleagues , but will also have to master the same skills .
that is a trend , not ( yet ) a fact .
women still lag in leadership positions , holding only 5 % of top corporate positions and a minority of positions in elected legislatures ( just 16 % in the US , for example , compared to 45 % in Sweden ) .
one study of the 1,941 rulers of independent countries during the twentieth century found only 27 women , roughly half of whom came to power as widows or daughters of a male ruler .
less than 1 % of twentieth @-@ century rulers were women who gained power on their own .
so , given the new conventional wisdom in leadership studies that entering the information age means entering a woman &apos;s world , why are women not doing better ?
lack of experience , primary caregiver responsibilities , bargaining style , and plain old discrimination all help to explain the gender gap .
traditional career paths , and the cultural norms that constructed and reinforced them , simply have not enabled women to gain the skills required for top leadership positions in many organizational contexts .
research shows that even in democratic societies , women face a higher social risk than men when attempting to negotiate for career @-@ related resources such as compensation .
women are generally not well integrated into male networks that dominate organizations , and gender stereotypes still hamper women who try to overcome such barriers .
this bias is beginning to break down in information @-@ based societies , but it is a mistake to identify the new type of leadership we need in an information age simply as &quot; a woman &apos;s world . &quot;
even positive stereotypes are bad for women , men , and effective leadership .
leaders should be viewed less in terms of heroic command than as encouraging participation throughout an organization , group , country , or network .
questions of appropriate style - when to use hard and soft skills - are equally relevant for men and women , and should not be clouded by traditional gender stereotypes .
in some circumstances , men will need to act more &quot; like women &quot; ; in others , women will need to be more &quot; like men . &quot;
the key choices about war and peace in our future will depend not on gender , but on how leaders combine hard- and soft @-@ power skills to produce smart strategies .
both men and women will make those decisions .
but Pinker is probably correct when he notes that the parts of the world that lag in the decline of violence are also the parts that lag in the empowerment of women .
when Yes Means No
most commentators routinely assume that a Yes vote in the May 29 French referendum on the proposed European Union Constitution would be good for Europe and the EU .
but there is reason to doubt the conventional wisdom .
the French referendum will determine the political fate of French President Jacques Chirac - not France &apos;s commitment to Europe , which is fixed and immutable .
if the French vote No , M. Chirac is finished .
if they vote Yes , he is re @-@ empowered .
Europe clearly would be better off with Chirac weakened than strengthened , even if it means a temporary slowing of the pace of integration .
Chirac practices the politics of &quot; scapegoatism &quot; and excuses .
according to Chirac , France &apos;s exports are lagging not because France is losing its international competitiveness - although it is , especially to Germany - but because of the strong euro .
likewise , France &apos;s economic growth is waning not because France has failed to undertake necessary structural reforms , but because European interest rates are too high .
who does Chirac think is at fault ?
the European Central Bank , of course , for allowing the euro to appreciate too much and for not cutting interest rates enough .
unfortunately , this is typical of Chirac &apos;s leadership style : blame others , excuse yourself , and ignore reform .
this is hardly the type of leadership Europe needs to survive and prosper in the modern world .
but Europe will get more of it if the French vote Yes .
Europe also would continue to be dominated by the interests of the big countries , with the small countries in the back of the bus .
the fate of the Franco @-@ German axis , in particular , hinges on the outcome of the referendum .
a Yes invigorates the axis ; a No weakens it .
&quot; who would follow Chirac if the French vote No ? &quot; asked one EU ambassador in a recent interview .
&quot; even Berlin has options . &quot; but Berlin would not like a No vote .
if Chirac goes down , German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder loses face as well .
two birds would be wounded with one stone .
the prospect of a re @-@ energized Franco @-@ German axis is why the Dutch - who are traditionally pro @-@ European but do not want a Europe that marginalizes small countries - might vote No in their referendum ( which follows shortly upon France &apos;s ) if the French vote Yes .
a Dutch No would signal rejection of a corporatist Europe dominated by French and German interests , as well as representing a protest against the unpopular conservative and moralistic policies of the Balkenende government .
France is not the only EU country with an unpopular leader .
Eastern Europe also has a big stake in the outcome of the French referendum .
Chirac made it perfectly clear how he feels about the new smaller countries when he told them to &quot; shut up &quot; when they disagreed with him over Iraq .
more recently , Chirac &apos;s foreign minister , Michel Barnier , chastised the Romanian President Traian Barescu for lacking a &quot; European reflex , &quot; because Barescu plans to align Romania with Anglo @-@ Saxon liberal economic policies , and wants a special relationship with the US and UK to improve security in the Black Sea region .
rather than buckle to France &apos;s will , however , the Romanian president warned France &apos;s leaders to stop lecturing his country - a sure sign that French influence is on the wane even in countries with which it has had close historical ties .
a French No would sit well with the Union &apos;s newer members from Eastern Europe , who know Chirac is not their friend , and who are more attracted by promises of rapid economic growth than social protection and corporate state mischief .
finally , the referendum contains an unstated question about the future of European Monetary Union ( EMU ) and the euro .
the Yes camp argues that rejecting the Constitution would damage the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the euro .
but why would the EU fall into chaos and the euro wilt if the Treaty of Nice remains in force .
in the area of monetary integration , the European Constitution doesn &apos;t change anything , other than the voting procedures in the Governing Council if EMU grows beyond 15 member countries .
a Yes vote , on the other hand , would encourage a reassured Chirac to continue his policy of no reform and scapegoating the ECB .
external political pressure on the ECB and its president , Jean @-@ Claude Trichet , to lower interest rates and talk the euro down surely would increase .
this is more likely to bring the euro down than a No vote .
where are the Global Problem solvers ?
new YORK - One odd and disturbing aspect of global politics today is the confusion between negotiations and problem @-@ solving .
according to a timetable agreed in December 2007 , we have six months to reach a global agreement on climate change in Copenhagen .
governments are engaged in a massive negotiation , but they are not engaged in a massive effort at problem @-@ solving .
each country asks itself , &quot; How do I do the least and get the other countries to do the most ? , &quot; when they should be asking instead , &quot; How do we cooperate to achieve our shared goals at minimum cost and maximum benefit ? &quot;
these might sound like the same thing , but they are not .
addressing the problem of climate change requires reducing emissions of carbon dioxide from fossil fuels , which in turn involves choices in technology , some of which already exists and much of which needs to be developed .
for example , coal plants , if they are to remain a major part of the energy mix , will need to capture and store their CO2 , a process called &quot; carbon capture and sequestration , &quot; or CCS for short . yet this technology remains unproved .
similarly , we will need renewed public confidence in a new generation of nuclear power , with plants that are safe and reliably monitored .
we will need new technologies to mobilize large @-@ scale solar power , wind power , and geothermal power . we might try to tap bio @-@ fuels , but only in forms that do not compete with food supplies or with precious environmental assets .
the list goes on .
we will need improved energy efficiency , through &quot; green buildings &quot; and more efficient appliances . we will need to switch from cars with internal @-@ combustion engines to hybrids , plug @-@ in hybrids , battery @-@ powered , and fuel @-@ cell @-@ powered vehicles .
achieving a new generation of electric vehicles will require a decade of public and private partnership to achieve basic technological development ( such as improved batteries ) , a more robust electric grid , new infrastructure for re @-@ charging the automobiles , and much more .
similarly , it will take a decade of public and private investments to demonstrate the feasibility of coal @-@ fired plants that capture their carbon dioxide .
the switchover to new technologies is not mainly a matter of negotiation but of engineering , planning , financing , and incentives .
how can the world most effectively develop , demonstrate , and then spread these new technologies ?
where the benefits are unlikely to accrue to private investors , who should pay for the early demonstration models , which will require billions of dollars ?
how should we preserve private incentives for research and development while committing to transfer successful technologies to developing countries ?
these are pressing , unsolved questions .
yet the global negotiations on climate change are focusing on a different set of questions .
the negotiations are mainly about which groups of countries should cut their emissions , by how much , how fast , and relative to which baseline year .
countries are being pressed to cut emissions by 2020 by certain percentage targets , without much serious discussion about how the cuts can be achieved .
the answers depend , of course , on which low @-@ emission technologies will be available , and on how fast they can be deployed .
consider the United States . to cut emissions sharply , the US will need to switch over this decade to a new fleet of automobiles , powered increasingly by electricity .
the US will also have to decide on the renewal and expansion of its nuclear power plants , and on the use of public lands to build new renewable energy plants , especially using solar power .
and the US will need a new power grid to carry renewable energy from low @-@ density population sites - such as the southwestern deserts for solar power and the northern plains for wind power - to the high @-@ density populations of the coasts .
yet all of this requires a national plan , not simply a numerical target for emissions reduction .
similarly , China , like the US , can reduce CO2 emissions through increased energy efficiency and a new fleet of electric vehicles . but China must consider the question from the vantage point of a coal @-@ dependent economy .
China &apos;s future choices depend on whether &quot; clean coal &quot; can really work effectively and on a large scale . thus , China &apos;s emissions path depends crucially on early testing of the CCS technologies .
a true global brainstorming approach would first discuss the best technological and economic options available , and how to improve these options through targeted research and development and better economic incentives .
the negotiations would discuss the range of options open to each country and region - from CCS to solar , wind , and nuclear power - and would sketch a timetable for a new generation of low @-@ emission automobiles , recognizing that market competition as well as public financing will set the actual pace .
based on these building blocks , the world could agree on allocating the costs for speeding the development and spread of new low @-@ emission technologies .
this global framework would underpin national and global targets for emissions control and for monitoring the progress of the technological overhaul .
as new technologies are proven , the targets would become more stringent .
of course , part of the strategy would be to create market incentives for new low @-@ emission technologies , so that inventors could develop their own ideas with the prospect of large profits if those ideas are right .
my plea to discuss plans and strategies alongside specific emissions targets might seem to risk impeding the negotiations . but if we don &apos;t have a strategy to accompany our targets , the world &apos;s governments might not accept such targets in the first place , or might accept them cynically , without any intention of actually meeting them .
we need to think hard , and collaboratively , about the world &apos;s real technological options , and then pursue a common global framework that allows us to move into a new era , one based on feasible and sustainable technologies for energy , transport , industry , and buildings .
where Are the Syrian Peacemakers ?
Denver - Much has been said about the similarities between the chaos in Syria and the Balkan wars of the 1990 &quot; s .
but , while the prolonged killing may indeed be reminiscent , the political and diplomatic effort that finally ended the war in Bosnia is hardly in evidence today .
to date , there has been nothing similar to the Contact Group plan that was hammered out in the summer of 1994 by representatives from Britain , France , Germany , Russia , and the United States , and implemented the following year in Dayton , Ohio , after months of on @-@ the @-@ scene diplomacy .
in Syria , the only diplomatic process is in the hands of the courageous , if beleaguered , former United Nations Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan , who has understood - better than many analysts of this latest international outrage - that any lasting political settlement must not be a triumph of one side or the other .
no one can watch the ongoing violence in Syria without a sense of horror at the armed attacks on largely unarmed civilians , overwhelmingly by groups that support President Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime .
but those who say that Syria is on the brink of civil war miss what has become more obvious with each passing day : Syria alreadyis in a state of civil war , one whose battle lines were drawn months ago .
on one side is Assad &apos;s minority Alawite tribe , which over the years has attracted secular Sunnis to share in the spoils of a one @-@ party , authoritarian state .
but Assad &apos;s coalition is broader than that , which helps to explain how he has been able to hold on to power while other regimes in the region have not .
Syria &apos;s Christians , many of its 1.5 million Kurds , and even Damascus @-@ based , secular classes have been disinclined to join what is widely perceived in the country - though not by the rest of the world - as a sectarian Sunni opposition that might not be supportive of cultural pluralism were it to assume power .
in the past , characterizing as a civil war a conflict in a complex region was a tacit warning that others should stay out . but the civil war in Syria has much broader ramifications , which could lead to a wider regional conflict .
given this looming threat , it is becoming increasingly clear that staying out of the Syrian mess may not be an acceptable choice for countries that have an interest in a calmer and more democratic Middle East .
ominously , the conflict looks increasingly like a proxy war between Iran and the Sunni Arab states , which regard their own minority Shia populations as a potential Iranian fifth column .
Iran has sought to maintain its influence in the Levant ( including in Lebanon and among some Palestinian groups ) by providing material support to Assad .
by contrast , many Sunni Arab states have provided varying degrees of support to the largely Sunni opposition , a hodgepodge of groups that include the Muslim Brotherhood and other sectarian forces similar to Egypt &apos;s ultra @-@ conservative Salafis .
Russia and China , bruised by their loss of face in the NATO @-@ led intervention in Libya in 2011 , have sought to keep the international community out of Syria .
both countries fear that intervention - whether militarily or through economic sanctions - could harm their interests in Syria , where they - especially the Russians - have been the dominant external players .
in the absence of concerted international action , the US and Europe have largely weighed in with vocal condemnation of the party committing the overwhelming number of human @-@ rights violations : Assad and his henchmen . they have also highlighted the loss of life in an effort to shame Russia into adopting a more amenable position .
but denouncing Assad or Russia is unlikely to produce any effect except to assure domestic audiences that the West is on the side of the angels in the conflict .
likewise , proclaimed support for disparate , barely @-@ known rebel groups ; demands for dead @-@ on @-@ arrival sanctions resolutions ; feckless calls for Assad &apos;s departure ( as if he plans to take the advice ) ; and half @-@ baked ideas about enforced &quot; safe areas &quot; ( an utter failure in Bosnia ) are unlikely to spare many lives , much less bring about the endgame that is so desperately needed .
what is really needed are serious and sustained negotiations among interested international powers ( let &apos;s call them a &quot; contact group &quot; ) on a viable political outcome .
a &quot; Contact Group Plan &quot; should be carefully worked out with Annan and his team ( the only entity at this point that seems to have access to all sides ) .
most importantly , all of the plan &apos;s stakeholders then need to support Annan , publicly and privately .
publicly declaring support for Annan &apos;s ceasefire plan , and then whispering to journalists that it is &quot; in tatters , &quot; as has occurred repeatedly in recent weeks , will not get the job done .
clearly , a new way forward is needed , and a good start would be a political / diplomatic plan that Annan could sell to the parties .
in the Balkans , it was a US team that finally sold the Contact Group Plan to the parties directly involved .
we didn &apos;t succeed because we were geniuses . we succeeded because we had tremendous support from every country that wanted to see the horrific conflict in Bosnia brought to an end .
the same unqualified support is what Annan - the best diplomat we have out there - needs and deserves .
where Did Market Volatility Go ?
television and newspapers continue to trumpet every twist and turn of global financial markets .
in truth , however , the big story is the uneerie calm that has engulfed virtually every major asset class , from stocks to bonds .
is the whole investment world on Prozac ?
conspiracy theories abound , particularly among the ranks of financial traders , for whom volatility is like wind to a sailor .
these traders confidently figure that as long as markets gyrate , no matter what the direction , they can always make money .
and , thanks to the rest of us who don &apos;t have the time , information , and skill to match wits with them , they are mostly right .
but , with today &apos;s dormant markets , the pickings are slim .
the favored Bogeymen of the day are giant government investors , particularly Asian central banks , with their trillions of dollars in assets .
these superfunds , whose managers do not necessarily share the same passion for profit as private investors , are said to be squeezing the life out of interest rates and exchange rates .
&quot; the big Asian central banks are oppressing us , &quot; one young trader recently complained to me .
what a difference a decade makes .
during the 1990 &quot; s , private investors looked at big , lumbering central banks as cash cows , long on money and short on financial acumen .
George Soros once made a billion dollars off the Bank of England in just an hour .
his basic strategy was a standard one : bet against any central bank that tries to defend an inconsistent macroeconomic policy .
traders did not win every battle , of course .
it was the speculators whose blood flowed in the streets when they attacked Hong Kong &apos;s dollar peg in 1998 .
but overall , betting against big government financial institutions proved to be a richly rewarding business .
that was the 1990 &quot; s .
today , many traders see formerly inept state giants as financial geniuses , capable of taming complex financial formulas and exploiting their superior size and trading information to squeeze the life out of currency and interest rate markets .
these behemoths &quot; innate conservatism , having calmed bond and currency markets , is now having a similar effect on stocks .
although few accuse Asian central banks of explicitly conspiring to calm global markets , some say that their common cautious approach to trading is a form of implicit collusion .
as much as we may sympathize with young would @-@ be millionaire traders , does their story of oppression make any sense ?
could it be true that huge government investors from Asia ( not to mention Russia , Latin America , and the Middle East ) have quietly taken control of world markets ?
perhaps , but the bogeyman theory seems a bit overblown .
yes , the big Asian central banks do sit on almost $ 3 trillion in assets ; China &apos;s central bank alone has around a trillion dollars .
this gives them a capital base similar to the combined assets of all the world &apos;s major hedge funds .
but this metric is very deceptive .
hedge funds constitute only a small percentage of overall world financial markets , which , according to a recent study by the McKinnsey Global Institute , now exceed $ 120 trillion .
and hedge funds , unlike banks , can leverage their bets , borrowing to take on assets many times the size of their capital base .
otherwise , George Soros and his wealthy fellow investors could not have dreamed of taking on the Bank of England .
in fact , the explanation for market calm probably lies elsewhere .
so , if a conspiracy of Asian central banks is not to blame for the volatility drought that is parching traders &quot; earnings , what is ?
surely , today &apos;s low volatility is partly cyclical .
stock market volatility was also very low during the early 1990 &quot; s , before reaching new peaks later in the decade .
moreover , financial innovation and globalization allow markets to spread risk more effectively than ever before , placing it in the hands of those who can best manage it .
improved central bank policy is another huge factor .
in the early 1990 &quot; s , the average level of world inflation exceeded 30 % ; now it is less than 4 % .
all of these changes have in turn contributed to lower economy @-@ wide output and consumption volatility in both rich and developing countries .
they have also contributed mightily to the high general level of asset prices , helping create the vast riches of which today &apos;s hungry young traders are so jealous .
so will today &apos;s relative market calm continue ?
unfortunately , no .
today &apos;s brave new world of financial globalization will almost surely face severe new stress tests , reminding us that recessions still happen .
frankly , although I do not see the five @-@ year @-@ old global expansion coming to an end yet , there is no question that risks are on the rise , with output in the United States having slowed sharply in the third quarter , and central banks &quot; hands tied by inflation risks . further ahead , it is not hard to imagine geopolitical instability - possibly emanating from Iran , Iraq , or North Korea - unsettling markets .
whatever the scenario that ends the calm , today &apos;s age of low volatility will seem like a distant dream to most of us - and a forgotten nightmare for ambitious financial traders .
which New Middle East ?
Berlin - regardless of whether democratization in the &quot; new Middle East &quot; succeeds or authoritarian forms of government prevail once again , one fundamental change has already become clear : no one will be able to govern without taking into account domestic public opinion .
this change will shift the foreign @-@ policy parameters of the Middle East conflict ( understood as both an Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict and as a conflict between Israelis and Arabs more generally ) .
despite wars in Lebanon and Gaza , and the intifadas in the occupied West Bank , these parameters have proven surprisingly stable for decades , anchored by the peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan and the Oslo accords with the Palestinians .
all this is about to change .
and , while the tectonic shift in the region was triggered by the &quot; Arab Awakening , &quot; its players are not limited to the Arab world or to the confines of the Middle East conflict .
the United States , Europe , Turkey , and , in a certain sense , Iran all play a role - some more directly than others .
let &apos;s begin with the US .
President Barack Obama &apos;s speech in Cairo two years ago created great expectations , but few or none have been fulfilled .
instead , the US allowed a political vacuum to form in the absence of any movement on the part of Israel &apos;s government . this vacuum has now been filled by the Arab Awakening .
Europe , meanwhile , is preoccupied with its own crisis .
but , in the last few years , the Europeans , led by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy , have de facto slammed the door to European Union accession in Turkey &apos;s face .
as a result , Turkey has embraced a &quot; neo @-@ Ottoman &quot; foreign policy , in which the Arab world - even more than the Caucasus , Central Asia , and the Balkans - plays the central role .
of course , Turkey , in accordance with its political , security , and economic interests , has no choice but to pay close attention to its southern neighborhood , and must try to prevent chaotic developments there .
Turkey would be facing the same risks even if it were integrated into a European context , but its priorities would then be completely different .
because of Europe &apos;s short @-@ sightedness , Turkey has in effect abandoned its ambitions for EU membership and opted for the neo @-@ Ottoman project of becoming a Middle Eastern power - a policy shift that reflects both interests and ideology .
on the one hand , Turkey views regional dominance as a stepping @-@ stone to a greater global role ; on the other hand , it views itself as a role model for successful modernization of the Middle East on an Islamic @-@ democratic basis .
this bid for regional preeminence will sooner or later bring Turkey into serious conflict with neighboring Iran .
if Turkey prevails , Iran and the radicals in the region will be caught on the losing side of history - and they know it .
while Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan &apos;s government is trying to maintain good relations with Iran , its ambition to become the leading Sunni power means that Turkey must sooner or later contest Iran &apos;s influence in Iraq , as well as in Syria and Palestine . and that means conflict .
the drastic deterioration in Turkey &apos;s relations with Israel is related to this emerging Iranian @-@ Turkish rivalry .
to be sure , this rivalry also has a positive side from the Israeli point of view - the weakening of Iran and other regional radicals .
but , for Turkey as an aspiring regional leader , the interests of the Palestinians are naturally more important than its relations with Israel .
this has become all the more true in light of the revolutionary changes in the Arab world , and is at the root of Erdoğan &apos;s foreign @-@ policy reorientation .
as a result , Israel is in an increasingly difficult situation .
without a strategic re @-@ orientation of its own - to remain passive is a risky endeavor in a rapidly changing world order - Israel would further delegitimize and isolate itself internationally .
a viable Israeli answer to the dramatic changes in the region - and to their already foreseeable consequences - can only take the form of a serious offer of negotiations to Mahmoud Abbas &apos;s Palestinian government , with the objective of signing a comprehensive peace treaty .
security questions must be taken seriously , but they carry less and less weight , because a sufficiently long period can be left between the treaty &apos;s conclusion and its full implementation to resolve them by mutual agreement .
but Israel &apos;s current passivity - with all of its negative long @-@ term consequences for the country - is likely to continue as long as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu considers his coalition &apos;s survival more important than a decisive peace initiative .
at the same time , the pressure of the Arab revolutions is transforming the Palestinians into a dynamic political factor .
for example , in view of the looming fall of Syria &apos;s President Bashar al @-@ Assad , the pressure of the Egyptian revolution , and the new role of Islamism in the region , Hamas &apos;s alliance with Iran is becoming increasingly problematic .
it remains to be seen whether , in the end , the &quot; Turkish course &quot; will prevail against the radicals in Gaza or not .
in any case , Hamas faces some risky and consequential decisions of its own - all the more so should its main rival , Abbas &apos;s Palestinian Authority , succeed in its current diplomatic campaign at the United Nations .
Obama had promised a Palestinian state within one year , and Abbas is now building upon that promise .
but what happens next is crucial .
will Abbas be able to keep the Palestinians on a diplomatic path , or will the situation degenerate again into violence and another disaster ?
and what will the Palestinian road towards peace look like after the UN decision to recognize some form of statehood for Palestine ?
given the current pace of change in the Middle East , we might not have to wait long for answers - or for more questions .
which Turkey in What Europe ?
&quot; a tempest in a teapot &quot; is perhaps the best description of the recent squabbles about opening the European Union &apos;s accession negotiations with Turkey .
the election in Germany was in part fought on the issue , as Chancellor Angela Merkel ran on a platform of offering Turkey a &quot; privileged partnership , &quot; rather than full admission .
the Austrian government &apos;s posturing - motivated as much by its upcoming elections as genuine foreign policy concerns - seemed to threaten the opening of the accession talks themselves .
but German foreign policy has always been marked by continuity , and the new foreign minister , Frank @-@ Walter Steinmeier , the chief of staff under former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder , has repeatedly advocated full membership for Turkey .
it is thus unlikely that the Grand Coalition will adopt a different political approach towards Turkey than the previous Red @-@ Green government .
after a bit of drama , Austria also gave up its opposition to the accession talks , in exchange for a promise of admission for Croatia , and the intra @-@ European squabbles have been patched up .
so the British , under Tony Blair &apos;s current presidency of the EU Council of Ministers , have gotten their way for now , and the Americans - keen backers of Turkey &apos;s EU aspirations - have once again succeeded in acting as a &quot; European power . &quot;
accession negotiations with Turkey are now a fact .
but much of the debate about Turkey &apos;s possible accession has been focused on the wrong issues : whether Turkey is culturally &quot; in line &quot; with Europe or whether Europe is in some sense &quot; Christian &quot; and could assimilate 100 million Muslims .
the real issue - not disputed even by most Turks - is that Turkey is neither economically ready nor , above all , a mature enough democracy for full EU membership .
and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , Turkey &apos;s prime minister , can place his trust in the near automatic mechanisms that characterize the EU &apos;s instDespite substantial progress , democratization is only a torso .
human and civil rights still do not meet Western European standards , religious and ethnic minorities are recognized only on paper , acknowledgment of the historic genocide of the Armenians is given mere lip service , and civilian control over the military remains weak .
raising this long list of shortcomings puts Western critics in an uncomfortable position with their pro @-@ European Turkish interlocutors .
Turkey &apos;s pro @-@ Western forces find just as much fault with their country &apos;s political system as the European critics , but they expect the prospect of EU membership to accelerate the progress of reforms .
nationalist Turks , on the other hand , regard joining the EU mainly as a confirmation of national power and view all criticism of the country as a violation of Turks &quot; collective honor .
had the start of accession negotiations been postponed or canceled , Turkey &apos;s pro @-@ Europeans would have suffered from a nationalist backlash .
even now , Turkey &apos;s unrequited love for Europe can still fade into aversion , with Islamic fundamentalism and Greater Turkey nationalism continuing to represent other , eastward @-@ leaning options .
advocates of a conditioned accession are thus under extraordinary pressure to be nice , even as Turkish officials stage provocations , like the recent suit against the noted author Orhan Pamuk for &quot; public denigration of Turkish identity &quot; because he dared to question the official position on the Armenian genocide .
as a result , a general lack of clarity about what kind of Turkey should be accepted characterizes the accession debate , which focuses - much as in the recent referenda on the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands - on rather meaningless generalities .
but , more importantly , the lack of clarity on the Turkish accession question reflects Europe &apos;s ambivalence regarding its image of itself .
to be sure , Turkey shows substantial political and cultural differences , especially when it comes to the importance of civil society , sexual equality , and the role of religion in public life .
but the real question is this : what kind of Europe do Europeans themselves want ?
&quot; deepening &quot; and &quot; widening &quot; European integration are the superficial opposites here .
Austria does not want any more members - with the inconsistent exception of Croatia - but wants to deepen the EU &apos;s political and cultural unity .
many &quot; old &quot; Europeans , including Germany after Schröder &apos;s resignation and France under a weakened Jacques Chirac , share that stance .
Britain , the leading nation of &quot; new &quot; Europe , has no desire for an EU constitution , more executive and parliamentary power in Brussels , a stronger European Parliament , or the euro .
like many new members , Britain prefers a loosely connected Europe of different nations - essentially a free @-@ trade zone , but with open borders at its periphery - with sufficient strategic coordination to constitute a quasi @-@ empire in geopolitical terms , on a par with the United States .
the fundamental difference is that a loosely tied Union is attractive to all sorts of aspirants , including Georgia , Ukraine , and other Soviet successor states - and perhaps even North African countries like Morocco - while a &quot; deepened &quot; Europe , with a clear political identity , high social @-@ welfare entitlements , and growing cultural homogeneity , would naturally set itself apart and not be particularly attractive to these countries .
paradoxically , then , what the British , with their opposition to &quot; deepening &quot; European integration , are really offering the Turks is precisely the sort of &quot; privileged partnership &quot; that Austria , together with Angela Merkel , has been backing .
both positions reject the idea of making Turkey really &quot; European . &quot;
the structure that Britain seems to have in mind is , according to some , reminiscent of the loose alliance binding the British Commonwealth .
but &quot; History &apos;s ruse &quot; could be that even as the British succeed in improving Turkey &apos;s prospects for admission , the renegotiation of the Nice treaty , which will become necessary if Croatia is admitted , is likely to lead to stronger European integration .
thus , what we may get is both deepening and widening of the EU - something that today seems like squaring the circle .
which Way is West for Turkey ?
when Turkey &apos;s parliament voted in March 2003 against allowing American troops to open a northern front against Iraq , Turkey &apos;s traditional strategic partnership with the United States ended .
the two countries still recognize many mutual interests , but now they manage these interests on a far different basis .
the vote shocked &quot; old Europe &quot; and the Arab world as much as the Bush administration .
Europeans who considered Turkey a potential Trojan horse for America within the European Union were forced to reconsider .
for many Arabs , the vote showed that Turkey was not an American lackey and would not cooperate with American imperial designs , despite close Turkish @-@ Israeli relations .
long @-@ simmering disagreements between Turkey and the US came to a boil with the emergence of the Kurds of northern Iraq as the Pentagon &apos;s main allies in the Iraq War .
the American administration made it clear that military intervention by Turkey in Northern Iraq would not be tolerated .
that message was confirmed on July 4 , 2003 , when American forces arrested several Turkish Special Forces troops in the town of Sulaimaniya , humiliating them by putting sacks over their head as they took them into custody .
only intervention by US Vice President Dick Cheney two and a half days later secured the release of the soldiers , who were alleged to have been planning clandestine operations within the Kurdish zone .
despite ongoing tensions , the Turkish government has been eager to mend relations with America , as it is anxious to have some influence over developments in Iraq .
so the authorities responded quickly to the Bush administration &apos;s request for Turkish troops to join the coalition , although the idea was stillborn - rejected by both the Kurds and the American @-@ appointed Governing Council in Iraq .
America has its own reasons to patch up the relationship .
Turkey &apos;s secular , capitalistic , democratic order has become especially valuable to the Bush administration as it seeks to integrate the wider Middle East into the world system by liberalizing its economy and democratizing its polity .
thus , America trumpeted its continuing support for Turkish membership in the EU , notably in President Bush &apos;s speech in June at Istanbul &apos;s Galatasaray University - at a bridge that joins Asia and Europe .
but serious bilateral problems remain .
the government is irritated by US occupation forces &apos; neglect of the northern Iraqi bases of the PKK , the Kurdish separatist insurgents who have fought a 15 @-@ year war against Turkey .
more broadly , the government regards the US as too complacent vis @-@ à @-@ vis Kurdish political developments and unmoved by Turkey &apos;s concerns about Kurdish independence .
the US , for its part , is unhappy with the government &apos;s objections to unrestricted American use of the Incirlik airbase in southeastern Turkey , as well as by recent tensions with Israel .
in the meantime , Turkey is moving closer to the EU , with the government overcoming nationalistic objections in the Parliament to push through comprehensive reforms .
Turkey also showed its good will over Cyprus , removing a nagging political obstacle to EU membership .
these steps led to the European Commission &apos;s recent recommendation to begin accession negotiations with Turkey .
the EU accession process has also underpinned a shift in Turkish policy on Iraq .
previously , Turkey viewed Iraq solely in the context of its domestic Kurdish problem .
but widespread European opposition to the war removed the possibility of Turkish military intervention , forcing the government to develop another vision of Turkey &apos;s interests .
at the same time , the Iraqi Kurds also appear to appreciate how much they need a friendly Turkey .
the northern border with Turkey is their lifeline to the outside world .
as a result , Turkey no longer considers a federalized Iraq a threat to its security , as long as each federal unit maintains a measure of ethnic diversity .
of course , Turkey remains opposed to an independent Kurdistan . but now its concern is more closely tied to regional politics than to the Kurdish issue .
Turkey has no desire to serve as a strategic counterweight to Iran and believes that only a territorially intact Iraq can continue to play that role .
furthermore , Turkey is concerned about the possibility of civil war in Kurdistan between the two largest Kurdish factions .
but , unlike either Iran or Syria , Turkey genuinely wishes to see a strong and representative government in Baghdad .
thanks to EU pressures , Turkey &apos;s domestic Kurdish problem is well on the way to being resolved democratically , with most Kurdish leaders in Turkey expressing their commitment to Turkish unity .
for Turkey to consider military intervention in Kurdistan , EU member states would first have to renege on their commitment to negotiate Turkish accession .
equally dramatic would be any attempt by the Kurds to forcibly change the demographic balance of the multiethnic city of Kirkuk .
Turkey would prefer that Kirkuk , with its large Turkmen population , be given special status in the forthcoming draft Iraqi constitution .
the US also shows signs of understanding the importance of maintaining a multiethnic Kirkuk and is putting pressure on its Kurdish allies .
Turkish diplomacy has thus become a well @-@ calibrated balancing act , moving closer to European positions in the Middle East , but eager to maintain close relations with the US .
if this approach succeeds , Europe &apos;s bridge to Asia may also become its bridge to America .
White House Sex Crimes
new YORK - Sex crime has a telltale signature , even when those directing the outrages are some of the most powerful men and women in the United States .
how extraordinary , then , to learn that one of the perpetrators of these crimes , Condoleezza Rice , has just led the debate in a special session of the United Nations Security Council on the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war .
I had a sense of déjà vu when I saw the photos that emerged in 2004 from Abu Ghraib prison .
even as the Bush administration was spinning the notion that the torture of prisoners was the work of &quot; a few bad apples &quot; low in the military hierarchy , I knew that we were seeing evidence of a systemic policy set at the top .
it &apos;s not that I am a genius . it &apos;s simply that , having worked at a rape crisis center and been trained in the basics of sex crime , I have learned that all sex predators go about things in certain recognizable ways .
we now know that the torture of prisoners was the result of a policy set in the White House by former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , Vice President Dick Cheney , and Rice - who actually chaired the torture meetings .
the Pentagon has also acknowledged that it had authorized sexualized abuse of detainees as part of interrogation practices to be performed by female operatives .
and documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union have Rumsfeld , in his own words , &quot; checking in &quot; on the sexualized humiliation of prisoners .
the sexualization of torture from the top basically turned Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo Bay into an organized sex @-@ crime ring in which the trafficked sex slaves were US @-@ held prisoners .
looking at the classic S and M nature of some of this torture , it is hard not to speculate that someone setting policy was aroused by all of this .
the nonsexual torture that was committed ranged from beatings and suffocation , electrodes attached to genitals , and forced sleep deprivation , to prisoners being hung by the wrists from the ceiling and placed in solitary confinement until psychosis was induced .
these abuses violate both US and international law .
three former military attorneys , recognizing this blunt truth , refused to participate in the &quot; military tribunals &quot; - rather , &quot; show trials &quot; - aimed at condemning men whose confessions were elicited through torture .
though we can now debate what the penalty for water @-@ boarding should be , America as a nation , maintaining an odd silence , still cannot seem to discuss the sexual crimes involved .
why ?
it &apos;s not as if the sex crimes that US leaders either authorized or tolerated are not staring Americans in the face : the images of male prisoners with their heads hooded with women &apos;s underwear ; the documented reports of female US soldiers deployed to smear menstrual blood on the faces of male prisoners , and of military interrogators or contractors forcing prisoners to simulate sex with each other , to penetrate themselves with objects , or to submit to being penetrated by objects .
indeed , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 was written deliberately with loopholes that gave immunity to perpetrators of many kinds of sexual humiliation and abuse .
there is also the testimony by female soldiers such as Lynndie England about compelling male prisoners to masturbate , as well as an FBI memo objecting to a policy of &quot; highly aggressive interrogation techniques . &quot;
the memo cites a female interrogator rubbing lotion on a shackled detainee and whispering in his ear - during Ramadan when sexual contact with a strange woman would be most offensive - then suddenly bending back his thumbs until he grimaced in pain , and violently grabbing his genitals .
sexual abuse in US @-@ operated prisons got worse and worse over time , ultimately including , according to doctors who examined detainees , anal sodomy .
all this may sound bizarre if you are a normal person , but it is standard operating procedure for sex offenders .
those who work in the field know that once sex abusers control a powerless victim , they will invariably push the boundaries with ever more extreme behavior .
abusers start by undressing their victims , but once that line has been breached , you are likely to hear from the victim about oral and anal penetration , greater and greater pain and fear being inflicted , and more and more carelessness about exposing the crimes as the perpetrator &apos;s inhibitions fall away .
the perpetrator is also likely to engage in ever @-@ escalating rationalizations , often arguing that the offenses serve a greater good .
finally , the victim is blamed for the abuse : in the case of the detainees , if they would only &quot; behave , &quot; and confess , they wouldn &apos;t bring all this on themselves .
silence , and even collusion , is also typical of sex crimes within a family .
Americans are behaving like a dysfunctional family by shielding sex criminals in their midst through silence .
just as sex criminals - and the leaders who directed the use of rape and sexual abuse as a military strategy - were tried and sentenced after the wars in Bosnia and Sierra Leone , so Americans must hold accountable those who committed , or authorized , sex crimes in US @-@ operated prisons .
throughout the world , this perverse and graphic criminality has added fuel to anxiety about US cultural and military power .
these acts need to be called by their true names - war crimes and sex crimes - and people in America need to demand justice for the perpetrators and their victims .
as in a family , only when people start to speak out and tell the truth about rape and sexual assault can the healing begin .
Whither Africa &apos;s &quot; Frontier Markets &quot; ?
new YORK - Zimbabwe &apos;s election appears , once again , to confirm a truism : Africa only seems to make international headlines when disasters strike - a drought , a coup , a war , a genocide , or , as in the case of Robert Mugabe , grossly incompetent government .
but , over the past several years , a number of sub @-@ Saharan countries have attracted unprecedented inflows of foreign capital .
recent global financial turmoil has only added to Africa &apos;s allure , because its frontier markets are less vulnerable to international volatility than are most of the world &apos;s more familiar emerging economies .
there are three main reasons why many sub @-@ Saharan countries are performing well .
first , high commodity prices yield windfall profits for the region &apos;s leading producers of raw materials .
growing demand for energy , metals , and minerals - particularly in China - has driven unprecedented levels of foreign investment .
even large pension funds are beginning to take notice .
moreover , a large number of Africa &apos;s poorest countries have benefited from exponential growth in ( primarily United States @-@ based ) philanthropy .
but , while both of these positive trends are likely to continue , a third positive factor may not prove as durable .
every year , Africans living outside the continent send roughly $ 30 billion to family and friends back home .
these remittances are vitally important for economic stability in several African countries . an economic slowdown in the US and Europe could substantially slow this infusion of cash , because immigrants are often the first to lose their jobs when recession fears take hold .
at the same time , though Africa &apos;s frontier economies are less vulnerable than other emerging markets to global financial turbulence , they are highly vulnerable to political turmoil closer to home .
the three countries that served as pillars of regional stability for the past several years - Nigeria , Kenya , and South Africa - are now too pre @-@ occupied with political troubles of their own to provide the peacekeepers , reconstruction funds , and political pressure that often limit the damage from conflicts elsewhere in the region .
most of Nigeria &apos;s problems are well known .
militants in the oil @-@ rich Niger Delta region have at times shut down as much as 30 % of the country &apos;s oil exports , a vital source of state revenue .
President Umaru Yar &apos;Adua has taken concrete steps to tackle elite @-@ level corruption in Nigeria , and appears to have made progress toward a comprehensive peace agreement with the Delta rebels .
but Yar &apos;Adua might soon confront a big short @-@ term problem .
the country &apos;s National Election Tribunal , having overturned the outcomes of several provincial elections , may well annul the results of last year &apos;s presidential race , forcing him to run for president all over again .
while Yar &apos;Adua could use the goodwill that he has built up over the past year to win by an even larger margin , the 90 @-@ day election campaign would almost certainly trigger civil unrest , and Nigeria &apos;s leadership would be too busy navigating domestic political rivalries to help stabilize conflicts elsewhere in Africa .
Kenya &apos;s troubles run deeper .
solid economic expansion and one of the world &apos;s fastest @-@ growing stock markets have not helped the country avert a deepening political crisis and mounting ethnic violence since disputed presidential election results in December .
President Mwai Kibaki , whom international observers accuse of rigging the vote , has hinted at a plan to share power in a unity government , but opposition leader Raila Odinga has heard these promises before .
Odinga worked hard to help elect Kibaki in 2002 , only to see Kibaki renege on a similar pledge .
despite the alarming escalation in violence , fears of civil war in Kenya are probably exaggerated .
the country &apos;s Orange opposition movement has recently won key posts in parliament and , for the moment , is heeding calls for calm from former United nations Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan and representatives of the African Union .
but no one should expect Kenya to play a stabilizing regional role again anytime soon .
the continent &apos;s third pillar , South Africa , will spend 2008 mired in an escalating political feud between Thabo Mbeki , the lame @-@ duck president , and Jacob Zuma , a former deputy who is the newly elected leader of the ruling African National Congress and the leading candidate to succeed Mbeki , his bitter rival , next year .
South Africa &apos;s courts have become a political battleground , as Mbeki and his allies use corruption charges to try to cripple Zuma &apos;s candidacy .
the resulting political firestorm may well force Zuma to rely on core support from key allies within the country &apos;s trade union movement and Communist Party , challenging the political elite &apos;s pro @-@ market consensus and provoking debate over the future of South Africa &apos;s economic policy .
no countries in sub @-@ Saharan Africa will have the economic heft and political self @-@ confidence to replace Nigeria , Kenya , and South Africa as pillars of stability anytime soon .
regional blocs like the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , the Southern African Customs Union ( SACU ) , and the East African Community ( EAC ) will eventually assume larger roles in helping resolve the continent &apos;s most intractable diplomatic and economic problems .
but that won &apos;t happen this year .
there remain many good reasons for investors to take a chance on Africa &apos;s frontier markets .
but it will not necessarily take a drought , a coup , a war , or a genocide to make them think twice .
Whither Europe ?
Beijing - With the likelihood of a contagious sovereign @-@ debt implosion and European bank failures greatly reduced by the Greek debt deal and the European Central Bank &apos;s lending program , it is time to look ahead .
where do the European Union , the eurozone , and the EU &apos;s highly indebted countries go from here ?
will Europe be able to roll back its welfare states &quot; biggest excesses without economic distress and social unrest toppling governments and , in the peripheral countries , undermining already @-@ tenuous agreements with creditors ?
some good news globally will have an impact on how these questions are resolved .
the United States &quot; economy is gradually reviving , albeit slowly by the standards of recovery from a deep recession .
China , Brazil , and India have not decoupled from their customers in Europe and North America , and so are slowing , though a relatively soft landing is likely if Europe &apos;s recession is as short and mild as predicted .
the EU &apos;s economic output and population are larger than that of the US , so the fate of the 27 EU countries is everyone &apos;s business , from New York to New Delhi , São Paulo to Shanghai .
formed originally as a free @-@ trade area , the eurozone comprises 17 of the countries .
knitting together 17 disparate economies , cultures , and institutions was a monumental undertaking , fraught with risk .
the Lisbon Treaty emphasizes unanimity in decision @-@ making .
with some members inside of the eurozone , and others remaining outside of it , and with disparate economic interests and monetary and fiscal traditions even within the eurozone , agreement is difficult .
that sets the stage for three broad scenarios , each with implications for the European and global economy , the financial and banking system , and relations between the member states and EU institutions .
in the first scenario , a more united and homogeneous Europe emerges from the crisis , enforcing greater restrictions on member states &quot; budgets to reduce apparent risk .
accompanied by a strong , broad eurozone , risk of a future currency crisis remains .
in the second scenario , a two- or three @-@ tiered Europe includes a two @-@ tiered euro , with the weaker countries using a separate &quot; euro @-@ B &quot; currency that can float against the stronger economies &quot; &quot; euro @-@ A. &quot;
this arrangement would hold out the promise to fiscally stressed economies that , if they get their act together , they could rejoin euro @-@ A - and do so more readily than they could from their own currency .
in the final scenario , what emerges is a more decentralized Europe , with less top @-@ down agreement in areas beyond trade and a smaller , more homogeneous eurozone composed of the EU &apos;s core economies .
such a construct would be far more popular with citizens who are unhappy with the accretion of EU power in Brussels and the loss of traditional sovereignty .
some current euro members - Greece ( and perhaps others ) - would revert to national currencies .
none of these options is easy ; each entails serious difficulties and great risks .
episodic muddling through may be the best that can be hoped for .
for example , how would Greece ( or any country ) exit the euro in order to cushion the extreme downward wage adjustment required to regain competitiveness , and to avoid the severe social unrest that could result from reining in debt too rapidly ?
as soon as word got out that Greece was seriously considering such a move - well before it could even generate a new drachma currency - euro bank deposits would flee Greece .
as a result , Greece would be forced to impose capital controls .
some contracts denominated in euros would be subject to Greek law , some to European law , and others - for example , derivatives contracts - to British or US law .
legal chaos would result .
yet sticking to the euro and forcing all of the adjustments in wages risks greater unrest ; indeed , it might merely postpone the inevitable .
governments and the bond market will test the seriousness of the newly agreed fiscal guidelines ( if they are ratified ) .
while talk is tough now , the history of such agreements does not inspire optimism .
before the financial crisis , even Germany violated the EU Stability and Growth Pact &apos;s ( SGP ) deficit limits .
in the US , the 1980 &quot; s deficit limits set by the Gramm @-@ Rudman @-@ Hollings law were not met , and , like the SGP , were revised and extended .
agreements with , and access to , the International Monetary Fund and Europe &apos;s new bailout fund provide ( soft ) constraints .
regardless of how these governance and fiscal issues are resolved , or muddled through , Europe &apos;s banks remain a thorny issue .
with the time afforded by the ECB &apos;s three @-@ year cheap loans , they have some breathing room to rebuild their capital and clean up their balance sheets .
but , while doing so , they are not likely to be expanding private @-@ sector lending to support economic growth .
European banks are far more thinly capitalized , and account for a much larger share of credit extended , than banks in the US , where much more lending originates in capital markets .
most large US banks - Citi is an exception - passed US Federal Reserve stress tests recently , with enough capital to withstand a hypothetical deep recession ( 13 % unemployment , a 21 % further fall in home prices , and a 50 % stock @-@ market decline ) .
Europe &apos;s stress tests have been much weaker .
some sort of Brady bond to reduce and extend excessive sovereign debt will be necessary .
we can expect further European turmoil - from banks , sovereign debt , and social unrest in response to even modest welfare @-@ state rollbacks - and clashing visions , within and among countries , concerning the desirability of deeper European integration .
Europe has come a long way from the days when its leaders prophesied that the euro would quickly rival the dollar as a global reserve currency .
yet no one should write off Europe .
it still has great strengths , and , with sensible reforms , the EU can survive and eventually return to greater prosperity and stability .
but Europe remains closer to the beginning of that process of renewal than to the end .
Whither North Korea ?
Seoul - According to North Korean state television , the heart attack that killed Kim Jong @-@ il on December 17 was &quot; due to severe mental and physical stress from overwork . &quot;
that report instantly raised a question in my mind : if we accept the regime &apos;s diagnosis , why did Kim need to work so hard , despite his frail health ?
in some sense , his sudden death seems to symbolize the helplessness of a desperate leader confronting overwhelming challenges .
seen in this light , the more important question is whether or not Kim &apos;s inexperienced son , the twenty @-@ something &quot; Great Successor &quot; Kim Jong @-@ un , will be able to consolidate power and somehow steer the country out of its deep malaise .
so far , the succession in Pyongyang seems to be proceeding in an orderly fashion .
but , despite appearances , few totalitarian regimes , save those of Hitler , Stalin , and Mao , have ever maintained a monolithic inner circle of power .
North Korea is unlikely to be an exception to this rule .
the legitimacy of Kim Jong @-@ un &apos;s claim to power is weak , despite his blood tie to his father and grandfather , the dynasty that has ruled North Korea since its inception .
the &quot; Great Successor &quot; has had barely two years of on @-@ the @-@ job training , compared to the 14 years his father spent studying directly under Kim Il @-@ sung .
of course , Kim Jong @-@ il &apos;s sister , Kim Kyung @-@ hee , and his sister @-@ in @-@ law , Jang Seong @-@ taek , will assume something of a regency role , acting both as patron to the Great Successor and as a force to mobilize the military to close ranks behind the Kim dynasty .
but it is not clear how faithfully , and for how long , Kim Kyung @-@ hee and Jang will remain supportive of Kim Jong @-@ un .
they might even try to supplant Kim by claiming power for themselves .
another challenge may come from the country &apos;s senior leaders , especially among the military . will they remain faithful to Kim , who is 40 @-@ 50 years their junior ?
it is known that some senior military officers were quietly critical of Kim Jong @-@ il &apos;s failure in managing the country &apos;s relationship with the United States and Japan .
their expectation might have been that North Korea could improve relations with the US while retaining its nuclear weapons , in exchange for not developing long @-@ range missiles .
after all , if Pakistan did it , why not North Korea ?
had that happened , economic assistance from the US and Japan would have flowed into North Korea , enabling the regime to manage the country &apos;s moribund economy much better without initiating reforms , which the military appears to regard as dangerous .
instead , with the economy , particularly food production , continuing to falter , perhaps one @-@ third of the country is living at or below starvation levels .
will Kim Jong @-@ un leader be able to do better ?
in the early stages of this precarious succession , China has behaved as expected , trying to prop up the regime in order to ensure stability in its nuclear @-@ armed neighbor .
China &apos;s foreign ministry sent a strong message of support for Kim Jong @-@ un , and encouraged North Koreans to unite under the new leader .
but the key external factor in ensuring a peaceful succession will be the policies of South Korea and the US , which must decide whether they can work with the North in the post @-@ Kim Jong @-@ il era .
will they wait to see what happens to the new leader , and thus continue their policy of &quot; strategic patience , &quot; which focuses mainly on denuclearization , and not move on to other areas until the North moves first ?
in that case , North Korea will gradually become more unstable , despite China &apos;s support , as economic collapse undermines its quasi @-@ legitimate leadership .
or will South Korea and the US try to take advantage of Kim Jong @-@ il &apos;s passing with new policy initiatives ?
if they can develop a two @-@ track policy framework aimed at facilitating economic reform inside North Korea while continuing international pressure for denuclearization , constructive engagement may be possible .
alas , next year is an election year in South Korea and the US .
in the feverish atmosphere of political high season , it will not be easy for incumbent administrations to pursue bold but risky policies .
this is the agony of democracy , and it is why the next year may prove to be the most unstable , and even dangerous , period in decades for the Korean peninsula and the region .
what happens if things go the wrong way ?
what if , for example , Kim Jong @-@ un fails to consolidate power , perceives the domestic political situation as worsening , owing to elite power struggles or popular discontent , and deems the external environment , especially South Korea and the US ever more hostile ?
in that case , Kim III may grasp at provocation in one form or another , as his father did with intermittent attacks on South Korea in recent years .
if things do worsen even more , the world , like it or not , must be prepared to manage - and even confront - a scenario in which the Kim dynasty , and with it the North Korean state , collapses .
unfortunately , considering the current state of ill @-@ preparedness in terms of international coordination , there will be confusion , misunderstanding , and overreaction among South Korea , the US , and China to other actors &quot; behavior .
so it is past time for all three powers , together with Japan and Russia , to start talking and planning ahead , jointly .
a chaotic , imploding North Korea is in no one &apos;s interest .
Whither Pakistan ?
Lahore - Pakistan remains the world &apos;s never @-@ ending question .
as 2010 concludes , several outstanding issues continue to bedevil the country .
how they are managed in the year ahead will determine not only Pakistan &apos;s immediate future and long @-@ term prospects , but also the security of its region and , indeed , much of the world .
it has been said - without exaggeration - that Pakistan faces an existential threat .
the country has not defined a coherent approach towards those who are resorting to terrorism to advance their agendas , both within Pakistan and abroad .
it remains uncommitted to the idea of denying sanctuaries on its territory to Taliban fighters battling American and NATO troops in Afghanistan .
relations with India have soured in recent months , because Pakistan &apos;s government is once again lending diplomatic support to the insurgency in Indian @-@ controlled Kashmir .
domestic terrorism in Pakistan has taken a heavy human and economic toll .
it is no longer aimed at official support of United States @-@ led anti @-@ terrorism activities .
Sunni Islamic extremists now target minority groups as well as other Muslim sects .
some 800 liberal and Sufi Islamic scholars have died in targeted killings by extremist groups who receive financial assistance from like @-@ minded people in the Middle East , and some well @-@ known and much @-@ visited Sufi shrines have been bombed .
the economy is in shambles , and unable to meet the International Monetary Fund demands for its continued support .
if the IMF terminates its current program , Pakistan will be unable to service its foreign debt .
indeed , a senior cabinet minister suggested recently that the international community should write off Pakistan &apos;s debts - an amount estimated at $ 40 billion .
the minister of finance forcefully repudiated the suggestion the following day , indicating that the government has not developed a consistent approach towards the faltering economy .
the economy was also badly hurt by the massive floods of 2010 , which caused damage estimated at $ 10 billion .
this damage could lower annual GDP growth by 1 @-@ 1.5 % for several years to come .
in the 2010 @-@ 2011 fiscal year , the IMF estimates that economic output will increase by less than 3 % - one @-@ third the rate expected in neighboring India and less than half that of Bangladesh .
slower economic growth will cause a shortfall of jobs for new entrants to the workforce , thereby increasing the incidence of poverty .
indeed , the number of people living in absolute poverty is likely to increase by 10 million , bringing the total to more than 70 million , or 40 % of the population .
Pakistan thus ends 2010 as the sick man of South Asia .
the political system also remains unsettled .
despite passage in July of the 18th amendment to the Pakistani constitution , which restored it to the form in which it was promulgated in 1973 , political and executive authority remains in the hands of President Asif Ali Zardari .
the changes are supposed to make the executive branch accountable to the elected parliament , expand the prime minister &apos;s authority , devolve more power to the provinces , and ensure independence to the judiciary .
in late 2009 , the president also approved the seventh National Finance Commission , which will allocate to the provinces a larger share of the revenues collected by the central government .
but a significant transfer of power from the presidency to parliament , or from the central to provincial governments , has yet to be brought about .
worse yet , the military remains outside civilian control .
general Ashfaq Pervez Kayani &apos;s term in office , which was set to expire in November , was extended by three years .
thus empowered , the general has been able to exert his influence over foreign policy , in particular in defining the country &apos;s relations with the US , India , and Afghanistan .
even though the US offered $ 2 billion of assistance to the military to be disbursed over a period of 3 @-@ 5 years , Kayani has resisted American pressure to move against the Taliban &apos;s sanctuary in North Waziristan , used to stage operations against US and NATO troops in southern and eastern Afghanistan .
so , is a further increase in violence by various extremist groups likely ?
will the economy collapse if the IMF withdraws its support ?
will the US increase its pressure by intervening militarily if Pakistan continues to harbor Taliban fighters operating from the tribal areas ?
will the military subvert the constitutional changes aimed at reforming the political system ?
despite all the grim news and auguries , there is some hope , owing to the increased political mobilization of Pakistan &apos;s middle classes , whose members have finally begun to question those espousing extremism .
the judiciary is also more active , and is attempting to force the executive to remain within the bounds of the constitution .
moreover , a trade agreement with Afghanistan that allows Afghan goods to cross Pakistan en route to India may be one step towards an improvement of economic relations with that large and rapidly growing neighbor .
indeed , an able economic team that has been installed in the government seems - at long last - to be addressing some of the economy &apos;s deep structural flaws .
as India in the 1990 &quot; s and Brazil in the early 2000 &quot; s showed , economies in deep distress can recover quickly once the right policies are implemented .
it could also happen in Pakistan , which would help to solve other , seemingly intractable problems .
so all hope is not lost in Pakistan .
on the contrary , 2011 may well prove to be a better year for a battered economy and a political system under stress .
Whither the Egyptian Revolution ?
Washington , DC - Egypt &apos;s revolution toppled a dictator in February , but the country &apos;s future as a stable , functioning democracy remains uncertain .
the West is , of course , limited in its ability to shape the transition process .
nonetheless , the potential for constructive influence remains considerable , and it should be responsive to those in Egypt who favor liberal ideas , democratic institutions , and broad distribution of the benefits of economic development .
the upcoming parliamentary elections are but an early stage in a long ( perhaps decades @-@ long ) struggle to define the new Egypt .
will Egypt gravitate toward Islamic theocracy or adopt a secular government that respects minority rights ?
which economic policies - statist , liberal , or some combination of the two - will best ensure social justice and broad distribution of prosperity ?
can civilian control of the military be established ?
will the regional security structure formed around the United States , Egypt , and Israel survive ?
the November elections will not resolve these fundamental questions , and whether a workable constitutional framework will develop is uncertain .
a parliamentary system of government will likely emerge , including a prime minister and a cabinet , with the strong possibility that the presidency will be politically overshadowed , particularly if the presidential election is delayed .
the central unknown is the composition of the ruling coalition .
it appears unlikely that a single party will emerge from the election with enough parliamentary seats to govern on its own .
so a coalition government will be necessary .
the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood ( the Freedom and Justice Party ) currently is the best @-@ organized party , and may be in the strongest position to form a majority coalition , including Salafist elements .
by contrast , secular liberal parties have yet to develop effective organizations or project compelling visions for the future .
although sentiment favoring a secular state is considerable , a coalition that can serve as an alternative or counterweight to the Muslim Brotherhood will be difficult to assemble .
in the near term , the most likely counterweight could be a liberal coalition with a heavy component of former members of deposed President Hosni Mubarak &apos;s National Democratic Party ( NDP ) - that is , those who have not been discredited by their association with Mubarak .
election rules favor those who were organized before the revolution .
approximately one @-@ third of the new parliament will comprise &quot; non @-@ party list &quot; candidates .
established networks based on family , local loyalties , and tribal affiliations will be key determinants in voting . these circumstances may favor &quot; non @-@ party list &quot; candidates associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and the former NDP , particularly in rural Egypt .
post @-@ election shifts in the composition of coalitions could complicate the situation , making governance even more difficult .
power @-@ sharing among coalition partners will be an intricate affair , including behind @-@ the @-@ scenes deals with the military , which will insist on measures to safeguard its interests .
the political atmosphere in Egypt remains volatile .
expectations of economic improvement are extremely high .
the initial elected government may pay an early political price for failure .
the starting point for the West in trying to assist Egypt &apos;s transition must be recognition that patient , long @-@ term engagement will be required .
the effectiveness of this engagement will depend primarily on the persuasiveness of the West &apos;s policy prescriptions , rather than on the volume of financial assistance .
G @-@ 8 countries have already pledged support to post @-@ Mubarak Egypt , including economic aid , debt relief , and loan guarantees .
these steps are important , though delivery will be prolonged and the likely impact modest , at least in the near @-@ term .
Egypt has already declined support from the International Monetary Fund .
but , apart from an IMF @-@ backed reform program , if the Egyptian government &apos;s policy framework is right , resources will flow from the private sector , including foreign investment supportive of job creation and economic development .
this is the message that Egypt needs to grasp and embrace .
G @-@ 8 governments should urgently and repeatedly undertake quiet , structured , and consistent communications with Egyptian counterparts about the economic reforms needed to bring about prosperity .
it is far too early to judge the strength of internal forces promoting liberal economic policies .
the need for economic growth could intrinsically push policymakers toward market @-@ oriented economic policies ( sensitive to considerations of &quot; social justice &quot; ) and an open investment environment .
powerful forces within the Egyptian business community are silent at the moment , but in time will reassert themselves .
many business interests with job @-@ creating capacity want the continuation of market @-@ oriented reforms begun a decade ago ( which produced impressive growth rates ) , but support broadening prosperity and rooting out corruption .
moreover , an independent media might tend to reinforce pro @-@ market and democratic sentiment .
indeed , Western governments should continue to use their channels to the Egyptian military and future civil leadership to encourage them to uphold the rule of law , to act with restraint , and to respect free expression .
regional security arrangements will also require careful maintenance .
finally , countries supportive of a democratic Egypt should focus on encouraging the institutional and social underpinnings of democratic process and market reform .
this depends on the development of a robust civil society , tolerant of open debate , and healthy liberal political parties , as well as active participation by women and an independent media .
winning broad public support will take time .
private non @-@ profit organizations and private enterprise , rather than governments directly , are best equipped to provide this type of training and expertise for leadership development and capacity building .
the job of democratic governments is to provide the resources that can make delivery of this aid possible .
who Are Tomorrow &apos;s Consumers ?
Singapore - Luxury @-@ brand companies &quot; stock prices plunged in July , after their financial results disappointed investors , owing largely to slower sales in emerging markets , especially in China .
meanwhile , news reports indicate that high @-@ end shopping malls in India and China are increasingly empty .
what is going on ?
many analysts had expected emerging markets to generate exponential growth over the next decade .
but now there is talk of how the global crisis is slowing down these economies and killing off discretionary spending .
but a slowdown in China &apos;s economic growth cannot really be blamed for slower sales of luxury goods or empty malls .
the annual growth rate of China &apos;s $ 7.5 trillion economy decelerated to 7.6 % in the second quarter , from 8.1 % in January @-@ March - hardly a cause for panic .
moreover , two @-@ thirds of the decline is attributable to slower investment rather than slower consumption .
for all of China &apos;s long @-@ term structural problems , it is not exactly slipping into recession .
the real problem is that many analysts had exaggerated the size of the luxury @-@ goods segment in emerging markets .
China is by far the largest emerging @-@ market economy , with 1.6 million households that can be called &quot; rich &quot; ( defined as having annual disposable income of more than $ 150,000 ) .
but this is still smaller than Japan &apos;s 4.6 million and a fraction of the 19.2 million rich households in the United States .
the number of rich households amounts to barely 0.7 million in India and one million in Brazil .
the point is that developed countries still dominate the income bracket that can afford luxury goods .
the explosive growth recorded by this segment in emerging markets in recent years reflected entry into previously untapped markets , with the subsequent slowdown resulting from saturation .
the number of high @-@ income households is still growing , but not enough to justify the 30 @-@ 40 % compounded growth rates expected by some .
this does not mean that growth opportunities in emerging markets have disappeared , but expectations do need to be recalibrated .
despite the economic boom of the last decade , China still has 164 million households that can be called &quot; poor &quot; ( with annual disposable income of less than $ 5,000 ) and another 172 million that are &quot; aspirant &quot; ( between $ 5,000- $ 15,000 ) . similarly , India has 104 million poor households and 107 million aspirant households .
the real story for the next two decades will be these countries &quot; shift to middle @-@ class status .
although other emerging regions will undergo a similar shift , Asia will dominate this transformation .
a study by the economist Homi Kharas of the Brookings Institution gives us a sense of the scale of this change .
he estimates that 18 % of the world &apos;s middle class lived in North America in 2009 , while another 36 % lived in Europe . Asia &apos;s share was 28 % ( after including Japan ) .
but Kharas &apos;s projections suggest that Asia will account for two @-@ thirds of the world &apos;s middle class by 2030 .
in other words , Asia will displace not just the West , but even other emerging regions .
this is the real business opportunity .
of course , the rise of Asia &apos;s middle class is not the only change we should expect .
we are in the middle of a social and demographic shift that will both destroy and create consumer markets .
the aging of developed markets is well known , but the latest data show that emerging markets are aging at an even faster pace .
China &apos;s median age is today 34.5 years , compared to 36.9 years for the US .
however , the average Chinese will be 42.5 years old by 2030 , compared to 39.1 for the average American . the median Russian will be even older , at 43.3 years .
the impact of aging is already being felt in these countries &quot; education systems .
the number of students enrolled in primary schools in China has fallen by 18 % since 1990 , and by an astonishing 33 % in South Korea .
at the other end of the demographic scale , the share of the aged is growing explosively .
meanwhile , the nature of the basic consuming unit - the household - is also changing rapidly .
in most developed countries , the traditional nuclear family is in severe decline and is being replaced by single @-@ individual households .
in Germany , for example , 39 % of households consist of just one person .
couples with children now account for barely 19 % and 22 % of households in the United Kingdom and the US , respectively .
nevertheless , it is not all about consumer atomization .
we are simultaneously witnessing the re @-@ emergence of the multigenerational extended family , with as many as 22 % of American adults in the 25 @-@ 35 age group living with parents or relatives .
by contrast , the extended family is giving way in India to nuclear families , which now account for 64 % of households .
all of these changes will profoundly affect the future of consumer markets .
for example , we need to revise our mental image of the nuclear family from American suburbia to fit the rapidly expanding cities of India .
by the same token , our mental image of the multigenerational extended family needs to include those in the West .
an aging but increasingly middle @-@ class Asia will be at the core of this new consumer landscape .
who beats Corruption ?
corruption undermines the quality of life for people around the world , not only in poor countries .
the US currently is witnessing several corruption scandals .
even America &apos;s Federal Emergency Management Agency , responsible for providing relief after natural disasters and man @-@ made catastrophes , was in the hands of inept political cronies rather than professionals .
when hurricane Katrina struck America &apos;s Gulf Coast , that incompetence proved fatal .
all societies require an effective government that can provide vital and irreplaceable public services and infrastructure .
thus , governments are invested with unique powers , especially the powers of policing and judicial control .
but these powers are also readily abused .
how , then , to ensure that governments are law @-@ abiding as well as strong ?
the best answer , both in theory and practice , is to find ways to hold governments accountable to the people that they serve .
elections are obviously one method , though campaign financing can be a source of corruption .
politicians around the world trade favors for cash needed to win elections , and they often use that cash to buy the votes of desperately poor people .
clear electoral rules and procedures can help ensure transparency , but accountability also comes from the broad society in between elections .
privately owned newspapers , independent radio and television networks , trade unions , churches , professional societies , and other groups within civil society provide a bulwark against despotism .
in the poorest countries , where illiteracy is high , desperate people are subject to government manipulation , and there is a lack of independent control through the media and professional organizations , governments face only weak control by society .
they tend to be the most despotic and corrupt , not because poor people care less about good governance - on the contrary , their very lives depend on it - but because they lack the means to keep their government disciplined and law abiding .
the result is a trap in which poverty causes bad governance and bad governance causes poverty - a two @-@ way spiral downward that can lead to such extreme deprivation that the government , lacking computers , telephones , information systems , and trained civil servants , couldn &apos;t function honestly even if it wanted to .
the end result can be collapse into a kind of anarchy , as in Liberia , Sierra Leone , and Somalia .
one measure of the quality of governance in over 150 countries is provided by Transparency International , an organization dedicated to strengthening civil society in the fight against government corruption .
transparency International produces an annual ranking of &quot; corruption perceptions , &quot; measuring the public &apos;s view of the extent of corruption in a country .
in the 2005 rankings , Iceland scored as the least corrupt country , with the Scandinavian countries , New Zealand , and Singapore close behind .
the US ranked seventeenth from the top , a not @-@ so @-@ glorious position for the world &apos;s leading power .
in general , the poorer the country , the lower the ranking : tied for last place are Chad and Bangladesh .
a bit of statistical analysis reveals further important patterns .
first , Sub @-@ Saharan African countries are less corrupt on average than countries at the same income level in other parts of the world .
for example , Burkina Faso , Ghana , Mali , and Rwanda rank much higher than Bangladesh , Indonesia , Pakistan , and Vietnam . yet the Asian countries &quot; economies have tended to grow much faster over the past generation .
corruption therefore cannot be the unique factor that holds Africa back .
Africa &apos;s problems have more to do with droughts , malaria , AIDS , and lack of infrastructure .
poor countries achieve lower levels of corruption when civil rights are protected .
when people have the freedom to assemble , to speak , and to publish their views , society benefits not only by increasing the range of ideas that are debated , but also by keeping corruption in check .
it is no surprise that corrupt regimes routinely clamp down on the press , trade unions , and on professional associations .
in Africa , less corrupt countries like Ghana also have much better protection of civil liberties than more corruption @-@ prone countries like Chad and Ethiopia , which are also even poorer .
finally , the data show that corruption is highest in oil and gas @-@ producing countries .
in general , natural resources like oil , gas , diamonds , and other precious minerals breed corruption , because governments can live off of their export earnings without having to &quot; compromise &quot; with their own societies .
the natural resources are therefore not only a target of corruption but also an instrument of holding power .
many foreign companies , intent on cashing in , fuel the pathology of corrupt regimes by peddling in bribes and political protection .
the implications for action are clear .
by strengthening civil society - through legal rights and long @-@ term economic development - and instituting clear rules to ensure accountability , political despotism and corruption will be brought under control .
we should be uncompromising , therefore , in our defense of civil liberties .
the rich world should offer impoverished regions like sub @-@ Saharan Africa more economic support to break out of poverty .
of course , aid should be directed to specific needs - for example , malaria control , food production , safe drinking water , and sanitation - whose fulfillment can be measured and monitored to resist corruption .
by raising living standards , we would also be empowering both civil society and impoverished governments to defend the rule of law .
breaking the WHO &apos;s Glass Ceiling
Toronto / NEW YORK - This year , the World Health Organization will elect a new Director @-@ General .
last September , WHO member states nominated six candidates for the position : Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , Flavia Bustreo , Philippe Douste @-@ Blazy , David Nabarro , Sania Nishtar , and Miklós Szócska .
on January 25 , the WHO Executive Board will shortlist three candidates ; and in May , the World Health Assembly will elect one of those candidates to succeed Margaret Chan .
all of the candidates have presented a vision for how they would lead the organization , and we personally know and admire several of them .
but , ultimately , we believe that Ghebreyesus is the most qualified person for the job .
our endorsement is based on three considerations that are important in any hiring process , and especially for a position such as this : the candidate &apos;s past achievements , leadership style , and the diversity that he or she brings to the table .
with respect to the first consideration , Ghebreyesus has a proven track record of success .
as Ethiopia &apos;s health minister from 2005 to 2012 , he championed the interests of all of the country &apos;s citizens , and strengthened primary @-@ care services .
he created 3,500 health centers and 16,000 health posts , and dramatically expanded the health @-@ care workforce by building more medical schools and deploying more 38,000 community @-@ based health extension workers .
Ghebreyesus &apos;s efforts now serve as a model that other countries seek to emulate as they try to achieve universal health coverage for their citizens .
he is the only candidate who has achieved such results at a national level .
Ghebreyesus is also a longtime champion and advocate of gender equality and the rights of women and girls .
in fact , his efforts to strengthen Ethiopia &apos;s health system played a crucial role in more than doubling the percentage of Ethiopian women with access to contraception , and in reducing maternal mortality by 75 % .
when Ghebreyesus was Ethiopia &apos;s foreign minister from 2012 to 2016 , he gained extensive diplomatic experience , not least by leading negotiations for the Addis Ababa Action Agenda , the international community &apos;s plan to finance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals .
this same knack for diplomacy is now needed to bring WHO member states together for cooperative action on collective health challenges .
Ghebreyesus &apos;s leadership style is also perfectly suited for this role : he speaks last , and encourages others to share their views .
he also knows how to spot and nurture talent , and how to bring the best out of the people around him .
he would undoubtedly boost organizational morale and motivate the staff to deliver maximum value and efficiency - to the benefit of all member states and their citizens .
and while he is a receptive listener , he is also decisive , which is an attribute for the leader of the world &apos;s foremost health institution , especially during global public @-@ health emergencies .
then there is Ghebreyesus &apos;s extensive leadership experience within global health institutions .
as Board Chair of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis , and Malaria between 2009 and 2011 , and as Chair of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership between 2007 and 2009 , Ghebreyesus pushed through sweeping changes that dramatically improved both organizations &quot; operations .
what &apos;s more , he helped them raise record @-@ breaking financial commitments from donors : $ 11.7 billion for the Global Fund , and $ 3 billion for Roll Back Malaria .
this is precisely the kind experience and expertise that the WHO needs in today &apos;s global health environment , and it explains why the African Union has officially endorsed Ghebreyesus &apos;s candidacy .
amazingly , in its almost 70 @-@ year history , the WHO has never had a Director @-@ General from Africa .
this fact alone is not a reason to pick a candidate ; but in Ghebreyesus &apos;s case , his direct experience working in developing countries makes him uniquely qualified to tackle our toughest global health problems , which tend to hit developing countries the hardest .
it is time to break the WHO &apos;s African @-@ leadership glass ceiling .
sustainable development is truly achievable only when leaders of global institutions are from the communities most affected by those institutions &quot; work .
Ghebreyesus &apos;s candidacy presents the WHO with an historic opportunity , which its Executive Board should seize on January 25 .
who is Gordon Brown ?
at long last , Gordon Brown is taking over from Tony Blair as Britain &apos;s Prime Minister , thus attaining his life @-@ long ambition , as if by right .
that is his first problem .
he has not been elected by anyone - not by the Labour Party , and not by Britain &apos;s voters ; he has merely come into an inheritance that he has long thought was his due .
how , then , will Brown acquire legitimacy as Britain &apos;s new leader ?
the one thing that is clear is that he will not gain legitimacy if he offers only more of what Blair has been dishing up for the past ten years .
Brown &apos;s second problem is the mirror image of the first .
as a senior member of Blair &apos;s government throughout its tenure , he shares responsibility for everything that Blair has done .
political commentators sometimes claim to detect important differences in their underlying political attitudes .
however , in practice , Brown has remained in the shadows , skillfully managing the economy , but remaining silent and enigmatic on vital political issues , and apparently endorsing everything Blair did .
if Brown is to gain legitimacy , he must offer something new ; but he can do that only by distinguishing himself from the Blair legacy in clearly perceptible - and therefore fairly radical - ways .
this will be a difficult trick to pull off .
perhaps the single most important domestic question Brown faces concerns where he stands on the balance between the free market and the claims of social policy .
Blair &apos;s government moved the Labour Party a long way to the right of its traditional priorities of protecting the underprivileged , and to justify the change he re @-@ named the party &quot; New Labour . &quot;
in many ways , the Blair government &apos;s support of free @-@ market policies turned out to be a shrewd and productive shift .
Britain &apos;s economy grew more steadily and rapidly than it had done for several generations , and the tax revenue generated by growth enabled the government to pour money into education and the National Health Service .
but this has come at a price , or rather several prices .
first , inequality has grown at both ends of the income scale .
at the bottom , the proportion of the population with an income below the poverty line increased from 13 % at the start of Blair &apos;s government to 20 % now .
that situation is much worse among ethnic minorities .
and , despite the government &apos;s efforts , childhood poverty also has increased under Blair .
at the top , the incomes of the mega @-@ rich have soared , with predictable repercussions , especially in the property market .
public concern about this issue has been made much worse by claims that the rich get even richer by paying little tax .
there was a time when Brown was thought to be a believer in traditional Labour Party values .
was it true ?
is it true now ?
what will he say about inequality ?
unfortunately , Blair and his government are perceived to be tainted by some of the less attractive features of free @-@ market capitalism .
Blair himself seems to prefer to have &quot; friends &quot; who are very rich and who will lend him their holiday villas in Tuscany .
this &quot; closeness &quot; has led the police to investigate claims that some Labour Party donors have been rewarded with political honors .
in short , Blair &apos;s government exudes an aura of sleaze and cronyism .
can Brown show that he is different ?
the worst part of Blair &apos;s legacy , of course , is the war in Iraq .
many people predicted , and everyone can now see , that the decision to invade was a disastrous error ; that it is having catastrophic consequences , not just for Iraq , but also for the Middle East generally ; and that it has seriously damaged the moral standing of the United States and Britain .
the most critical issue facing Brown is whether he chooses to distance himself from Blair &apos;s self @-@ satisfied and delusional claim that the invasion of Iraq was &quot; the right thing to do . &quot;
Britain has already reduced its forces in southern Iraq , and is on course to reduce them still further as they hand over &quot; security &quot; to the Iraqi police and military .
in reality , of course , the civil and guerrilla war under way in the rest of Iraq means that any security in the south can only be a temporary illusion .
the choice facing Brown is whether to cling silently to the existing policy , in the futile hope that the problem will go away , or explicitly recognize Britain &apos;s share in the disaster .
this is partly a question of what to do now in Iraq ; but it is also a question of Britain &apos;s relationship with the US .
with hindsight , it is clear that Britain &apos;s participation in the Iraq war was driven solely by Blair &apos;s determination to stick limpet @-@ like to the US .
Brown believes , and has said , that Britain must always be close friends with America ; and obviously that is the right thing to believe and say .
but is he prepared to make clear that there is a difference between being close friends and going into an illegal and disastrous war just to please George W Bush ?
so far , there is no indication that he will .
while he has publicly regretted the errors in British intelligence about Saddam Hussein , that is merely a way of shifting the blame from the government to the intelligence services .
but it was not the intelligence services that decided to go to war ; it was Tony Blair , with the support of Gordon Brown .
who is to Blame ?
Princeton - Now that the economic crisis looks less threatening ( at least for the moment ) , and forecasters are spying &quot; green shoots &quot; of recovery , an ever more encompassing blame game is unfolding .
the financial crisis provides an apparently endless opportunity for unmasking deceit , malfeasance , and corruption .
but we are not sure quite who and what should be unmasked .
leading bankers were initially the most obvious culprits .
they presided over institutions that made large profits for a substantial period of time by mispricing risk , and then argued for public support on the grounds that they were too big to fail .
they appeared arrogant and overpaid , and were easily demonized .
but what about the political process ?
why were the banks not more closely controlled and better regulated ?
it is not that politicians were &quot; bought &quot; in a simple sense ; rather , they convinced themselves that financial innovation opened the gate to greater general prosperity , increased home ownership , and , of course , popular support in elections .
governments are now vulnerable , and politicians are under attack almost everywhere .
administrations have collapsed in the Czech Republic , Hungary , Iceland , and Ireland .
riots and paralyzing strikes have crippled Thailand , France , and Greece .
in Kuwait , the government dismissed parliament .
Britain is convulsed by a scandal about parliamentary expenses that has no equivalent since the attacks on &quot; old corruption &quot; in the early nineteenth century .
recriminations after financial crises have a long history , and they recur in regular cycles .
the stock exchange boom of the early 1870 &quot; s was followed by collapse in 1873 and a witch @-@ hunt for those responsible .
in 1907 , J.P. Morgan was first viewed as the savior of the market , and then as the enemy of the commonweal .
in the 1930 &quot; s , bankers and finance ministers were accused .
but for the rest of the twentieth century , the backlash cycle seemed to have stopped .
today the attacks are not limited to the political and financial establishment .
critics are trying to identify the ideas as well as the interests that were responsible for financial and economic dysfunction .
in this respect , the contemporary crisis is unlike the historical analogies , in that it looks as if financial innovation was driven by a set of intellectual and even technological innovations .
since it is an economic crisis , most people seeking its intellectual roots are tempted to begin with economists , who , with a few exceptions , look particularly discredited .
the founder of the rational expectations revolution , Robert Lucas , is endlessly quoted as having stated in 2003 in his presidential address to the American Economic Association that the &quot; central problem of depression @-@ prevention has been solved , for all practical purposes , and has in fact been solved for many decades . &quot;
it is also clear that academic economists had an impact on policy .
Larry Summers , now the highly influential director of President Barack Obama &apos;s National Economic Council , concluded as a young economist that &quot; financial and monetary shocks are less important sources of depression than we had suspected . &quot;
if the economy was foolproof , and if so many good policy options existed to deal with crisis and distress , there was less need to avoid mistakes .
things could always be set right retrospectively .
other academic disciplines have looked rather smugly at the public humiliation of their colleagues in economics .
the non @-@ mathematical appear to have their revenge , as the perils of over @-@ reliance on complex symbolic notation and arcane formulae are relentlessly exposed .
in fact , developments or fashions in other academic disciplines and also in the general culture contributed at least as much to a willingness to engage in absurd risks and to provide and accept valuations of complex and inherently unfathomable securities .
the general cultural developments are sometimes termed post @-@ modernism , which involves the replacement of reason by intuition , feeling , and allusion .
but post @-@ modernism has itself been generated by technology , with which it has a deeply ambiguous relationship .
in contrast to a steam engine or an old @-@ fashioned automobile , whose operations were easily comprehensible , modern automobiles or airplanes are so complicated that their operators have no idea how the technology they are using actually works .
the Internet has created a world in which strict logic is less important than the juxtaposition of striking images .
post @-@ modernism moves away from the rational culture of the so @-@ called &quot; modern era . &quot;
many people are finding more analogies with medieval life , in which humans were surrounded by processes that they found difficult to comprehend . as a result , they thought they lived in a world populated by demons and mysterious forces .
the recent era of global finance - perhaps we should speak of it as being past ? - differed from the financial surge of a century ago .
its cultural manifestations also appeared to be novel .
it was playful , allusive , and edgy - in short , post @-@ modern .
it treated tradition and history not as a constraint , but as a source of ironic reference .
at the era &apos;s height , major financial players built vastly expensive collections of highly abstract modern art .
a post @-@ modern neglect or disdain for reality generated the sense that the whole world was constantly shifting and malleable , and might be as transient and meaningless as stock quotations .
an alliance was formed between financial experts who thought they were selling truly innovative ideas , a political elite that endorsed the philosophy of &quot; regulation lite , &quot; and a cultural climate that pushed experimentation and the rejection of traditional values .
the result was that every sort of value - including financial values - came to be seen as arbitrary and fundamentally absurd .
when incomprehension no longer produces new heights of prosperity , but rather economic collapse and failure , it is not surprising that it turns to anger .
finding out who is to blame becomes more and more like the late medieval and early modern search for witches : a way of making sense of a disorderly and hostile universe .
who Lost Turkey ?
Paris - &quot; Who lost Turkey ? &quot;
that question , often raised in the past , has been heating up in the aftermath of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan &apos;s emotional outburst during the recent World Economic Forum 2009 in Davos , when he abruptly left a panel he was sharing with Israeli President Shimon Peres .
and the Turkish question matters greatly , because it touches on some of the most unstable and unsettling of the world &apos;s diplomatic disputes .
if Turkey has indeed been &quot; lost , &quot; those responsible include the European Union , the United States , Israel , and Turkey itself .
the EU &apos;s growing reservations about Turkey &apos;s membership have been expressed unambiguously by French President Nicolas Sarkozy .
in the US , former President George W. Bush gets some of the blame because of the war in Iraq .
Israel , too , has played its part in Turkey &apos;s alienation from the West , as a result of the Lebanon war of 2006 and its recent military operations in Gaza .
all of these events have disturbed and disoriented Turkey , and are magnified by the domestic impact of worst global economic crisis since the 1930 &quot; s .
of course , Turkey &apos;s secular , pro @-@ Western elites may still consider the EU and the US important , if not indispensable , allies and partners , and they may consider Islamic fundamentalism , Hamas , Hezbollah , and Iran real or at least potential threats .
yet they are also convinced that Europe has behaved improperly toward Turkey , through a combination of short @-@ term populist reflexes and the absence of a long @-@ term strategic vision .
the Turkish question is , of course , complex .
Turkey &apos;s geography is predominantly Asian , Turkey &apos;s emotions are increasingly Middle Eastern , i.e. , Muslim on the Israeli @-@ Palestinian conflict , and yet Turkey &apos;s elites remain resolutely pro @-@ Western and pro @-@ European .
but for how long ?
at the beginning of the twenty @-@ first century , when dialogue with the Islamic world is one of the Western world &apos;s key challenges , Europe would commit a historic strategic blunder if it were to close its doors to Turkey .
to do so would push back the inheritors of the Ottoman Empire back onto an Asian , Muslim , and Middle Eastern historical trajectory .
in the question of Turkish accession to the EU , the journey matters more than the destination .
the reforms that Turkey has already implemented in a very short period of time , thanks to its EU candidate status , are impressive .
should we in Europe really put at risk that progress by expressing an all @-@ too @-@ audible &quot; no &quot; ?
the EU desperately needs a strategic and diplomatic partner that can significantly reinforce its clout in the Middle East .
Europe also needs the dynamism of a youthful Turkey .
above all , it needs the message of reconciliation sent to Islam that Turkey &apos;s entrance into the Union would represent .
of course , to want Turkey &quot; in &quot; is an act of will , if not an act of faith that is in many ways counterintuitive .
most Europeans do not perceive Turkey as a &quot; European Other &quot; but as a &quot; non @-@ European Other . &quot;
even in Istanbul , the most Westernized of Turkish cities , as soon as one leaves the main arteries , one seems to be immersed in a Middle Eastern or Asian culture .
Israel is not in the European Union , but it , too , is in great danger of losing Turkey .
far from reinforcing Israel &apos;s security , its last two military adventures , in Lebanon and now in Gaza , have caused further self @-@ isolation and loss of world sympathy .
nowhere has this phenomenon been stronger than in Turkey , where those military escapades have strained the two countries &quot; strategic alliance almost to the breaking point .
it is too early to speak of Obama &apos;s policy towards Turkey ; suffice it to say that in his willingness to open a respectful dialogue with Islam , he is the only Western leader to move in the right direction .
but can positive American gestures towards Turkey , a key NATO member , be sufficient to offset Israel &apos;s insensitive , if not reckless , policies ?
the answer is unclear .
Turkey , too shares some of the responsibility for this mounting process of estrangement . Erdogan &apos;s behavior in Davos was , at the very least , irresponsible .
he may have gained popularity back home , but in today &apos;s difficult economic times , the temptations of cheap populism are more dangerous than ever .
one does not play lightly with matches next to a pile of dry wood .
who Needs a Flat Tax ?
Washington , DC - With America &apos;s Republican presidential candidates lining up to declare their fealty to a flat tax - a system of personal @-@ income taxation that assesses a single rate for all - opponents have focused on why it is a bad idea to raise taxes on the poor in order to reduce them for the wealthy .
but , if a flat tax is such a bad idea , why have so many countries embraced it ?
a careful study of these countries - mainly post @-@ communist countries in Eastern Europe and a smattering of tiny micro @-@ states worldwide - suggests that there are three main reasons .
first , some countries are so relatively poor and lacking in domestic capital that they opt to drop rates in order to attract foreign investors .
other countries are so small and ineffective at collecting revenue that they cannot afford a progressive tax system .
finally , some countries are so corrupt that they have to offer the wealthy a huge rate cut to get them to pay any taxes at all .
the United States , like other developed countries , does not suffer from any of these conditions ( yet ) , so it is not clear why it needs a flat tax .
the formerly communist countries of Eastern Europe that have adopted a flat tax - including Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Macedonia , Romania , Slovakia , and Ukraine , among others - sorely lack investment capital .
whether on the European Union &apos;s doorstep or just inside , they compete for the attention of foreign direct investors , for whom a flat tax provides an important signal : you are welcome , we will not steal your money , and you can keep what you earn .
for developed countries that already have capital and a track record of inward investment , &quot; the appeal of the flat tax is consequently less , &quot; as a report by the International Monetary Fund concludes .
thus , the flat tax has not been adopted in any developed countries , or in China .
the other countries that have embraced a flat tax are small or micro @-@ states : Jamaica , Tuvalu , Grenada , Mauritius , Timor @-@ Leste , Belize , and Seychelles .
the only ( partial ) exception to this rule is Paraguay , which adopted a flat tax in 2010 .
here , flat @-@ tax advocates &quot; administrative @-@ simplicity arguments have some traction .
if a country is so small that it cannot develop a tax administration effective enough to manage a fair system of progressive taxation , then a flat tax may make sense .
moreover , some small countries have other sources of revenue , so the benefit of implementing a progressive tax system does not justify the cost .
Tuvalu &apos;s government , for example , derives nearly 10 % of its revenues from the sale of rights to its . &quot; TV &quot; Internet domain name , which brings in about $ 2 million annually .
countries that are just slightly larger can afford to collect income taxes in a fairer way .
finally , if a country &apos;s public institutions are in the thrall of oligarchs who are accustomed to stealing with impunity from the public till , a flat tax may be the only way to induce the wealthy to pay any tax at all .
thus , in 2001 Russia became the first large state to adopt a flat tax , reducing the top marginal rate from 30 % to 13 % .
in 2003 , Ukraine dropped its top rate from 40 % to 13 % .
in nearly all countries that have introduced a flat tax , government revenues from income tax have declined .
that is why its adoption is often associated with an increase in value @-@ added tax rates ( as has occurred throughout Eastern Europe ) .
in the US , the Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain &apos;s &quot; 9 @-@ 9 @-@ 9 &quot; plan calls for a 9 % rate for personal and corporate taxes , together with a new 9 % national sales tax .
a country &apos;s tax system reflects its institutional capacity , economic circumstances , and distribution of political power .
if the US were to become the first developed country to experiment with a flat tax , that shift would tend to confirm what many suspect but hope is not true : that America is broke , desperate for inward investment , incompetently governed , and increasingly ruled by a self @-@ regarding oligarchic elite .
who Needs the Humanities ?
Warwick , UK - Nowadays , in country after country , policymakers have become obsessed with the need to strengthen science education .
but what about the humanities - all those disciplines ( literature , history , languages , and so forth ) whose relevance to economic competitiveness is not so obvious ?
we need the humanities only if we are committed to the idea of humanity .
if the humanities have become obsolete , then it may be that humanity is losing its salience .
I do not mean that we are becoming &quot; less human &quot; in the sense of &quot; inhumane . &quot;
if anything , we live in a time when traditionally human @-@ centered concerns like &quot; rights &quot; have been extended to animals , if not nature as a whole .
rather , the problem is whether there is anything distinctive about being human that makes special demands of higher education .
I believe that the answer continues to be yes .
today , it sounds old @-@ fashioned to describe the university &apos;s purpose as being to &quot; cultivate &quot; people , as if it were a glorified finishing school .
however , once we set aside its elitist history , there remains a strong element of truth to this idea , especially when applied to the humanities .
although we now think of academic disciplines , including the humanities , as being &quot; research @-@ led , &quot; this understates the university &apos;s historic role in converting the primate Homo sapiens into a creature whose interests , aspirations , and achievements extend beyond successful sexual reproduction .
what was originally called the &quot; liberal arts &quot; provided the skills necessary for this transformation .
by submitting to a common regime of speaking , writing , reading , observing , and calculating , the &quot; upright ape &quot; acquired the capacity to reason in public .
this enabled first him and then her to command authority regardless of birth , resulting in the forging of networks and even institutions whose benefits cut deeply across bloodlines .
we too easily forget that our heterogeneous societies rely on at least a watered @-@ down version of this training to maintain political and economic order .
the university began with the humanities at its heart , but today it is playing catch @-@ up with the natural sciences .
this is largely because the natural sciences have most closely imitated the productivity measures associated with industry . the result is a &quot; bigger is better &quot; mentality that stresses ever more publications , patents , and citations .
yet , this agenda tends to be pursued without much concern for how - or if - these measures feed into something of greater social , cultural , and even economic relevance .
the Science Citation Index , originally designed to help researchers discern aggregate trends in increasingly complex subject domains sciences , has helped measure productivity .
but now these trends are routinely converted into norms against which the performance of particular universities , departments , and even individual researchers is judged .
what is most easily measured has become confused with what is most worth measuring .
but , more profoundly , this entire line of thinking neglects the distinctly transformative capacity of the knowledge in which the humanities specializes .
an adequate assessment of this capacity requires looking at its multiplier effects .
as with John Maynard Keynes &apos;s notion that returns on public investment must be measured as the long @-@ term consequence of other investments that it stimulates across the economy and society , so , too , with the knowledge generated by the humanities .
this idea is lost in today &apos;s cost accounting for universities , which treats what transpires between teacher and student in the classroom as akin to what happens between producer and consumer in the market .
in both cases , it is assumed that the value of the exchanged good is decided shortly after its delivery according to how it satisfies an immediate need .
not surprisingly , students value their degree by the first job it gets them rather than the life it prepares them for over the next half @-@ century .
today , it is hard to believe that in the heyday of the welfare state , universities were both more elite and more publicly funded than they are today .
back then , it was assumed that the benefits of academic training accrued not only , or even primarily , to those who experienced it but also , and more importantly , to the rest of the population , whose lives were variously enriched by the application of the arts and sciences .
of course , this enrichment included such practical benefits as medical breakthroughs and labor @-@ saving technologies .
but the enrichment provided by the humanities was no less enduring , though its subtler nature makes it harder to track .
nevertheless , to paraphrase Keynes , every time we turn on the radio or television , read a newspaper , pick up a novel , or watch a movie , we are in the thrall of one or more dead humanists who set the terms of reference through which we see the world .
in its long history as the premier form of academic knowledge , the humanities were frequently criticized for their subversive character .
that some would now question whether the humanities have any impact at all merely reflects the crude and short @-@ sighted way in which the value of academic knowledge is measured and judged today .
perhaps that befits creatures whose lives are &quot; solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short , &quot; to recall Thomas Hobbes &quot; description of the state of nature . but it does a grave injustice to those of us who still aspire to full @-@ fledged humanity .
who Needs to Be EU President ?
whoever steps into Europe &apos;s new top job as President of the European Council will set the mold .
if it is someone of worldwide renown , the presidency will immediately be established as a post of global importance .
but if its first occupant is not a household name , the presidency will be doomed as just another of the European Union &apos;s confusing plethora of worthy senior positions that are neither valued nor understood outside Brussels .
the key point here is that Europe won &apos;t be able to upgrade the job later .
if the presidency goes to a politician who lacks fame and charisma , its place will forever be low down in the international pecking order .
of the half @-@ dozen candidates to become &quot; Europe &apos;s President , &quot; only Tony Blair needs no introduction anywhere .
all the other names in the ring have to be accompanied by a description - the former Finnish this or Austrian that .
nobody knows whether the current prime ministers of the EU &apos;s 27 member countries will choose Blair .
there is considerable lingering ill will over his role in the invasion of Iraq , and there is the inconvenient fact that he is from Euro @-@ skeptic Britain , and that many on the left view him as a leader whose &quot; third way &quot; was a betrayal of socialism .
but choosing a president for Europe isn &apos;t about Blair the man , or about the political records of any of the others who would like the job .
it is about the job itself .
Europe &apos;s problem is that it lacks a clearly identifiable leader .
as a result , despite the EU &apos;s many successes , it still speaks with too many voices .
this was among the problems that the EU &apos;s controversial Lisbon treaty was designed to fix .
it is now in the final stages of its long and difficult birth , and by the New Year should be bringing new mechanisms to bear to streamline European decision @-@ making .
the jewel in its crown is to be the appointment for a 30 @-@ month term of a full @-@ time president of the European Council , which groups the heads of EU member governments , along with a foreign policy chief who will be backed by an embryonic EU diplomatic service .
now that more than two @-@ thirds of Irish voters have reversed their country &apos;s earlier opposition to the Lisbon treaty - with only the Czech Republic &apos;s europhobic president , Václav Klaus , holding out against it - the focus is on who will fill these two jobs .
and that , in turn , has triggered a round of bitter political squabbling that threatens to negate the entire idea of a much more powerful European voice on the global stage .
the three Benelux countries , along with a few other smaller EU nations , are opposed to the new European president being from a large nation .
and there are also those who fear that a political heavyweight in the job might eclipse the EU Commission &apos;s President , former Portuguese prime minister José Manuel Barroso , who has just been confirmed for a second five @-@ year term , and devalue the role of the foreign policy chief whose authority Lisbon is due to beef up .
these are specious arguments .
the EU &apos;s external relations involve two different types of politics .
the first is the politics of world theatre , where a political figure of global stature could do much to raise the EU &apos;s profile and ensure that it has a major say in re @-@ ordering the post @-@ crisis global economic rulebook .
the second is the politics of detail , where the new foreign policy chief &apos;s role is to create a single EU stance on the wide range of issues about which European governments still have wildly different national positions .
Europe has an international image problem that in part stems from a complex institutional structure that non @-@ EU countries find baffling .
it is over @-@ represented at G @-@ 20 world summits , for instance , but the presence of four European national leaders , plus EU representatives like Barroso , weakens rather than strengthens its political weight .
the same is true of other global bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
the result is that Europe &apos;s achievements in recent years - its expansion to create a single economic market of 500 million people and its creation of the euro as a currency that challenges the dollar - are not accompanied by a significantly greater global standing .
world leaders from Barack Obama to Hu Jintao address themselves to Berlin , Paris , and London , rather than to Brussels .
the result is that EU policy proposals that could do much to advance the economic and geopolitical interests of Europeans are not as influential as they could be .
the text of the Lisbon treaty is studiously vague in its job description of the president &apos;s role - an approach that prevented trouble for treaty &apos;s framers , but merely postponed disagreement .
the real argument now taking place between Europe &apos;s national governments is about the authority that the EU &apos;s president should have .
the risk is that Europe &apos;s squabbling politicians will opt for a figurehead and miss this golden opportunity to create a global leader .
who Next at the ECB Helm ?
TILBURG , the NETHERLANDS - Two years ago , the leaders of the world &apos;s central banks were considered heroes for their efforts in preventing financial crisis from turning into Great Depression II .
today , however , central banks are being sharply criticized , and their independence is coming under severe pressure in many countries , particularly in the eurozone , as Mario Draghi , the head of the Bank of Italy , recently pointed out .
the type of person at the helm of any central bank is always important - but now more than ever , because financial crises always threaten central banks &quot; independence .
in the United States , the Federal Reserve seems to have support only of the Obama administration , hardly something of which to be proud .
Congress has disparaged the Fed &apos;s handling of the crisis , and Representative Ron Paul of Texas , who believes that the Fed &apos;s very existence is unconstitutional , will take over one of the key congressional oversight committees in January .
more than half of all Americans want politicians to have more say over monetary policy - a scary prospect in view of the historical record .
given the likelihood of a long period of sub @-@ par economic growth , increasing pressure on public finances in the eurozone , and the ongoing debate on the future of the euro , the European Central Bank has become , more than ever before , the last line of defense for Europe &apos;s common currency .
a firm ECB president , unwilling to yield to political pressure , is needed .
during the financial crisis , the ECB has had an outstanding president in the person of Jean @-@ Claude Trichet .
but his non @-@ renewable term will end in October 2011 , and European leaders are not waiting until the last moment to appoint his successor .
indeed , positioning and bargaining among the euro &apos;s member countries has already started .
first and foremost , the next ECB president should excel on monetary matters .
true , the current financial crisis has brought bank supervision to the fore .
but monetary policy , not bank supervision , is the raison d &quot; être of central banks , whereas the banks can be well handled by the newly established European Systemic Risk Board ( ESRB ) , which will be responsible for macro @-@ prudential supervision in Europe from January 1 , 2011 .
furthermore , and contrary to common belief , the ECB president need not be very diplomatic , but should be able to unite all members of the ECB &apos;s Governing Council .
as political pressure on central banks , including the ECB , increases , its president must not hesitate to criticize European politicians and , if necessary , publicly name and shame them .
the ECB &apos;s independence is its most valuable asset - indeed , it is indispensible .
a good central banker must be able to say no to politicians .
this does not mean the ECB president should pick fights whenever possible .
on the contrary , he should be able to build support for the ECB &apos;s independence .
but he should follow the maxim about politicians set down by the ECB &apos;s first president , Wim Duisenberg : &quot; I can hear them , but I do not listen . &quot;
the president should also count on support from a majority of Europeans .
unfortunately , country of origin is highly important in this respect .
given the fact that the current ECB vice @-@ president is from southern Europe ( Portugal ) , the next head of the ECB must come from northern Europe .
only someone from Germany , the Netherlands , or a Scandinavian euro country like Finland can count on support from Germans , which is crucial .
there is certainly someone to be found in the eurozone who possesses all these qualities .
in fact , there is more than one .
Draghi is one .
others include Klaus Regling , head of the European Financial Stability Facility ( EFSF ) , Axel Weber , President of the Bundesbank , and Jürgen Stark , a current member of the ECB &apos;s Executive Board .
Draghi &apos;s Italian passport and his past service at Goldman Sachs do not help him much .
Regling has a lot of experience , but none in central banking and monetary policy .
anyone who wants Stark will need a good team of lawyers to figure out how to convert his current , non @-@ renewable appointment on the Executive Board into an appointment as President without violating the ECB &apos;s rules .
given some of Weber &apos;s statements over 2010 , he could be accused of being much too undiplomatic .
Nout Wellink , currently the head of the Dutch central bank , is a wildcard candidate , as is Erkki Liikanen of the Finish central bank .
both are suitable for the post .
the final decision , of course , rests with European heads of state and government .
but , in our view , Trichet &apos;s successor will most likely answer to the name of Weber , Wellink , or Liikanen .
who owns Bolivia ?
a few months ago , Evo Morales became Bolivia &apos;s first democratically elected indigenous head of state .
indigenous groups constitute 62 % of Bolivia &apos;s population , and those with mixed blood another 30 % , but for 500 years Bolivians had been ruled by colonial powers and their descendants .
well into the twentieth century , indigenous groups were effectively deprived of a vote and a voice .
Aymara and Quechua , their languages , were not even recognized for conducting public business .
so Morales &quot; election was historic , and the excitement in Bolivia is palpable .
but Morales &quot; nationalization of Bolivia &apos;s oil and gas fields sent shock waves through the international community .
during his campaign , Morales made clear his intention to increase state control over national gas and oil .
but he had made it equally clear that he did not intend to expropriate the property of energy firms - he wanted foreign investors to stay . ( nationalization does not , of course , necessarily mean expropriation without appropriate compensation . )
perhaps surprising for modern politicians , Morales took his words seriously .
genuinely concerned about raising the incomes of his desperately poor people , he recognized that Bolivia needs foreigners &quot; expertise to achieve growth , and that this entails paying fairly for their services .
but are foreign owners getting more than a fair rate of return ?
Morales &quot; actions are widely supported by Bolivians , who see the so @-@ called privatizations ( or &quot; capitalizations &quot; ) under former President Gonzalo &quot; Goni &quot; Sanchez de Lozada as a rip @-@ off : Bolivia received only 18 % of the proceeds !
Bolivians wonder why investments of some $ 3 billion should entitle foreign investors to 82 % of the country &apos;s vast gas reserves , now estimated to be worth $ 250 billion .
while there has not yet been full disclosure of returns , or an audit of the true value of investments , it appears that investors would , at the old terms , have recouped all their money within just four years .
Bolivians also ask why foreigners reap all the benefits of today &apos;s high prices for oil and gas ?
it costs no more to extract oil or gas today than it did when prices were one @-@ third of their current level .
yet , the foreign oil companies get 82 % of the increase - in the case of oil , this would amount to a windfall for them of $ 32 a barrel or more .
no wonder that Bolivians thought they were being cheated and demanded a new deal .
on May 2 , Morales simply reversed the percentages , pending renegotiation of the contracts : the companies operating in the two largest fields would get 18 % of the production for themselves .
as part of this new deal , Bolivia should also get a larger share when prices increase . ( Bolivia may , of course , not want to bear the risk of a fall in the price , so it may strike a deal to transfer some of the downside risk to foreign companies , giving them in exchange more of the upside potential . )
to most Bolivians , what is at stake is a matter of fairness : should foreign oil and gas companies get a fair return on their capital , or a supernormal return ?
should Bolivia be paid a fair value for its resources ?
and should Bolivia , or foreign companies , reap most of the windfall gains from increases in energy prices ?
moreover , many deals were apparently done in secret by previous governments - and apparently without the approval of Congress .
indeed , because Bolivia &apos;s Constitution requires the approval of Congress for such sales , it isn &apos;t clear that Morales is nationalizing anything : the assets were never properly sold .
when a country is robbed of a national art treasure , we don &apos;t call its return &quot; re @-@ nationalization , &quot; because it belonged to the country all along .
as with many privatizations elsewhere , there are questions as to whether the foreign investors have kept their side of the bargain .
Bolivia contributed to these joint enterprises not only with resources , but also with previous investments .
the foreign companies &quot; contribution was supposed to be further investment .
but did they fully live up to their commitments ?
are accounting gimmicks being used to overstate the true value of foreign capital contributions ?
Bolivia &apos;s government has , so far , simply raised questions , and set in motion a process for ascertaining the answer .
the problem in Bolivia is a lack of transparency , both when contracts are signed and afterwards .
without transparency , it is easy for citizens to feel that they are being cheated - and they often are .
when foreign companies get a deal that is too good to be true , there is often something underhanded going on .
around the world , oil and gas companies have themselves to blame : too often , they have resisted calls for greater transparency .
in the future , companies and countries should agree on a simple principle : there should be , to paraphrase President Woodrow Wilson &apos;s memorable words , &quot; open contracts , openly and transparently arrived at . &quot;
if the Bolivians do not get fair value for their country &apos;s natural wealth , their prospects are bleak .
even if they do , they will need assistance , not only to extract their resources , but also to improve the health and education of all Bolivians - to ensure long @-@ term economic growth and social welfare .
for now , the world should celebrate the fact that Bolivia has a democratically elected leader attempting to represent the interests of the poor people of his country .
it is a historic moment .
who pays for bird Flu ?
fifty years ago , American chicken farmers found that by keeping their birds in sheds they could produce chickens for the table more cheaply and with less work than by traditional farmyard methods .
the new method spread : chickens disappeared from fields into long , windowless sheds .
factory farming was born .
it isn &apos;t called &quot; factory farming &quot; merely because those sheds look like factories .
everything about the production method is geared towards turning live animals into machines for converting grain into meat or eggs at the lowest possible cost .
walk into such a shed - if the producer will let you - and you will find up to 30,000 chickens .
the National Chicken Council , the trade association for the US chicken industry , recommends a stocking density of 85 square inches per bird - less than a standard sheet of typing paper .
when the chickens approach market weight , they cover the floor completely .
no chicken can move without having to push through other birds .
in the egg industry , hens can barely move at all , because they are crammed into wire cages , which makes it possible to stack them in tiers , one above the other .
environmentalists point out that this production method is unsustainable .
for a start , it relies on the use of fossil fuel energy to light and ventilate the sheds , and to transport the grain eaten by the chickens .
when this grain , which humans could eat directly , is fed to chickens , they use some of it to create bones and feathers and other body parts that we cannot eat .
so we get less food back than we put into the birds - and less protein , too - while disposing of the concentrated chicken manure causes serious pollution to rivers and ground water .
animal @-@ welfare advocates protest that crowding the chickens keeps them from forming a natural flock , causes them stress , and , in the case of laying hens , prevents them from even stretching their wings .
the air in the sheds is high in ammonia from bird feces , which are usually allowed to pile up for months - and in some cases for a year or more - before being cleaned out .
medical experts warn that because the birds are routinely fed antibiotics to keep them growing in such crowded , filthy , and stressful conditions , antibiotic @-@ resistant bacteria could cause a public @-@ health threat .
yet , despite these well @-@ founded criticisms , over the last 20 years factory farming - not only of chickens , but also of pigs , veal calves , dairy cows , and , in outdoor feedlots , cattle - has spread rapidly in developing countries , especially in Asia .
now we are discovering that the consequences may be far more deadly than we ever imagined .
as University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown put it after a Canadian outbreak of avian influenza , &quot; high @-@ intensity chicken rearing is a perfect environment for generating virulent avian flu viruses . &quot;
other experts agree .
in October 2005 , a United Nations task force identified as one of the root causes of the bird flu epidemic , &quot; farming methods which crowd huge numbers of animals into small spaces . &quot;
supporters of factory farming often point out that bird flu can be spread by free @-@ range flocks , or by wild ducks and other migrating birds , who may join the free @-@ range birds to feed with them or drop their feces while flying overhead .
but , as Brown has pointed out , viruses found in wild birds are generally not very dangerous .
on the contrary , it is only when these viruses enter a high @-@ density poultry operation that they mutate into something far more virulent .
by contrast , birds that are reared by traditional methods are likely to have greater resistance to disease than the stressed , genetically similar birds kept in intensive confinement systems .
moreover , factory farms are not biologically secure .
they are frequently infested with mice , rats , and other animals that can bring in diseases .
so far , a relatively small number of human beings have died from the current strain of avian influenza , and it appears that they have all been in contact with infected birds .
but if the virus mutates into a form that is transmissible between humans , the number of deaths could run into the hundreds of millions .
governments are , rightly , taking action to prepare for this threat .
recently , the US Senate approved spending $ 8 billion to stockpile vaccines and other drugs to help prevent a possible bird flu epidemic .
other governments have already spent tens of millions on vaccines and other preventive measures .
what is now clear , however , is that such government spending is really a kind of subsidy to the poultry industry . like most subsidies , it is bad economics .
factory farming spread because it seemed to be cheaper than more traditional methods .
in fact , it was cheaper only because it passed some of its costs on to others - for example , to people who lived downstream or downwind from the factory farms , and could no longer enjoy clean water and air .
now we see that these were only a small part of the total costs .
factory farming is passing far bigger costs - and risks - on to all of us .
in economic terms , these costs should be &quot; internalized &quot; by the factory farmers rather than being shifted onto the rest of us .
that won &apos;t be easy to do , but we could make a start by imposing a tax on factory @-@ farm products until enough revenue is raised to pay for the precautions that governments now have to take against avian influenza .
then we might finally see that chicken from the factory farm really isn &apos;t so cheap after all .
the US Still Runs the World
Washington , DC - Reports of the death of American power have often been greatly exaggerated .
in the 1950s the Soviet Union was thought to have surpassed the United States ; today , the Soviet Union no longer exists .
in the 1980s , Japan was widely regarded as on the verge of overtaking the US ; today , after more than two decades of Japanese stagnation , no one would take this scenario seriously .
and in the 1990s , monetary union was considered likely to propel Europe to greater global prominence ; today , the European economy is frequently in the world &apos;s headlines , but not in a good way .
now it is China &apos;s turn .
until recently , China , in many people &apos;s view , was poised to assume global leadership , if it hadn &apos;t done so already .
today , doubts about the Chinese economy &apos;s long @-@ term prospects are rattling stock markets worldwide ( including in the US ) .
China matters , and its economic policy , including how the exchange rate is managed , must be taken seriously .
but China does not run the world , and it is unlikely to do so anytime soon .
the potential for global leadership still rests , believe it or not , with the US .
the best case for taking China seriously as a world power is made in Arvind Subramanian &apos;s best @-@ selling book Eclipse : living in the Shadow of China &apos;s Economic Dominance , published in 2011 .
( the author , now Chief Economic Adviser at India &apos;s finance ministry , and I were colleagues and sometimes co @-@ authors at the International Monetary Fund and the Peterson Institute for International Economics . )
one hopes that the Indian government will heed Subramanian &apos;s account of how China grew through exports of manufactured goods and associated productivity improvements .
China also became integrated into global supply chains - producing things for companies elsewhere - on a previously unimaginable scale , and Chinese managers learned how to make better products .
but other parts of China &apos;s experience have served it less well over time .
China ran a very large current @-@ account surplus during the early 2000s and accumulated a vast stock of foreign reserves - including at least several trillion dollars &quot; worth of US Treasury debt .
although this looks impressive on paper , reserves of this magnitude are essentially useless .
if China were to sell its US assets , the dollar would weaken , and US companies would find it easier to export and to compete against imports .
but Americans &quot; anxiety about being overtaken is not new .
there was great angst in the late 1980s when a Japanese company bought New York City &apos;s Rockefeller Center .
in retrospect , that was one of the great non @-@ events of the twentieth century .
similarly , Americans will most likely look back on China &apos;s accumulation of US government debt and simply shrug .
the bigger issue is China &apos;s exchange @-@ rate policy .
for a long time , China prevented the renminbi from becoming overvalued - and this was good policy , as Subramanian &apos;s research confirms .
but in the early 2000s , China went too far .
for reasons that are still debated , the renminbi became massively undervalued ; exports were much higher than imports , and the current @-@ account surplus reached more than 10 % of GDP .
instead of letting the renminbi appreciate and gradually reducing their reliance on export markets , the Chinese authorities preferred to accumulate foreign reserves ( US Treasury debt ) .
now China has to figure out a way to sustain growth when demand in the rest of the world is sluggish .
a return to a substantially undervalued exchange rate would almost certainly provoke an international response , including from the US Congress .
but switching suddenly to domestic @-@ led growth is not easy .
China will not collapse ( it is not the Soviet Union ) , and Japanese @-@ style stagnation is also unlikely .
but China is aging fast - and could become old before it becomes rich .
every decade , important people predict the end of American power .
and there are reasons to be concerned - particularly when some US politicians refuse to acknowledge the nature of America &apos;s global role .
for example , the US built the world &apos;s trading and monetary system 70 years ago , but now Republicans in Congress refuse to support change at the IMF - including sensible reforms that almost all other countries favor .
still , it is the US that is currently leading the push for freer trade across the Pacific and a substantial reduction in barriers to trade with Europe .
if America gets the rules right - favoring ordinary citizens , rather than footloose corporations - its trade initiatives will make a major contribution to global growth and its own prosperity .
likewise , in terms of monetary policy , the major issue for the world over the next year is when and how much the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates .
as US monetary officials gather for their annual Jackson Hole conclave , they will consider myriad relevant dimensions of the global economy .
but the policy @-@ setting Federal Open Market Committee will move interest rates based almost entirely on its collective read of US economic circumstances .
once again , the rest of the world will react to what the US does .
who &apos;s Afraid of Al Jazeera ?
no one is indifferent to Al Jazeera , the Qatari @-@ based Arab satellite television station .
you can practically see the blood of US officials boil when they discuss it .
to be sure , in the context of the dream of all Arabs being united and independent of foreign control , Al Jazeera is undeniably partial to Arab aspirations .
but that does not make its news reporting untruthful .
in fact , Al Jazeera , which US Secretary of State Colin Powell calls &quot; horrible &quot; and &quot; slanted , &quot; is a pivotal vehicle for reform and change , which genuinely democratic Arab activists and the international community alike have been calling for .
so incensed has America been , however , that it created its own Arabic language mouthpiece in the form of satellite station Al Hurra .
yet Al Hurra is forbidden from broadcasting within the US , because it is state controlled .
Arabs don &apos;t trust it , either .
it demonstrated its lapdog status by never broadcasting images of prisoners being abused inside Baghdad &apos;s notorious Abu Ghraib prison .
in this respect , at least , Al Hurra fits perfectly within the tame tradition of Arab state broadcasters .
America , however , is not alone in challenging Al Jazeera head on .
the BBC , which briefly ran its own Arabic language news station in the mid @-@ 1990 &apos;s - before closing it down because its Saudi funders were unhappy with its reporting - recently announced that it will re @-@ launch an Arabic language news satellite station .
but instead of bashing or seeking to undermine Al Jazeera , politicians should encourage this bastion of free expression , recognizing that Arabs will need to endure a messy process on the way to democracy .
along that tortuous route , the world &apos;s major powers are bound to be offended , probably quite regularly .
television in the Arab world has for years been the mouthpiece used by ruling presidents , kings , and emirs to propagate their official opinions and nothing else .
elite military units usually protect radio and television stations , because they have often been the first targets in military coups .
given this history , and the storm of calls for reform in the Arab world , it is a tragic irony that America and the West have paid so little attention to the terrestrial Arab monopoly television channels .
indeed , US criticism of Al Jazeera sounds more like special pleading because of America &apos;s inept bumbling in Iraq than a genuine desire for free , open , and critical Arab media .
if democracy means giving people a free choice , then there is no doubt that the choice of most Arabs is for a television broadcaster that reflects their aspirations .
in this sense , Al Jazeera is clearly biased , because it is run by Arab patriots and reflects Arab sentiment .
but this is no more a crime than the fact that America &apos;s media reflects American aspirations , and in times of war behaves like a cheerleader for US forces .
the key issue here is whether Al Jazeera , as well as American TV stations , are truthful in what they say .
al Jazeera is certainly professional .
its leading journalists are Western @-@ trained , many having worked for years at the BBC .
in fact , Al Jazeera was founded only after the BBC closed its Arabic language station under Saudi pressure .
al Jazeera &apos;s motto , &quot; opinion and opposing opinion , &quot; has galvanized Arab viewers , because clashing opinions are rarely heard on terrestrial Arab television stations .
of course , when covering the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the US @-@ led war on Iraq , Al Jazeera has not been objective . how could it be ?
but it did not make up facts ; it merely reflected majority Arab opinion .
on such fundamental issues of Arab consensus , it is simply illogical to expect an Arab broadcaster to be even @-@ handed .
moreover , Al Jazeera has not been dumb to complaints about it .
in July , Al Jazeera became the first Arab TV station to create a professional code of ethics .
according to the BBC , the code defines with absolute clarity and transparency how Al @-@ Jazeera journalists are to behave , and sets clear divisions between news , analysis , and commentary .
as for Al Jazeera &apos;s journalistic performance , it is past time that the station be judged by respected professional journalists , not by US or other officials with a policy axe to grind .
a major university department of journalism working with Arab media critics , for example , could provide a much more honest analysis of the station &apos;s work .
if American , British , and other Western officials are serious about reform in the Arab world , they must support reform @-@ minded Arab individuals and organizations , even if those organizations make them uncomfortable at times .
if that becomes the West &apos;s standard , Al Jazeera will rightly be seen as part of the solution , not part of the problem .
who &apos;s dependent Now ?
if the late great Argentine economist Raul Prebisch were alive today , he no doubt would wonder whether the world had turned upside down .
his hugely influential &quot; dependency &quot; theory argued that if poor countries relied too much on commodity exports , they would never achieve the industrial depth needed to sustain rapid growth .
instead , they would become mired in a cycle of declining global commodity prices and ever @-@ dwindling income shares .
Prebisch &apos;s preferred policy response , protectionism , proved disastrous for the many Latin American and African countries that heeded him .
but the fact is that for many years , Prebisch seemed to have made the right call on long @-@ term commodity price trends .
relentless efficiency gains in agriculture and resource extraction pushed down prices for commodities , especially during the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s .
with few exceptions , countries that focused on commodity exports performed dismally , whereas many resource @-@ poor Asian countries raced ahead .
today , however , with Asia &apos;s giants , India and China , joining the global economy , prices for oil , gold , wheat , and virtually every other commodity are exploding .
while there will always be cycles - oil prices , for example , will probably fall before they start rising again - the long @-@ run trend for many commodities will clearly remain upward for some time to come .
what many trade negotiators and other policymakers do not seem to have recognized yet , though Prebisch would have realized it instantly , is that this dramatic turn of events carries huge implications for the global balance of power .
indeed , perhaps no other aspect of economic globalization will pose greater challenges to world leaders over the coming decades .
the questions are many .
are today &apos;s rich countries prepared for an era of co @-@ dependency , in which they are just as desperate for commodities as developing countries are for industrial imports and technology ?
are they prepared for the inevitable flow of power and influence to commodity producers as they become much wealthier ?
how will the world &apos;s two superpowers , China and the United States , come to terms with the fact that important commodity @-@ exporting regions from Africa to the Middle East to Central Asia are littered with ill @-@ formed nation states ?
some self @-@ anointed seers portray the problem as being one of finite natural resources , with the world running out of critical commodities at an alarming rate .
nowadays , there are many adherents of the &quot; Hubbert &apos;s peak &quot; theory of oil production , which holds that we have reached the upper limits of output capacity , the wells are running dry , and it is all downhill from here .
however , as leading oil historian Dan Yergin points out , prophets of doom have declared that the world is running out of oil at least four times already .
each time , radical improvements in technology made the threat evaporate .
in the late 1800 &quot; s , oil extraction involved dredging with a mule .
today , no one thinks anything of drilling 3,000 meters beneath the ocean floor .
there have been similar improvements across the board in metals mining and agriculture .
no , the world is not about to run out of commodities .
instead , what is happening is that the integration of 2.5 billion people ( China and India alone ) into the global economy is producing a demand shift that is likely to put far more upward pressure on commodity prices than any technology gains are likely to offset .
so , for at least the next 50 to 75 years , and perhaps until humans start mining on Mars sometime in the coming centuries , prices for many natural resources are headed up .
will the rebalancing of global economic power that results from this destabilize world politics ?
world War I , of course , was partly set off by Germany &apos;s concern that the other colonial powers had locked up too large a share of world oil and commodity supplies .
similarly , in World War II , Japan feared for the stability of its foreign supplies of oil and other natural resources .
will similar tensions arise between resource @-@ challenged China ( where even water scarcity is a problem ) and the West ?
fortunately , this does not seem likely for the moment , especially given the Chinese leadership &apos;s sober and pragmatic approach to its resource problems .
the Chinese are looking to regions like Africa , hoping to find stable trading partners .
they do not share the political evangelism of the Americans , who don &apos;t just want to trade with commodity exporters , but to convert them as well .
then there are those American leaders who still speak of making the US self @-@ sufficient in energy supplies .
but this is basically a joke : self @-@ indulgent , maybe , but self @-@ sufficient , never .
much of the Arab world understandably views the invasion of Iraq as the cornerstone of the real US strategy for securing stable energy supplies .
if they are right , one can only hope that America has a plan B .
meanwhile , commodity prices will continue to rise , with oil exporters now constituting the largest contributors to America &apos;s gaping trade deficit .
maybe the real US strategy is to try to owe the commodity @-@ exporting countries so much money that they will feel dependent on making America happy !
that is one twist that Prebisch would never have anticipated .
whose Champions , Anyway ?
the links between states and companies have grabbed headlines , most recently in Russia , where President Vladimir Putin seems obsessed with creating &quot; national champions &quot; in the energy and aerospace sectors .
such efforts seem but a part of a surge of protectionism in European political debate about business , especially when it comes to cross @-@ border acquisitions .
across Europe , governments position themselves to be seen as defending &quot; national &quot; players from &quot; foreign &quot; competitors .
&quot; economic patriotism , &quot; the slogan coined by France &apos;s Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin following PepsiCo &apos;s rumored attempt in July 2005 to takeover Danone , perhaps best encapsulates the political imperative .
although de Villepin &apos;s speeches are more flamboyant than those of most political leaders , the underlying sentiment extends far beyond France .
the same impulse appears to be at work behind Italy &apos;s policy on Autostrade , Spain &apos;s on Endesa , Poland &apos;s on its banking sector , the former Swedish Prime Minister &apos;s on Volvo , German unease about &quot; locust &quot; -like funds on Deutsche Börse , or the United Kingdom &apos;s ever louder defense of the London Stock Exchange &apos;s independence from the United States .
the basic belief that underpins &quot; economic patriotism &quot; is that of an alignment of interests between companies considered &quot; national &quot; ( most prominently the largest ones or so @-@ called &quot; champions &quot; ) , their national employees , and the national community .
according to de Villepin , &quot; to defend the employees &quot; interests well , we must protect the interests of our companies . &quot;
he later argued that Danone should be considered &quot; French &quot; because its &quot; milk collection and its water sources are in France . &quot;
but Danone &apos;s own filings indicate that only 22 % of its global sales and less than 14 % of its global workforce are in France .
in fact , the link between European companies and national communities is becoming more tenuous by the day .
research that I carried out for Bruegel surveyed the largest 100 listed companies headquartered in Europe ( ranked by market capitalization ) and analyzed the geographical distribution of their revenue , which is increasingly transparent since the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) last year .
Europe was divided into eight broad zones , comprising individual countries like Germany , France , and Italy , or groupings of smaller countries such as Benelux and the Nordic area .
the survey then calculated the share of revenue earned by each company in the zone in which it is headquartered ( or &quot; home base &quot; ) , the rest of Europe , and the rest of the world .
where relevant information for companies was available , the comparable distribution of employees was also examined .
the results show that the share of the home base in total revenue has become , on average , relatively low : just three @-@ eighths , or 37.5 % , on average for Europe &apos;s largest 100 companies .
of course , this figure covers a wide diversity of industries , and also some geographical differences across the continent .
for example , the averages for German ( 34 % ) or French ( 35 % ) companies are markedly lower than for their Spanish ( 56 % ) or Italian ( 65 % ) counterparts .
but the general trend is unambiguous .
for a broadly representative sub @-@ sample of 55 companies that could be tracked since 1997 , the proportion of revenue generated in the home region has fallen sharply on average , from 50.2 % to 36.9 % .
for these companies , sales to the &quot; rest of Europe , &quot; which represented an average of less than 30 % of total European sales in 1997 , rose above 43 % in 2005 .
if the trend is extrapolated , the home bases of Europe &apos;s largest companies will account , on average , for less than half of their European revenue , and less than a third of their global revenue , before the end of this decade .
these companies are &quot; Europeanizing &quot; fast , and the relative weight of their home base is declining even faster .
moreover , this is not just a story about sales . the survey also measured the geographical distribution of employees relative to the distribution of revenue .
while the distribution profiles between employees and revenue could be sharply dissimilar in some companies , on average they were almost identical : for a sub @-@ sample of 73 companies among Europe &apos;s top 100 , the home base represented 37 % of employees and 35 % of revenue on average in 2005 , while the rest of Europe accounted for 29 % of employees and 28 % of revenue .
this strongly suggests that jobs broadly &quot; follow &quot; sales ( or perhaps the other way round ) , even though , once again , this is true only on average and not for all companies .
what are the implications for policymakers ?
put simply , the numbers show a growing gap of interests between these so @-@ called &quot; champions &quot; and their national home bases .
for Europe &apos;s governments , fostering champions increasingly means providing benefits to non @-@ national customers and employees - a dubious use of taxpayer money .
another consequence is that regulatory competition is likely to increase in Europe , as companies are less bound by local interests to keep their headquarters at &quot; home &quot; if the tax or regulatory environment becomes unfavorable .
the decision by Depfa Bank to shift its headquarters from Wiesbaden to Dublin in 2002 may be a sign of things to come .
the biggest risk is that the growing disconnect between the perception of &quot; national &quot; companies and the reality of Europeanization may lead to spectacularly ill @-@ judged policies .
it is high time for business leaders to be more candid about where their real constituencies lie , and for national politicians to recognize that they can no longer wield control over the giants of today &apos;s European business .
whose Corporate Social Responsibility ?
new YORK - Increasingly , corporations are under pressure , often from activist non @-@ governmental organizations , to take on specific &quot; corporate social responsibility &quot; ( CSR ) obligations .
but the fact that CSR is being demanded , and occasionally conceded , does not ensure clarity about either its rationale or the ways in which it should be undertaken .
CSR can be divided into two categories : what corporations should do ( say , contribute to a women &apos;s rights NGO or build a village school ) and what they should not do ( say , dump mercury into rivers or bury hazardous materials in landfills ) . the latter is wholly conventional and subject to regulation ( and recently to questions about how corporations should behave when there are no host @-@ country regulations ) .
but are CSR obligations really good practice ?
Milton Friedman and other critics often asked if it was the business of businesses to practice corporate altruism .
prior to the rise of the corporation , there were mainly family firms , such as the Rothschilds . when they made money , it accrued principally to the family itself .
altruism , where it existed , also was undertaken by the family , which decided how and on what to spend its money . whether the firm or its shareholders and other stakeholders spent the money was beside the point .
with the rise of the business corporation , large family firms have generally disappeared .
but that does not mean that a corporation is the right entity to engage in altruism - though its various stakeholders obviously can spend any portion of the income they earn from the corporation and other sources in altruistic ways .
instead of CSR , we should have PSR ( personal social responsibility ) .
one can also argue for PSR on the grounds that asking for CSR becomes a way of &quot; passing the buck &quot; - evading personal responsibility for doing good .
this is the flip side of blaming corporations for everything from obesity to scalding from spilled coffee - both the subject of lawsuits in recent years .
there is also an added advantage in replacing CSR with PSR : there is virtue in diversity of approaches to altruism .
Chairman Mao wanted a hundred flowers to bloom , but only so that he could cut them all off at their roots .
but PSR is more like President George H.W. Bush &apos;s metaphor of a &quot; thousand points of light . &quot;
moreover , it is hard to see how a corporation &apos;s stakeholders can always arrive democratically at a common position on how the corporation should engage in social responsibility on their behalf .
each will consider his or her CSR view the best .
but there are strong arguments in favor of CSR as well . first , the political reality is that society treats corporations as if they were persons , which is often also a legal reality for many purposes .
society increasingly demands that these &quot; corporate citizens &quot; be altruistic , just as people are .
given this reality , corporations want to give simply because it is expected of them .
such CSR builds the firm &apos;s image as a &quot; good &quot; corporation , just as giving by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet builds their image as &quot; good &quot; billionaires .
second , many corporations view CSR as an effective defensive strategy against powerful activist NGOs ( such as Greenpeace ) that have taken to using online agitation , boycotts , and other means to &quot; blackmail &quot; targeted corporations into acceding to the activists &quot; demands .
the more CSR a company can point to , the less such efforts will succeed - or even be mounted .
consider the contrasting experiences of Coke and Pepsi .
Coke has been targeted by NGOs for alleged lapses in labor and environmental standards .
by contrast , Pepsi , which once teamed up with AT &amp; T and the CIA to oust President Salvador Allende in Chile , smells like a rose nowadays , because it has distributed CSR largesse to several causes that influential NGOs embrace .
that is a lesson that Wal @-@ Mart has since learned .
in 2005 , the Service Employees &quot; International Union ( SEIU ) created Wal @-@ Mart Watch , with an annual budget of $ 5 million . the purpose was to make Wal @-@ Mart a &quot; better employer , neighbor , and corporate citizen , &quot; and Wal @-@ Mart eventually capitulated on some of the SEIU &apos;s specific demands as well .
finally , CSR can be simply a matter of advertising .
in this case , the choice of CSR spending is focused directly on generating added revenue , much like advertising , and is aimed at sales much the way advertising is .
a benign example is Adidas &apos;s sponsorship of tennis tournaments .
a malign example is Philip Morris &apos;s donation of money to museums , symphony orchestras , and opera houses , cynically aimed at buying off artists who might otherwise work to ban cigarettes .
all these rationales for CSR suggest that it should be left to each corporation to determine , just as PSR leaves altruism to each individual &apos;s conscience and sense of what needs supporting .
the attempt by some NGOs and activists to impose a straitjacket on CSR , reflecting their priorities , is misguided and must be rejected .
instead , the model should be former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan &apos;s initiative , the Global Compact .
what Annan has done is to embrace ten wide @-@ ranging guiding principles while leaving signatory corporations free to choose that which they wish to support actively .
whose Georgia ?
in recent weeks , leaders of various opposition organizations in Georgia , such as Antisoros and Fairness , have been jailed on unfair accusations of plotting a coup on behalf of Russia .
but the wave of political repression merely reflects President Mikhail Saakashvili &apos;s desperate effort to cling to power .
with popular dissent growing and opposition forces strengthening , the authorities have sought to controll non @-@ governmental organizations ( NGOs ) and strengthen the security forces .
but this will only make mass protests inevitable , ultimately jeopardizing the democratic transition in Georgia that Saakashvili claims to represent .
Saakashvili sees a &quot; Moscow hand &quot; in every challenge to his authority , which could be explained by his government &apos;s close alliance with the United States .
but the people rounded up in the latest raid against the opposition were originally imprisoned by Eduard Shevarnadze &apos;s government , which Saakashvili helped depose in Georgia &apos;s supposedly democratic &quot; Rose revolution &quot; in 2003 .
the latest events clearly indicate that a czarist mentality survived the revolution , reflected in a Byzantine model of political power - an emperor and his court - that has as its main vehicle largely unconstrained presidential authority .
before the security forces targeted the opposition bloc that I represent , supporters of educational reforms were prosecuted , while most of the press is under the influence of the government .
Saakashvili claims that the opposition forces that I represent oppose Western values .
but we advocate parliamentarism - genuine separation of executive and legislative power - in Georgia .
and , in supporting the Western model of parliamentariansm , we are on the side of Georgia , not Russia .
it is strange that Saakashvili , a graduate of Columbia Law School , fails to see the disparity between his own democratic rhetoric and autocratic actions .
thus , those of us who value Georgia &apos;s historical ties with Russia are called , at best , &quot; archaists , &quot; and at worst &quot; enemies of Georgian independence , &quot; as if Georgia would become a Russian colony if we ever came to power .
but what separates us from Saakashvili is that we understand that history , geography , and economics dictate close ties to Russia .
we simply see no contradiction between that stance and support for Western values .
indeed , even Russia , with all its imperfections , cannot be said to oppose Western values .
the unfortunate paradox in Georgia - and elsewhere in the post @-@ Soviet world - is that self @-@ serving pro @-@ Western rhetoric has often led democratic values to be sacrificed in favor of a new dictatorship .
when the West actively supports popular revolutions , as in Georgia and Ukraine , the newly established power relies on democratic slogans , not democratic behavior .
Shevardnadze , too , was initially viewed as a symbol of post @-@ Soviet Georgian democracy .
as a government minister in 1993 , however , I was already hearing CIA officials express concern that a &quot; Mafia state &quot; was being created instead .
first with Shevarnadze , and now with Saakashvili , popular disillusionment reflects not rejection of democracy , but frustration with its continuing absence .
Saakashvili is evidently mesmerized by the US , and the West in general , but what is the point if there is no independent and democratic political process in Georgia today ?
and why , then , is sustaining close ties to the US so desirable , while refusing to dismiss Russia as a partner is regarded as being an agent of the Kremlin ?
is the US , in contrast to Russia , by definition honest , innocent , and high @-@ minded ?
there should be no place for such unfortunate double standards .
regardless of what the Saakashvili government claims about his opponents , our political orientation is not pro @-@ Russian , but pro @-@ Georgian .
we believe that Georgia should pursue its own interests , which it may share with Europe , Russia , or the US , but which are nonetheless our own .
we have no interest in merely executing US policy , or in basing Georgia &apos;s foreign and domestic policy solely on distancing the country from Russia , as Saakashvili has done .
thus , pro @-@ Georgian politics should not countenance nationalism .
nowadays , some of our politicians have embraced the slogan &quot; Georgia for Georgians . &quot;
but nationalism suggests the lack of a coherent conception of Georgia &apos;s interests .
Georgia &apos;s tradition as a multinational , tolerant state , which has been weakened in the last 15 years , must be reinvigorated , because we have no need for enemies against which to define ourselves .
a strong relationship with Russia need not come at the expense of relations with America and the West , and vice versa .
Georgia should be neither pro @-@ Russian nor pro @-@ American .
it is a small , poor country that desperately needs stability and economic development .
its model should not be Palestine and permanent battle , but Switzerland and permanent prosperity .
whose War on Terror ?
&quot; we are all Americans , &quot; wrote Le Monde on September 12 , 2001 . and so it was with most people in the Muslim world , who were as appalled as anyone else at the carnage of the terrorist attacks on Washington and New York .
indeed , when America responded to the attacks , almost no one mourned the fall of the Taliban , who were universally condemned for their fanaticism .
this unanimity of opinion no longer exists .
in the five years since the attacks , two audiences for the so @-@ called &quot; war on terror &quot; have emerged .
indeed , as the &quot; war &quot; progressed , the audience closest to the action began to see the emerging combat in a way that was diametrically opposed to that of the United States and the West .
to the US administration , every act in the drama of the war on terror was seen as discrete and self @-@ contained : Afghanistan , Iraq , Palestine , and Hezbollah in Lebanon .
the Bush administration , having proclaimed a war on terror , invaded and occupied countries , and yet failed to see that these events were being linked in the eyes of people in the region .
glued to Al Jazeera and other Arab satellite channels , the various battles of the &quot; war on terror &quot; came to be viewed as a single chain of events in a grand plot against Islam .
worse yet , America waved the banner of democracy as it prosecuted its wars . but hopes for democracy , be it secular or Islamist , for the people concerned have been buried in the rubble and carnage of Baghdad , Beirut , and Kandahar .
many Muslims understand - as well as anyone in the West , and in the same terms - the underlying causes of the alienation that animates Islamic radicalism and violence . they know that the rigid dictatorships of the region have paralyzed their populations . only those consumed by the fires of their rage seem able to melt the shackles of these authoritarian societies .
but the price of escape is a kind of deformation .
embittered , fanatical , vengeful : those who rebel against the status quo enter the wider world seeking retaliation , not just against the regimes that deformed them , but against the West , which propped up the region &apos;s authoritarians in the interest of &quot; stability . &quot;
many Muslims also understand that the problem of Palestine , unsolved for three generations , goes beyond the suffering of the Palestinian people . they know that the region &apos;s dictators have used Palestine to justify their misrule and to avoid political and economic liberalization .
so when America called for democracy , the hearts of many in the region soared with the hope that reform would come at last . but America , as so many times before , let them down .
as people at last began to hope for more liberal and decent societies , the US continued to endorse the regimes that were repressing them . America simply could not adhere to its own democracy @-@ promotion script .
after the ouster of the Taliban in Afghanistan , the US turned its sights on the secular dictatorship of Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq . instead of encouraging reform of the Saudi / Wahhabi regime - the system that spawned 15 of the 19 hijackers in the 9 / 11 attacks - the average Muslim saw America as waging war on a regime that had nothing to do with that crime .
many Muslims acquiesced in this deviation , viewing the invasion of Iraq as part of the passing of dictatorship and the coming of democracy . but the bloodstained shambles of the US occupation led America to abandon the quest for democracy .
the deeper America sank into the Iraqi quagmire , the more the US began to turn a blind eye to the region &apos;s surviving dictators , particularly those in Saudi Arabia , Syria , Egypt , and Pakistan .
indeed , the last thing the region &apos;s dictators wanted to see was a democratic Iraq .
almost from the moment of Saddam &apos;s fall , Saudi / Wahhabi jihadis poured into Iraq almost unimpeded .
worse yet , the Muslims who supported the project to democratize Iraq widely suspect that the Sunni resistance that incited the Iraqi civil war has been financed by Saudi oil money . ( terrorism also kept Iraqi oil from becoming a serious challenger to Saudi Arabia . )
so the effort to democratize Iraq - indeed , the entire American project to democratize the region - has fallen under deep suspicion by even the most moderate of Muslims .
America , they believe , only wants a democracy that suits its interests .
if Palestinians freely vote for Hamas , their choice is actively opposed .
Lebanon &apos;s &quot; Cedar Revolution , &quot; which galvanized the West in the same way as Ukraine &apos;s Orange Revolution , has been systematically undermined .
with democracy in most of the region still a long way off - indeed , perhaps a more distant prospect now than five years ago - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice repeats her mantra that the dead civilians of Beirut , Sidon , Tyre , and Gaza represent the &quot; birth pangs &quot; of a new Middle East .
but until the West stops regarding dead babies as political props , we cannot understand how the Muslim world perceives all that has happened since September 11 , 2001 .
only then will we understand why the unified view of five years ago has fractured so violently .
whose World Bank ?
new YORK - US President Barack Obama &apos;s nomination of Jim Yong Kim for the presidency of the World Bank has been well received - and rightly so , especially given some of the other names that were bandied about .
in Kim , a public @-@ health professor who is now President of Dartmouth College and previously led the World Health Organization &apos;s HIV / AIDS department , the United States has put forward a good candidate .
but the candidate &apos;s nationality , and the nominating country - whether small and poor or large and rich - should play no role in determining who gets the job .
the World Bank &apos;s 11 executive directors from emerging and developing countries have put forward two excellent candidates , Ngozi Okonjo @-@ Iweala of Nigeria and Jose Antonio Ocampo of Colombia .
I have worked closely with both of them .
both are first @-@ rate , have served as ministers with multiple portfolios , have performed admirably in top positions in multilateral organizations , and have the diplomatic skills and professional competence to do an outstanding job .
they understand finance and economics , the bread and butter of the World Bank , and have a network of connections to leverage the Bank &apos;s effectiveness .
Okonjo @-@ Iweala brings an insider &apos;s knowledge of the institution .
Ocampo , like Kim , brings the advantages and disadvantages of being an outsider ; but Ocampo , a distinguished professor at Columbia University , is thoroughly acquainted with the World Bank .
he previously served not only as minister of economics and finance , but also of agriculture - a critically important qualification , given that the vast majority of the developing countries &quot; poor depend on farming .
he also brings impressive environmental credentials , addressing another of the Bank &apos;s central concerns .
both Okonjo @-@ Iweala and Ocampo understand the role of international financial institutions in providing global public goods .
throughout their careers , their hearts and minds have been devoted to development , and to fulfilling the World Bank &apos;s mission of eliminating poverty .
they have set a high bar for any American candidate .
much is at stake .
almost two billion people remain in poverty in the developing world , and , while the World Bank cannot solve the problem on its own , it plays a leading role .
despite its name , the Bank is primarily an international development institution .
Kim &apos;s specialty , public health , is critical , and the Bank has long supported innovative initiatives in this field .
but health is only a small part of the Bank &apos;s &quot; portfolio , &quot; and it typically works in this area with partners who bring to the table expertise in medicine .
rumors suggest that the US is likely to insist on maintaining the perverse selection process in which it gets to pick the World Bank &apos;s president , simply because , in this election year , Obama &apos;s opponents would trumpet loss of control over the choice as a sign of weakness .
and it is more important for the US to retain that control than it is for emerging and developing countries to obtain it .
indeed , the more powerful of the emerging markets know how to live within the current system , and they may use it to their advantage .
they will , in effect , obtain an IOU , to be cashed in for something that is more important .
the Realpolitik of the moment makes fighting over the presidency unlikely ; America may well prevail .
but at what cost ?
should America continue to insist on controlling the selection process , it is the Bank itself that would suffer .
for years , the Bank &apos;s effectiveness was compromised because it was seen , in part , as a tool of Western governments and their countries &quot; financial and corporate sectors .
ironically , even America &apos;s long @-@ term interests would be best served by a commitment - not just in words , but also in deeds - to a merit @-@ based system and good governance .
one supposed achievement of the G @-@ 20 was an agreement to reform the governance of the international financial institutions - most importantly , how their leaders are selected .
since expertise on development by and large lies within the emerging and developing countries - after all , they live development - it seems natural that the World Bank &apos;s head would come from one of those countries .
to maintain a cabal among developed countries , whereby the US appoints the World Bank president and Europe picks the International Monetary Fund &apos;s head , seems particularly anachronistic and perplexing today , when the Bank and the Fund are turning to emerging @-@ market countries as a source of funds .
while the US , the international community , and the Bank itself repeatedly emphasize the importance of good governance , a selection procedure that de facto leaves the appointment to the US president makes a mockery of it .
Okonjo @-@ Iweala put the matter forcefully in an interview with the Financial Times : what is at stake is a matter of hypocrisy .
the integrity of the advanced industrial countries , which have a majority of the votes at the World Bank , is being put to the test .
who Should Be helped First ?
the list of urgent challenges facing humanity is depressingly long .
AIDS , hunger , armed conflict , and global warming compete for attention alongside government failure , malaria , and the latest natural disaster .
while our compassion is great , our resources are limited .
so who should be helped first ?
to some , making such priorities seems obscene .
but the United Nations and national governments spend billions of dollars each year trying to help those in need without explicitly considering whether they are achieving the most that they can .
the western media focuses on a tsunami in Asia ; donations flow freely .
an earthquake that devastates Pakistan garners fewer headlines , so the developed world gives a lot less .
there is a better way .
we could prioritize our spending to achieve the greatest benefit for our money .
this month , I will ask UN ambassadors how they would spend $ 50 billion to reduce suffering .
they will repeat the same exercise that some of the world &apos;s best economists tackled in a 2004 project called the &quot; Copenhagen Consensus &quot; : weighing up solutions to the great challenges facing the world , and deciding what should be done first .
but the question shouldn &apos;t be left to politicians or Nobel laureates alone .
we must all engage in the debate .
one hopes that this task has been made slightly simpler by the publication of a book in which the Copenhagen Consensus economists boil down their insights .
here &apos;s one fact to consider : the entire death toll from the Southeast Asian tsunami is matched each month by the number of worldwide casualties of HIV / AIDS .
a comprehensive prevention program providing free or cheap condoms and information about safe sex to the regions worst affected by HIV / AIDS would cost $ 27 billion and save more than 28 million lives .
this , say the economists who took part in the Copenhagen Consensus , makes it the single best investment that the world could possibly make .
the social benefits would outweigh the costs by 40 to one .
other options that the economists favored spending some of their $ 50 billion include providing micro @-@ nutrients to the world &apos;s hungry , establishing free trade , and battling malaria with mosquito nets and medication .
at the other end of the scale , responses to climate change like the Kyoto Protocol would cost more than they would achieve , so the economists crossed them off the list of things to do right now .
regardless of whether we agree with the economists , everybody must admit that we cannot do everything at once .
discussing our priorities is crucial .
often , politicians avoid prioritization .
why ?
the glib answer is because it is hard .
there are many interested parties .
no group wants their solution to come last , and no government wants its country &apos;s national challenges to be overlooked .
the UN conference won &apos;t be easy .
but it shows that there is a will to put prioritization squarely at the center of attention .
it will produce a &quot; to do &quot; list that will demonstrate how to achieve the most that we can for humanity , which could lead , in turn , to more transparent decision @-@ making .
the principles of economics provide a sound basis on which to make rational choices .
now , the discussion needs to shift from the academic sphere to political life .
it &apos;s time for all of us to consider and compare our own priority lists .
we must endeavor to shorten the list of challenges facing humanity .
but that requires all of us to engage in a debate about what we need to do first .
who Should Lead the IMF ?
Berkeley - The International Monetary Fund , many say , has had a good crisis .
as recently as three years ago , many observers thought that the Fund had outlived its usefulness and should be closed down .
since then , it has intervened in Hungary , Latvia , Iceland , and Ukraine , among other crisis @-@ stricken countries - and has received a massive infusion of new resources .
part of the explanation for the higher esteem in which the IMF is now held is its recent display of intellectual flexibility - a rare virtue for a big , lumbering bureaucracy .
it has rethought its traditional opposition to capital controls .
it has suggested that central banks may want to consider higher inflation targets in order to avoid hitting the zero bound in the event of deflationary shocks . for this , it drew a stern reproach from Germany &apos;s Bundesbank - a clear sign that it is doing something right .
the IMF has also put in place a Flexible Credit Line to disburse funds quickly - and free of onerous conditions - to countries buffeted by financial crosswinds through no fault of their own .
the problem is that , despite its alluring name , the new facility has had few takers , and no Asian takers in particular .
indeed , it is revealing that when South Korea was desperate for dollars following the failure of Lehman Brothers , it borrowed from the United States Federal Reserve , not from the Fund .
after their experience in 1997 @-@ 1998 , Korean policymakers would sooner jump off a cliff than borrow , even without conditions , from the IMF .
nevertheless , while not all is sweetness and light , there has been progress .
and for this the IMF &apos;s strong , politically astute management - not exactly something from which the Fund has regularly benefited in recent years - deserves credit .
now , however , the rumor mill is heating up with gossip that the Fund &apos;s managing director , Dominique Strauss @-@ Kahn , will leave in order to oppose Nikolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential elections .
Sarkozy &apos;s popularity is hitting new lows , and Strauss @-@ Kahn &apos;s friends say that he has never made a secret of his political ambitions .
a lame @-@ duck managing director would hamstring the Fund .
already there is a sense that the IMF is reluctant to tell Europe more forcefully how to handle its problem with Greece because the managing director must be careful to avoid meddling in Europe &apos;s internal politics .
on top of this now comes the interesting news that the IMF has appointed Zhu Min , previously a deputy governor of the People &apos;s Bank of China , as special adviser to Strauss @-@ Kahn .
Zhu will thus be part of the core management team .
this , in turn , has fueled speculation that Zhu will be a candidate to become the next managing director .
it is the turn of someone from outside Europe to head the IMF - Europe having had a monopoly on the position since the Fund was created following World War II .
the bargain then was that the US could pick the president of the World Bank while the Europeans would get the top slot at the IMF ( US policymakers in their wisdom believing that the Bank would become the more important institution ) .
but today &apos;s world is more multi @-@ polar . it is no longer dominated by the Atlantic economies , so those economies should no longer dictate who holds the top jobs at the two Bretton Woods institutions .
it is now , the argument goes , another region &apos;s turn .
the obvious choice is Asia , home to the most dynamic emerging markets .
it is the region to which the world &apos;s economic center of gravity is shifting .
if you ask Asian leaders what would make them consider again approaching the Fund after their traumatic experience with IMF &quot; assistance &quot; in 1997 @-@ 1998 , they will answer : an Asian managing director .
in fact , this is precisely the wrong way to think about the problem .
the IMF &apos;s problem in the past has been parochialism and lack of accountability .
the best way to ensure that the Fund remains open to new ideas is by selecting the person with the best ideas to lead it .
the best way to ensure that the IMF &apos;s management is accountable to all of its governmental shareholders is to prevent the top job from becoming the sinecure of any region , whether Europe or Asia .
the next managing director should be selected on the merits , not on the basis of nationality .
there should be an open competition , in which the best candidate wins on the basis of his or her ideas .
Asia has plenty of competent economic officials who might be considered as the next managing director of the IMF . but just because they are Asian is not reason enough to select them .
Prepping Gay Men for PrEP
London - In October , two groups researching the effectiveness of a potential breakthrough drug in the fight against HIV did something unusual .
they announced that the therapy they were testing , an antiretroviral drug called Truvada , had proved effective enough to end the randomized phases of the trials , and that they were offering the pill to all of the studies &quot; participants .
the researchers found that gay men who take Truvada , in addition to using condoms when they have sex , were significantly less likely to contract HIV .
this is further evidence of the effectiveness of pre @-@ exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , a technique by which people who are HIV @-@ negative use antiretroviral drugs to protect themselves from infection .
in 2011 , a trial funded by the Gates Foundation found that straight couples using Truvada reduced the risk of transmitting HIV by 73 % .
those fighting to prevent the spread of HIV / AIDS thus have a new tool in their arsenal .
the question now is how best to deliver it to those who need it most : gay men in developing countries .
this summer , the World Health Organization took an important step to that end , recommending PrEP for all gay men and men who have sex with men , making it the first major international health organization to do so .
the WHO estimates that increased use of PrEP could reduce HIV infections by up to 25 % over the next decade among men who have sex with men ( this category includes anyone with elevated risk , not just those who identify as gay ) .
but an important obstacle remains : the legal predicament of gay men in much of the developing world .
in countries like Nigeria , where anti @-@ homosexuality legislation has recently been approved , those following the WHO &apos;s new PrEP guidelines could find themselves subject to imprisonment .
the climate of officially sanctioned homophobia in Nigeria has already set back the fight against AIDS .
in 2006 , a study found that 13 % of men who have sex with men in Nigeria were HIV @-@ positive , compared to 4.5 % of all Nigerians .
by 2012 , the HIV rate among men who have sex with men had jumped to 17 % .
meanwhile , an increasing number of men reported encountering homophobia at healthcare centers , making them less likely to seek help .
the consequences could not be more serious .
two years ago , a young HIV @-@ positive Nigerian man contacted me on Facebook to tell me about his monthly ordeal at the clinic .
the nurse at the hospital spent more time lecturing him on the evils of homosexuality than telling him about the drugs he was taking and their possible side effects .
the man , a third @-@ year medical student , told me that he had decided to stop going to the clinic .
when I asked how he would continue treatment , he said that he had a friend abroad who could get him the drugs .
less than two years later , I saw a Facebook update announcing his death .
my Facebook friend is not the only one who has paid the price for Nigeria &apos;s homophobia .
a preliminary report from the Solidarity Alliance Nigeria , a coalition of gay , lesbian , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) organizations , details a huge decrease in the use of HIV services by men who have sex with men in the six months following the enactment of the anti @-@ gay legislation .
the decrease ranges from 40 % in Lagos - Nigeria &apos;s most cosmopolitan city - to 70 % in Kano , a predominantly Muslim state .
Nigerians living with HIV must do more than just fight the infection ; they also must brave social stigma , weather discrimination by secular and religious institutions , and now , potentially , face threats from the legal system .
in this environment , the promise of PrEP begins to dim , as the risks of seeking treatment outweigh the potentially life @-@ saving benefits .
the story is similar in Uganda .
last spring , as legal persecution of gays there mounted , the government raided an HIV clinic and withheld its operating license for providing care and support to HIV @-@ positive men who have sex with men .
as an African activist with more than ten years of experience in the fight against HIV , I hope that the WHO will build on its important first step of advising the use of PrEP .
that means initiating a public conversation with countries like Nigeria , Uganda , Gambia , and Russia on the importance of inclusion in the battle against HIV .
the WHO should make it clear that while it may not be advocating for LGBT political rights , it is determined to ensure that all those who can benefit from PrEP are able to access the necessary drugs , without fear of legal consequences .
researchers , drug companies , and human @-@ rights campaigners must take up the fight to ensure that PrEP is made available - without risk - to those who need it most .
who &apos;s Who on Putin &apos;s payroll ?
Moscow - Germany &apos;s ex @-@ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is a legend in Russia .
he serves Gazprom &apos;s interests for a measly couple of million euros a year , sits in at sessions of the Russian Academy of Sciences , and writes books about his staunch friendship with &quot; Genosse Wladimir , &quot; who , in the not @-@ so @-@ distant past , earned himself the well @-@ deserved nickname of &quot; Stasi &quot; among business circles in gangster @-@ ridden St. Petersburg .
but it is not immediately obvious whether it is Schroeder licking Putin &apos;s boots nowadays or vice versa .
the two of them are building , or trying to build , the Nord Stream gas pipeline , an exceptionally costly project that satisfies twin strategic objectives .
Demonstratively hostile to the interests of both Belarus and Ukraine , the pipeline is intended to ensure that these countries are under Russia &apos;s energy thumb , regardless of who is in power in Minsk and Kiev .
as a bonus , the pipeline will also consolidate the Russian economy &apos;s status as an appendage of Germany &apos;s - its supplier of natural resources .
certain of Schroeder &apos;s predecessors as German chancellor sought to attain the same objective by rather different means .
the Kremlin &apos;s achievements in securing the help of Americans willing to offer their influence are equally impressive .
indeed , the Obama administration &apos;s Russia policy is being nurtured with advice from people who have no official position in the administration but close business ties to Russia and the Kremlin : Henry Kissinger , James A. Baker , Thomas Graham , and Dimitri Simes .
the first two are major geo @-@ politicians ; Graham and Simes are respected as outstanding Russia specialists .
they write key reports for the administration , and shuttle between Moscow and Washington , coordinating the parameters of the Obama administration &apos;s effort to &quot; reset &quot; the bilateral relationship .
like Schroeder , all these people are not economically disinterested .
Baker is a consultant for the two companies at the commanding heights of the Russian economy , Gazprom and Rosneft .
the Kissinger Associates lobbying group , whose Russian section is headed by Graham , feeds in to the Kissinger @-@ Primakov working group , a quasi @-@ private @-@ sector effort , blessed by Putin , to deepen ties between Russia and the United States .
it is highly instructive to read the recommendations of these people and groups , as they unobtrusively render the objectives of their Kremlin clients into a language familiar to American leaders .
Graham &apos;s latest contribution , &quot; Resurgent Russia and US Purposes , &quot; is most revealing in this respect .
the author finds the government of a &quot; Russia getting up off its knees &quot; to consist of progressive modernizers fully aware of the challenges facing their country as it attempts to &quot; return to the great powers club . &quot;
&quot; in order to become a genuinely developed and modern country , &quot; Graham continues , &quot; in the coming decade Russia will need to invest at least one trillion dollars in modernizing its infrastructure .
America and the West in general have a vital interest in seeing the modernization of Russia succeed .
the lion &apos;s share of the technologies , know @-@ how , and a substantial proportion of the investment , needs to come from Europe and the USA . &quot;
in addition to the technology and investments , Graham quietly slips in a foreign policy suggestion for the Obama administration that is sure to please the Kremlin : &quot; Finlandizing &quot; Ukraine .
unless that sort of appeasement is pursued , he warns , Russia will continue to oppose the US &quot; wherever and whenever it can . &quot;
according to Graham , &quot; At the extreme , a weak Russia , with its vast resources and sparse population east of the Urals , could become the object of competition among the great powers , notably China and the United States . &quot;
that unspoken help @-@ us @-@ develop @-@ or @-@ we &apos;ll @-@ let @-@ the @-@ Chinese @-@ do @-@ it threat is a logical development of Prime Minister Putin &apos;s homily at this year &apos;s World Economic Forum in Davos , where he advocated decisive action to end the world economic crisis .
his recipe ?
Western countries should write off half a trillion dollars &quot; worth of debt owed to them by the Russian state corporations run by his pals from the Dresden KGB and the Ozero dacha cooperative .
but no amount of money will succeed in modernizing Putin &apos;s kleptocratic regime , which has already squandered trillions in oil wealth .
simply put , the Putin system is politically , institutionally , and intellectually antithetical to the task of modernization .
Graham &apos;s only error in his presentation is his attempt to frighten the administration with a hypothetical confrontation between the US and China over Russian resources .
this is not his area of specialization .
Kissinger works personally with the Chinese account , jointly propounding with his long @-@ time rival Zbigniew Brzezinski the notion , so seductive for an America growing weary of its imperial burden , of a global Big Two .
here is a recent sample of Kissinger &apos;s geopolitical arts : &quot; the role of China in a new world order is crucial .
a relationship that started on both sides as essentially a strategic design to constrain a common adversary has evolved over the decades into a pillar of the international system ... The Sino @-@ American relationship needs to be taken to a new level .
this generation of leaders has the opportunity to shape relations into a design for a common destiny , much as was done with trans @-@ Atlantic relations in the post @-@ war period . &quot;
no doubt Kissinger believes every word he wrote , but his ideas also honestly articulate the aspirations of his customers .
it &apos;s just that not all customers have the same motives .
one wants to get his hooks into a further trillion dollars that it can pick away at , while the other wants to become &quot; a central construct of the system of international relations . &quot;
but , in both cases , the customers are getting the influence for which they are paying .
who Wants Peace in the Middle East ?
Forty years after the Six Day War peace between Israelis and Palestinians seems as distant as ever .
Israel still refuses to accept the new Palestinian national unity government as a negotiating partner because Hamas is part of that government .
what is the cause of this seeming paradox ?
is there any hope ?
the Palestinian government is united administratively , but divided politically .
the Palestinians have one government with two policies .
politically , Palestine &apos;s Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh remains against recognizing Israel and respecting the existing agreements .
he declared that he is for the continuation of resistance in all forms .
what kind of guarantee of a good faith effort to reach a peace agreement can come from such a stance ?
that is the question the European Union needs to ask itself as it debates whether to resume providing financial aid to the Palestinian Authority .
the EU should make it clear to Hamas that the Union is not going to finance terror and is not going to finance a refusal to make peace .
if the Palestinians want to have European help - which I support completely - it must be ready to make peace , not to break peace .
after all , it is not Hamas as a party that is objectionable ; what is objectionable are the politics and policies which Hamas pursues .
we have nothing against Hamas ; we are against their belligerent policies , which service in government has not changed .
there was a time when the PLO held positions that were the same as those of Hamas .
then the PLO changed .
if the current Palestinian leadership changes its position , there will be no problem from our side .
we will have nothing against negotiations . we are for negotiations .
we are for the &quot; two @-@ state solution . &quot;
we accept the Middle East &quot; road map . &quot;
what we are against is terror .
where we cannot agree , however , is on a &quot; right of return &quot; for Palestinians .
if such a right were recognized , there would be a Palestinian majority instead of a Jewish majority , which would mean the end of the Jewish state .
this is a demographic , not a religious , question : an Arab state is where the Arabs are the majority , and the Jewish state is where the Jews are the majority .
indeed , the &quot; right of return &quot; contradicts the very idea of a two @-@ state solution , as it would mean one state - a Palestinian state .
nobody in Israel will accept this .
but there are other problems in the region that Israel - and the world - must face .
the Palestinians &quot; current unity government resulted from Saudi mediation , which came in response mainly to Iran &apos;s ambition to increase its influence , not only in Iraq , but also in Lebanon , Gaza , and the West Bank .
of course , that issue is completely outside Israel &apos;s control .
the ongoing fight in the Muslim world between Sunnis and Shi &apos;a recalls the struggle between Protestants and Catholics in seventeenth @-@ century Europe .
so it is little wonder that the Saudis , Jordanians , Egyptians , and the Gulf states are seeking to resist Iran &apos;s hegemonic ambitions in the region .
nevertheless , the stakes are far higher than in the seventeenth century , because Iran represents a threat that combines a fanatic religion with a determination to acquire nuclear weapons .
indeed , Iran is the only country that openly declares its desire to destroy another member of the United Nations .
that is a threat that every country is obliged to take seriously .
when a country &apos;s president delivers crazy speeches , denies the Holocaust , and does not hide his ambition to control the Middle East , who can guarantee that the threat is not serious ?
the issue is not one of restoring nuclear &quot; balance &quot; to the Middle East , as Iran &apos;s leaders maintain .
first of all , Israel does not threaten anybody .
Israel never said that it wants to destroy Iran ; Israel never openly proclaimed that it would enrich uranium and build nuclear bombs in order to destroy another country .
on the contrary , Israel has said that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the Middle East .
but that does not mean that we can afford to ignore an obvious threat from countries that want to destroy us .
despite the current unfavorable situation , the path to stabilizing the Middle East still leads through joint economic projects .
even now , Israel is planning to build a new &quot; corridor of peace , &quot; which will comprise the Jordanians , the Palestinians , and us .
within the framework of this project , we are seeking to halt the dehydration of the Dead Sea , build a joint airport and a joint water network with Jordan , and develop tourism infrastructure , at a cost of up to $ 5 billion .
we have the donors , so there is no shortage of money to finance our efforts , which , I am sure , will be realized .
Israel wants - indeed , desperately needs - peace and stability in the Middle East , and we will continue to do everything in our power to achieve it .
but we cannot reach that goal alone , much less negotiate with those whose idea of a stable and peaceful Middle East is one that has no place for Israel .
who Will Eclipse America ?
Washington , DC - According to Voltaire , the Roman Empire fell &quot; because all things fall . &quot;
it is hard to argue with this as a general statement about decline : nothing lasts forever . but it is also not very useful .
in thinking , for example , about American predominance in the world today , it would be nice to know when it will decline , and whether the United States can do anything to postpone the inevitable .
contemporary commenters despaired of the Roman Empire for several hundred years before it finally collapsed .
could America find its way to a similar extension ?
in terms of providing an essential structure for discussion of this problem , Arvind Subramanian &apos;s new book , Eclipse : living in the Shadow of China &apos;s Economic Dominance , is a major contribution .
( full disclosure : Subramanian and I are colleagues at the Peterson Institute for International Economics , and we have worked together on other issues . )
in particular , Subramanian develops an index of economic dominance that should become a focus of conversation anywhere that people want to think about changes in world economic leadership .
there is no need to know any economics in order to be fascinated by this book : it is about power , pure and simple .
the basic facts are incontrovertible .
the United Kingdom was the world &apos;s dominant economic power from the rise of industrialization in the early nineteenth century . but it lost its predominance and was gradually eclipsed by the US , which , at least since 1945 , has been the undisputed leader among market @-@ based economies .
the US surpassed the UK in terms of industrial production as early as the end of the nineteenth century , but that was not enough to tip the balance .
economic predominance shifted only when the UK ran large current @-@ account deficits during World Wars I and II - the country had to borrow heavily in order to finance its war effort , and imports were significantly higher than exports .
much of the world &apos;s gold reserves ended up in the hands of the US .
this helped undermine the role of the British pound internationally and catapulted the US dollar to the fore - particularly after the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 , at which it was agreed that countries would hold their reserves in dollars as well as gold .
more recently , however , it has been the Americans &quot; turn consistently to run large current @-@ account deficits , buying more from the rest of the world than they earn by selling goods and services abroad .
on this dimension , the US seems destined to repeat the mistake of the British .
at the same time , emerging @-@ market countries &quot; per capita income has risen - as has their international role .
in particular , China has followed a strategy in the past decade or so that entails running large current @-@ account surpluses and building up foreign @-@ exchange reserves , which are now reported to be in excess of $ 3 trillion .
indeed , Subramanian &apos;s most provocative argument is that China has already surpassed the US in terms of economic dominance - but we have not yet woken up to this new reality .
the story is fascinating and well told ; but there is still a great deal worth arguing .
for example , did the British decline because the US could not be stopped , or because of problems within the British Empire and at home ?
a few years ago , some regarded Japan as having overtaken the US . Europe also was supposedly vying for global economic dominance .
now any such claims would seem preposterous .
in both cases , the credit system got out of control , with too much lending to the private sector in 1980 &quot; s Japan and excessive government borrowing during the 2000 &quot; s in the eurozone .
similarly , it remains unclear that the Chinese development path will remain smooth .
fixed investment in China is close to 50 % of GDP - which must be a world record .
credit to state firms and to households continues to grow rapidly .
isn &apos;t this a version of exactly what derailed Japanese growth ?
on the key issue of being able to issue a &quot; reserve currency &quot; that investors and governments want to hold , Subramanian is correct that China has many of the prerequisites in place .
but it still lacks some key elements , including fully @-@ fledged property rights .
if you worry about getting your money out of a country when times turn tough , China is not an attractive place to hold your reserves .
external challenges do sometimes bring down states .
but , more frequently , the big problems are internal - the regime cannot deliver growth , its legitimacy fades , and people start to head for the exits ( or at least get their money out ) .
if the US is eclipsed any time soon , this will more likely be due to its loss of social cohesion and its dysfunctional politics .
China might well step in to fill that vacuum , but that is quite different from being able to elbow America aside .
who Will Help the Poor ?
Paris - With the deepening of the economic crisis and the prospect of another recession looming large on the horizon , growing social inequality has become an increasingly urgent issue .
how does one reinforce a sense of solidarity and responsibility within a country ?
who will protect the weakest ?
as I ponder this issue , I am reminded of a debate that I had more than ten years ago in Berlin with the German theologian Hans Küng and American and Asian participants .
the subject was &quot; Globalization and Ethics &quot; - specifically , a comparison of the ways that Europe , the United States and Asia protect the most fragile members of their respective societies .
all of the participants agreed that in Europe the state traditionally filled the role played by private philantropy in the US and by the family in Asia .
but we all hastened to add that no model was &quot; pure , &quot; i.e. , the family was no longer what it used to be in Asia , the state was playing a bigger role than expected in America , and it was often underperforming in Europe .
reality has become even more complicated since then : the family &apos;s role continues to decline in Asia ; philantropy , despite a few extraordinarily generous individuals , has more than met its limits in America ; and , with the possible exception of the Nordic countries , the state in Europe , overburdened by debt , no longer has the means or the will to shoulder new responsibilities .
so who will take on the responsibility to protect the weakest if none of these three actors can do it properly ?
are we heading toward a world united by shared incompetence and inadequacy ?
in the Western world , the poorest are the worst affected by economic stagnation .
but , in rapidly growing emerging @-@ market countries , the rich tend to close their eyes to the suffering of the poorest , except when they feel threatened by the risk of political upheaval , as in , say , Saudi Arabia .
in fact , wealthy elites in emerging countries live in a state of denial towards their poor , literally ignoring them .
Brazil and India are particularly striking in this regard .
economic growth is necessary , but not sufficient : a strong sense of social responsibility is needed as well .
it would be absurd to condemn , as some do , globalization as the main and only culprit in the erosion of traditional sources of support for the poor .
globalization is above all a context , an environment , even if the consequences of the first major financial and economic crisis of the global age will further deepen the gap between the very rich and the very poor .
but globalization makes the weakest among us more visible , and therefore makes the absence of social justice more unacceptable .
a world of much greater transparency and interdependency creates new responsibilities for the rich .
or , more precisely , it makes the old responsibility to protect the weakest both more difficult and more urgent .
in a world of increasing complexity , perhaps what is needed are simple solutions .
one could follow , for example , Adam Smith &apos;s principle of comparative advantage : what Europe does best is the state , while Asia still relies on the family and the US continues to focus on individual initiative .
the problem is that in a world of universal benchmarking , the legitimacy of solutions will stem more than ever from their cultural acceptability and their efficiency .
in Western Europe , for example , the call for sacrifice from all citizens in order to resolve the debt crisis runs up against a lingering perception that not all will contribute equally , and that social inequality will be exacerbated by austerity .
restoring growth in the short term while addressing debt problems in the medium and long term may well be the only valid response to the crisis .
but it will not work , in Europe or elsewhere , without a much greater emphasis on social justice .
while some of the very rich complain , as Warren Buffett did recently , that they do not pay enough taxes , the enlightened generosity of these happy few - who want to save capitalism and liberalism - is unlikely to be emulated by the new rich in the emerging countries , much less by the rich elsewhere .
let &apos;s be realistic : people like Buffett and Bill Gates have very few followers even among the very rich in the US .
and can Asian societies really revive an effective sense of family responsibility ?
globalization does appear to have weakened cultural differences noticeably in the past decade .
but , when it comes to the protection of the weakest and the struggle against rising social injustice , perhaps &quot; global deculturation &quot; creates an opportunity to combine the best of what remains in particular traditions .
perhaps countries should seek to base their social @-@ welfare systems on a new synthesis of the state , the family , and philanthropy .
who Will Rescue the Rest of Us ?
Sydney - The rescue of the 33 Chilean miners , from what was feared would be their tomb , gave the world something to cheer about .
hope has not , after all , become a redundant virtue in the twenty @-@ first century .
but , looking around us today , there do not seem to be many reasons for optimism elsewhere .
the world lurches towards a currency war , or even towards trade protectionism , threatening to destroy jobs and growth .
America &apos;s recovery from recession is anemic and largely jobless .
China , meanwhile , with foreign reserves worth half its total output , denies with a straight face that it is deliberately manipulating the value of the renminbi . so its trade surplus continues to soar at the expense of other countries .
nor does a global solution to the challenge of climate change appear any closer .
a few weeks of rain in Australia has emboldened those who think that global warming is a gigantic hoax perpetrated by the United Nations or conspiring scientists or maybe men from Mars .
the war in Afghanistan bleeds more lives and treasure into the inhospitable terrain of that sad land , with little immediate chance of whatever might constitute sufficient success to allow America and its allies to quit . and the problems of Pakistan fester next door .
in Palestine , Israeli colonies continue to grow with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ignoring Washington &apos;s efforts to secure traction for the peace process .
Europeans continue to look inward , obsessed with their own problems of declining competitiveness and how to pay for entitlements that they have come to regard as theirs by right .
with the gap between the world &apos;s rich and poor increasing , the impoverished South seeks a home or a job in the developed North .
legal and illegal migration triggers far @-@ right hostility in countries that customarily brag about their commitment to civil liberties .
so , as Lenin once asked , what is to be done ?
the world obviously needs political leadership of the highest quality to see us through .
we need the sort of courage that was the hallmark of Margaret Thatcher . we need Bill Clinton &apos;s extraordinary ability to spin a political narrative that enabled voters to identify their own interests with his goals .
we require Helmut Kohl &apos;s understanding of the need to identify the big decisions in politics , and to get those decisions right .
we need leaders with sufficient mastery of detail , like China &apos;s last premier Zhu Rongji , who can not only tell us how they will get us from A to Z , but can actually lead us from A to B .
looking around , leaders like this seem to be an extinct species .
or , if they exist at all , they appear to be constrained by dysfunctional political systems . their ability to act is limited by their political environment .
the best example is US President Barack Obama , on whom so many hopes rested - probably too many for any one leader .
Obama inherited messy and expensive wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , and an economy in meltdown .
his attempts to revive the economy have inevitably driven up the deficit .
but no recovery in the labor or housing markets has yet materialized .
now Obama faces defeat in the mid @-@ term elections at the hands of Republicans whose past policies created many of the problems that weigh him down today .
they want less government , lower taxes , and a smaller deficit , a combination to be achieved seemingly without pain .
this nonsense on stilts is articulated by some zany candidates who enjoy the support of the Tea Party , a reference not to the Mad Hatter in Alice in Wonderland , which would be fitting , but to the Bostonians who rebelled against colonial Britain &apos;s imposition of taxes in the eighteenth century .
the rest of the world needs a strong , self @-@ confident , and decisive America .
but America &apos;s political system is about to deliver a balance of power in Washington that is likely to produce stalemate and paralysis .
in Europe , meanwhile , many of our problems are exemplified by what is happening in France , where President Nicolas Sarkozy &apos;s attempt to recognize demographic and fiscal reality by raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 provoked a wave of strikes and stormy protests from workers and students .
is there not something deeply depressing about 18 @-@ year @-@ olds demonstrating about the retirement age ?
how on earth did they acquire such a statist and conservative mind @-@ set ?
perhaps , then , Asia is the answer .
perhaps the Singapore @-@ based strategist Kishore Mahbubani is correct to write off the West and tell us that the future lies in his own continent .
the evidence on that point is mixed .
India is a glorious democracy with an economically literate government and pockets of real economic achievement .
but the fiasco in the run @-@ up to the Commonwealth Games showcased some of India &apos;s problems , not least deep corruption and inadequate infrastructure .
if those problems were sorted out , India &apos;s growth rate would outstrip China &apos;s .
and what of the booming Middle Kingdom ?
in Brussels the other day , Premier Wen Jiabao scolded European leaders for pressing for the renminbi &apos;s revaluation .
did they not understand , he argued , that this would lead to factory closures and social turbulence in China ?
elsewhere , of course , this sort of turmoil has democratic safety valves .
it is more than odd to argue that the rest of the world has to cope with a built @-@ in advantage for China &apos;s exporters because its authoritarian political system cannot cope with any change .
no wonder the impressive premier is thought to favor some political loosening .
from East to West , politics seems to be operating in a manner that is , to be diplomatic , sub @-@ optimal .
then again , maybe we &apos;re lucky that things aren &apos;t worse .
the Chilean miners survived against the odds , so perhaps the rest of us will somehow get by as well .
but who , exactly , is responsible for the rescue operation ?
who Will Run the World ?
Singapore - Barack Obama &apos;s election comes at a moment when a new bit of conventional wisdom is congealing .
it concerns the end of America &apos;s global dominance .
true , freewheeling American @-@ style capitalism has not acquitted itself proudly of late .
and America &apos;s military superiority has not proved all that useful in accomplishing American ends .
but who may pick up the slack in providing global leadership ?
the uncomfortable answer that Obama is likely to confront is this : nobody .
America may be damaged , but no replacement is on offer .
Europe is self @-@ absorbed , focused on creating whatever kind of entity it ends up deciding to be .
China &apos;s standard response to any suggestion that it exercise global leadership is to hide beneath its vast internal agenda and plead poverty .
no other country comes close to having either the capacity or the ambition .
in the face of the familiar litany of desperate global problems - not just financial instability , but also climate change , energy insecurity , potential pandemics , terrorism , and the spread of weapons of mass destruction - the prospect of a rudderless world is more than alarming .
what is to be done ?
and by whom ?
given that the United States has not been playing much of a leadership role on many of these issues recently , it is worth taking a look at what happens when no one country exercises effective leadership .
one set of answers might seem apparent from the collapse of international trade negotiations and the unraveling international system to control the spread of nuclear weapons .
things can certainly get grim .
but that is not the whole story .
to see why , consider climate change .
it is now clear that avoiding catastrophic climate change requires dramatic and rapid reductions in greenhouse @-@ gas emissions , cuts that would lower annual emissions to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
yet emissions are not just rising , but accelerating .
the coming recession may stem their growth temporarily , but only slightly .
the necessary reductions imply a rapid and radical transformation of industrial , energy , and land @-@ use systems around the world .
what are governments doing about this ?
supposedly , by December 2009 they will agree on a new treaty to set limits on emissions .
but the prospects that an agreement will be reached in Copenhagen in December 2009 are close to nil .
the new Obama administration will have only a few months to develop meaningful proposals that can win domestic support , and will be preoccupied with the aftermath of the current financial debacle and the Iraq war .
Europe is pushing for ambitious targets but is having trouble with its own vested interests .
the large emerging countries , although they will suffer disproportionately from wilder weather and rising sea levels , show little interest in picking up the slack .
negotiation watchers term the current American @-@ Chinese dance of mutual blame a suicide pact .
in short , the process is a mess .
this is hardly surprising .
an inter @-@ governmental system that falls apart under the challenges of trade negotiations and proliferation threats is unlikely to master the deep complexity and multitudinous vested interests that the issue of climate change entails .
traditional diplomacy will at best devise a face @-@ saving but meaningless accord next year .
in many areas , frustration with inter @-@ governmental intransigence and incompetence has sparked extraordinary innovation by non @-@ governmental organizations , corporations , and ordinary people .
private organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council and the Marine Stewardship Council provide and , increasingly , implement environmental standards where inter @-@ governmental action has failed .
private actors from foundations to pharmaceutical corporations to NGOs are actively experimenting with alternative ways to tackle transnational health challenges .
often governments are part of these experiments - but they are not necessarily the drivers , and progress does not depend on signing treaties .
indeed , there are many ways to put matters on the global agenda , as shown by Bono &apos;s campaigns on African development and Al Gore &apos;s on climate change .
agreements about how to make things better already frequently include NGOs and corporations in various capacities - and sometimes exclude governments altogether .
private groups using everything from satellite imagery ( as in forestry ) to the unofficial equivalent of on @-@ site inspections ( as in human rights ) monitor who is abiding by - or violating - what standard of behavior .
while enforcement in the coercive sense remains the domain of states , coercive enforcement is rare even when it comes to inter @-@ governmental agreements .
whether countries abide by agreements has far more to do with international processes of persuasion , socialization , and capacity @-@ building - and those can be done by anyone with a good argument .
the big question today is whether all these alternative approaches can add up to more than a bit of desperate tinkering around the edges .
standard international @-@ relations thinking does not even entertain the question , and those conventional ways of seeing the world have blinded us to looking at this crucial question .
as a result , we do not yet know the answer .
data remain scarce .
there are hundreds of global public @-@ private partnerships working on various global ills - but few have been examined to see what good they do .
the mishmash of initiatives , actors , campaigns , and appeals creates opportunities for major progress - and mass confusion .
if there is to be real progress toward more effective and efficient global governance that can address the unprecedented challenges posed by climate change and the rest of the global agenda , we must do much more than look for an easy replacement for American hegemony .
we must figure out how to make sense of this enormous diversity of ways of saving the world .
citizen Bezos ?
new YORK - My very first serious job was as a fact @-@ checker for Forbes magazine ( now mostly a laissez @-@ faire collection of blogs ) .
I consider fact @-@ checkers to be the altar boys of journalism .
and , despite having left the church , I still feel a profound reverence for the holy truth .
so , in most of the discussion about business models occasioned by the sale of the Washington Post to Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos , the values that I have held dear are being tarnished .
how so ?
even reputable fact @-@ checkers disagree on the origin of the famous admonition to journalists : &quot; comfort the afflicted , and afflict the comfortable ! &quot;
( they even disagree on whether it was first directed at preachers or at newsmen ) .
in any case , journalism is one business in which the customer is not always right .
the challenge that business considerations pose to journalism - both news and commentary providers - takes the form of three separate temptations : to slant the news to please readers rather than inform them , and thus attract advertisers ; to slant the news to please advertisers directly ; and to slant the news to advance owners &quot; political or commercial interests .
these temptations have always been present , but &quot; hard &quot; news could be supported by constituency @-@ pleasing sections , advertiser @-@ pleasing features and product reviews , news @-@ you @-@ can @-@ use sections replete with ads for related goods , and , of course , the classified ads .
today , the church of newspaper journalism is fragmenting .
brands and advertisers can speak directly to customers , and markets no longer need the convening power of a newspaper to match buyers and sellers ( the purpose of classified ads ) .
investigative journalism and serious commentary , like religion , do not have a profit model .
they serve a higher purpose ( although they can be and often are corrupted or twisted for bad ends ) .
so , should we welcome Bezos &apos;s entry into this world ?
many commentators expect him to digitize @-@ monetize @-@ revolutionize the Post ( whatever that means ) .
but I think he bought it for a different purpose .
he is a canny businessman - that much is clear .
he runs Amazon tightly and for the long term ; it generates huge amounts of cash , which it reinvests on behalf of all of its shareholders .
but it is Bezos personally , not Amazon , who bought the Post .
this is a man who is a generous donor to the Long Now Foundation ( I am on its board ) and who personally founded and owns a rocket company , Blue Origin ( I am on the board of a competing company called XCOR ) .
I think - I hope ! - that Bezos will make the proper distinctions .
he understands the difference between media ( yet another of his personal investments is the Web site Business insider ) and journalism .
in our market @-@ driven times , we tend to think about the price of everything and the value of nothing , as Oscar Wilde put it .
but we are also discovering behavioral economics - the human quirks and emotional urges that drive people to do things that make little economic sense .
the best joke of all - that Bezos bought the Post by mistake through an errant one @-@ click purchase ( a capability patented by Amazon ) - has a ring of truth to it .
the purchase was not an economically motivated decision , though it was no mistake .
there probably is not a sustainable business model for newspapers like the Post .
but I do think there is sustainable value of the kind that no corporation or financially driven investor could ever justify .
Bezos &apos;s move is not like the recent purchases of Newsweek , where there was an illusion of turning it around , or the Boston Globe , bought by John Henry , who owns the Boston Red Sox baseball team and Liverpool Football Club .
perhaps the most interesting example is Rupert Murdoch - the son of an Australian news baron - who recently split his family @-@ controlled News Corporation , into the TV and film company 21st Century Fox and the less profitable new News Corp , which retains the news and publishing operations .
although Murdoch remains chairman of both , everyone expects him to focus more on the news business .
that portfolio includes both customer @-@ pleasing tabloids with a troubled history of pandering , spying , and bribing , and the venerable journalism of the Wall Street Journal &apos;s news pages - a contradiction that splitting the parent has not resolved .
and , finally , there is Project Syndicate itself ( which publishes this column ) .
originally funded by yet another billionaire , George Soros , Project Syndicate operates independently to provide hard @-@ to @-@ monetize informed opinion and analysis with nary an &quot; advertorial &quot; or product review in sight .
one way to think about the best business model for journalism is to think about the best business model for food .
is it an all @-@ you @-@ can @-@ eat buffet ?
a Tony à la carte sanctuary with great wines that generate most of the profit ?
a franchise with pre @-@ cooked dishes thawed and heated in huge ovens ?
all can work - but only with good management .
but there is also the philanthropic soup kitchen - in the Post &apos;s case , a high @-@ end one , delivering nutritious food in a world in which restaurants now give away less @-@ healthy food , because they use it to sell other goods .
in the end , I think Bezos wants less to own the Post than to set it free , for at least a generation or two .
as Bezos wrote in a memo to the staff : &quot; the values of the Post do not need changing .
the paper &apos;s duty will remain to its readers and not to the private interests of its owners .
we will continue to follow the truth wherever it leads .... &quot;
if I am wrong , I hope this commentary will help to afflict him into righteousness !
why America Must Not Re @-@ elect President Bush
I have never been heavily involved in partisan politics , but these are not normal times .
President George W. Bush is endangering the United States and the world &apos;s safety while undermining American values .
for opposing him , I have been demonized by the Bush campaign .
President Bush ran in 2000 on a platform promising a &quot; humble &quot; foreign policy .
if re @-@ elected , the Bush doctrine of preemptive action - and the invasion of Iraq - will be endorsed , and the world will have to live with the consequences .
by repudiating Bush &apos;s policies at the polls , America will have a chance to regain the respect and support of the world .
the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , required a strong response .
but they also led to suspension of the critical process so essential to a democracy - a full and fair discussion of the issues .
Bush silenced criticism by calling it unpatriotic .
for 18 months after 9 / 11 , he managed to suppress all dissent . that is how he led America in the wrong direction .
in fact , Bush played right into the hands of Osama bin Laden .
Afghanistan &apos;s invasion was justified : that was where bin Laden lived and al Qaeda had its training camps . invading Iraq was not .
it was Bush &apos;s unintended gift to bin Laden .
immediately after 9 / 11 , there was a spontaneous outpouring of sympathy for America worldwide . it has given way to widespread resentment .
there are many more people willing to risk their lives to kill Americans than there were on September 11 .
Bush likes to insist that terrorists hate Americans for what they are - a freedom loving people - not what they do .
but war and occupation create innocent victims .
we count the body bags of American soldiers - over 1,000 in Iraq .
the wider world also counts the Iraqis who get killed daily , perhaps 20 times more .
nor was the torture of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison the work of a few bad apples . it was part of a system of dealing with prisoners put in place by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld .
public opinion condemns America worldwide , and our troops in Iraq are paying the price .
Bush convinced people that he is good for American security by playing on the fears generated by the 9 / 11 attacks .
at a time of peril , people rally around the flag , and Bush exploited this by fostering a sense of danger .
his campaign assumes that people do not really care about the truth and will believe almost anything if it is repeated often enough .
there must be something wrong with Americans if we fall for it .
for instance , some 40 % of Americans still believe that Saddam Hussein was connected with 9 / 11 , although the 9 / 11 Commission - set up by Bush and chaired by a Republican - definitively established that no such connection existed .
I want to shout : &quot; wake up America .
don &apos;t you realize we are being misled ? &quot;
the war in Iraq was misconceived from start to finish - if it has a finish .
it is a war of choice , not necessity .
moreover , America went to war on false pretenses .
weapons of mass destruction could not be found , and the connection with al Qaeda could not be established .
Bush then claimed that America went to war to liberate Iraq .
but democracy cannot be imposed by force .
Saddam Hussein was a tyrant , and Iraqis - and the world - can rejoice in being rid of him .
but America had an obligation to maintain law and order ; instead , we stood idly by while Baghdad and other cities were ransacked .
if we had cared about the Iraqi people , we should have had more troops available for the occupation .
we should have provided protection not only for the oil ministry , but also other ministries , museums , and hospitals .
worse still , when American soldiers encountered resistance , they employed methods - invading homes and mistreating prisoners - that alienated and humiliated the population , generating resentment and rage .
the Bush administration &apos;s flip @-@ flops and missteps are legion .
first the Iraqi army was dissolved , then America tried to reconstitute it .
first the US tried to eliminate the Baathists , then America turned to them for help .
when the insurgency became intractable , America installed an Iraqi government . the man chosen to lead it was a protégé of the CIA with a reputation for being a strongman - a far cry from democracy .
despite the Bush campaign &apos;s efforts at spin control , the situation in Iraq is dire .
much of the western part of the country has been ceded to insurgents , the prospect of holding free and fair elections in January is fast receding , civil war looms .
Bush &apos;s war in Iraq has done untold damage to America as well , impairing its military power and undermining the morale of the armed forces .
before the war , America could project overwhelming force . not anymore .
Afghanistan is slipping from control .
North Korea , Iran , Pakistan , and other countries pursue nuclear programs with renewed vigor .
the Bush administration can be criticized for many other policies , but none are as important as Iraq .
the war has cost nearly $ 200 billion , and costs will continue to mount , because getting into Iraq was much easier than getting out will be .
Bush has been taunting John Kerry to explain how he would do things differently .
Kerry has responded that he would have done everything differently , and that he would be in a better position to extricate us .
but it won &apos;t be easy for him , either , because America is caught in a quagmire .
top military and diplomatic experts desperately warned Bush not to invade Iraq . he ignored them .
he suppressed the critical process , arguing that any criticism of the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief puts US troops at risk .
but this is Bush &apos;s war , and he ought to be held responsible for it .
Americans should step back for a moment and ask : who got them into this mess ?
a moment &apos;s reflection should raise another question : does Bush &apos;s Texas swagger qualify him to remain America &apos;s Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief ?
calling Off America &apos;s bombs
new YORK - As the US Congress considers whether to authorize American military intervention in Syria , its members should bear in mind a basic truth : while Syrian President Bashar Al @-@ Assad has repeatedly used extreme violence to retain power , the United States - and other governments in the Middle East and Europe - share responsibility for turning Syria into a killing field .
these governments , led by the US , have explicitly sought the violent overthrow of Assad .
without their involvement , Assad &apos;s regime would most likely have remained repressive ; with their involvement , Syria has become a site of mass death and destruction .
more than 100,000 people have died , and many of the world &apos;s cultural and archaeological treasures have been demolished .
Syria &apos;s civil war has occurred in two phases .
the first phase , roughly from January 2011 until March 2012 , was largely an internal affair .
when the Arab Spring erupted in Tunisia and Egypt in January 2011 , protests erupted in Syria as well .
in addition to the usual grievances under a brutal regime , Syrians were reeling from a massive drought and soaring food prices .
the protests became a military rebellion when parts of the Syrian army broke with the regime and established the Free Syrian Army .
neighboring Turkey was probably the first outside country to support the rebellion on the ground , giving sanctuary to rebel forces along its border with Syria .
although the violence was escalating , the death toll was still in the thousands , not tens of thousands .
the second phase began when the US helped to organize a large group of countries to back the rebellion .
at a meeting of foreign ministers in Istanbul on April 1 , 2012 , the US and other countries pledged active financial and logistical support for the Free Syrian Army .
most important , then @-@ Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared : &quot; we think Assad must go . &quot;
that open @-@ ended statement , without any clear means to achieve the goal that it announced , has done much to fuel military escalation and the rising death toll in Syria , while pushing the US repeatedly to defend its &quot; credibility &quot; against a line in the sand that it should not have drawn .
then and now , the US has claimed to speak in the interest of the Syrian people .
this is very doubtful .
the US views Syria mainly through the lens of Iran , seeking to depose Assad in order to deprive Iran &apos;s leaders of an important ally in the region , one that borders Israel .
the US @-@ led effort in Syria is thus best understood as a proxy war with Iran - a cynical strategy that has contributed to the massive rise in violence .
the US government &apos;s misguided move from potential mediator and problem solver to active backer of the Syrian insurrection was , predictably , a terrible mistake .
it put the US in effective opposition to the United Nations peace initiative then being led by former UN Secretary @-@ General Kofi Annan , whose approach was to call for a ceasefire followed by a negotiated political transition .
the US preempted this process by backing the military rebellion and insisting on Assad &apos;s immediate departure .
it is hard to understand this blunder .
even if the US ultimately sought to force Assad from office , its blunt action hardened Assad &apos;s resistance , as well as that of his two allies in the UN Security Council , Russia and China .
aside from seeking to defend their own interests in the region , both countries understandably rejected the idea of US @-@ led regime change in Syria .
Russia argued that America &apos;s insistence on Assad &apos;s immediate departure was an impediment to peace .
in this , Russia was right .
indeed , Russia was playing a plausibly constructive role at the time , albeit one premised on Assad remaining in power for at least a transitional period , if not indefinitely .
Russia sought a pragmatic approach that would protect its commercial interests in Syria and its naval base at the port of Tartus , while bringing an end to the bloodletting .
the Russians openly backed Annan &apos;s peace initiative .
yet , with the US and others financing the rebels , Russia ( and Iran ) supplied more - and more sophisticated - weapons to the regime .
now , with the use of chemical weapons , probably by the Syrian government ( and possibly by both sides ) , the US has again ratcheted up the stakes .
bypassing the UN once again , the US is declaring its intention to intervene directly by bombing Syria , ostensibly to deter the future use of chemical weapons .
America &apos;s motivations are not entirely clear .
perhaps there is no underlying foreign @-@ policy logic , but only carelessness .
if there is a kind of logic , however weak , it seems to revolve around Iran and Israel , rather than Syria per se .
there are many dictatorships in the world that the US does not try to overthrow .
on the contrary , many of them are ostensibly America &apos;s close allies .
so why does the US continue to back a deadly rebellion in a civil war that is continuing to escalate dangerously , now to the point of chemical @-@ weapons attacks ?
to put it simply , President Barack Obama &apos;s administration has inherited the neoconservative philosophy of regime change in the Middle East .
the overriding idea is that the US and its close allies get to choose who governs in the region .
Assad must go not because he is authoritarian , but because he is allied with Iran , which , from the perspective of the US , Israel , Turkey , and several Gulf countries , makes him a regional threat .
in fact , the US has probably been lured into serving these countries &quot; own narrower interests , whether it be Israel &apos;s unconvincing vision of its own security or the Sunni countries &quot; opposition to Shia Iran .
but , in the long term , US foreign policy divorced from international law cannot produce anything other than more war .
the US should reverse course .
a direct US attack on Syria without UN backing is far more likely to inflame the region than it is to resolve the crisis there - a point well appreciated in the United Kingdom , where Parliament bucked the government by rejecting British participation in a military strike .
instead , the US should provide evidence of the chemical attacks to the UN ; call on the Security Council to condemn the perpetrators ; and refer such violations to the International Criminal Court .
moreover , the Obama administration should try to work with Russia and China to enforce the Chemical Weapons Convention .
if the US fails in this , while acting diplomatically and transparently ( without a unilateral attack ) , Russia and China would find themselves globally isolated on this important issue .
more broadly , the US should stop using countries like Syria as proxies against Iran .
withdrawal of US financial and logistical support for the rebellion , and calling on others to do the same , would not address Syria &apos;s authoritarianism or resolve America &apos;s issues with Iran , but it would stop or greatly reduce the large @-@ scale killing and destruction in Syria itself .
it would also enable the UN peace process to resume , this time with the US and Russia working together to restrain violence , keep Al Qaeda at bay ( a shared interest ) , and find a longer @-@ term pragmatic solution to Syria &apos;s deep domestic divisions .
and the search for a US modus vivendi with Iran - where a new president suggests a change of course on foreign policy - could be revived .
it is time for the US to help stop the killing in Syria .
that means abandoning the fantasy that it can or should determine who rules in the Middle East .
diplomacy and Double Standards
Canberra - When does acceptable diplomatic caution and realism become indefensible abdication of moral standards ?
not everyone on the foreign @-@ policy frontline cares , but those who do often face deeply uncomfortable choices .
negotiating a life @-@ saving peace may mean giving amnesty to the murderously guilty .
living with tyranny might be less life @-@ threatening than embracing anarchy .
calming a volatile situation may mean not publicly denouncing behavior that cries out for condemnation .
making the right call is more difficult in the real world than in a philosophy classroom .
but sometimes the line really is crossed , all relevant players know it , and the consequences are potentially profound .
the United States &quot; failure so far to cut off its military aid to Egypt in response to the regime &apos;s massacre of hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters , in the streets and in prisons , is as clear a recent case as one can find .
former President Mohamed Morsi &apos;s government was a catastrophic failure - ruthlessly ideological , economically illiterate , and constitutionally irresponsible .
it deeply polarized a society yearning for a new inclusiveness .
but , had the army held its nerve - and triggers - there is every reason to believe that Morsi would have been voted out in the next election .
if the Muslim Brotherhood denied a ballot , or refused to accept defeat , tougher measures could then have been contemplated .
as it is , the army &apos;s coup was indefensible , and its slaughter of mostly unarmed protesters ranks in infamy with the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989 , and those of Libya &apos;s former leader , Muammar el @-@ Qaddafi , and Syria &apos;s Hafez and Bashar al @-@ Assad .
it is not as if maintaining its $ 1.3 billion in annual military aid gives the US any leverage over Egypt &apos;s behavior .
it might have once , but the amount now pales in significance next to the $ 12 billion in economic assistance recently rushed to the generals by Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and the United Arab Emirates .
certainly , the regime would resent withdrawal of this aid , as would most of the Brotherhood &apos;s civilian opponents ; but that matters less than the impact on American credibility , in the Middle East and the rest of the world , of not doing so .
unless political leaders know that tearing up the rule book on the scale seen in Egypt will expose them to more than rhetorical consequences , the tacit message - that regimes that pick the &quot; right &quot; targets can repress at will - will resonate in Bahrain , Yemen , and Saudi Arabia , not to mention Syria .
farther afield , the US risks reinforcing the perception that it is comfortable with double standards .
for a country whose global leadership depends as much on its soft power as on its military might , that is dynamite .
the charge sheet here is already rather full , with multiple instances in recent years of America being almost universally regarded as not practicing what it preaches .
for starters , there was the invasion of Iraq in 2003 : embracing the United Nations Security Council when you get your way , but bypassing it when you don &apos;t , does not do much to encourage a cooperative rule @-@ based international order .
then there was the Palestinian election of 2006 : promoting democracy generates ridicule when it extends only to elections that produce palatable winners , as Gaza &apos;s vote for Hamas did not .
or , again in the Middle East , there has been the blind eye endlessly turned to Israel &apos;s actual possession of nuclear weapons , in contrast to the response to Iran &apos;s possible early moves in that direction .
and there was the 2008 agreement to trade nuclear material and technology with India , despite its unwillingness to accept serious new disarmament or non @-@ proliferation commitments .
to be fair to the US , such double standards abound among other major powers as well .
Russia &apos;s invocation of the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; to justify its 2008 invasion of Georgia was met with incredulity at the time , and rendered even more cynical by its resolute failure since 2011 to condemn the Syrian regime for mass @-@ atrocity crimes against its own people .
China &apos;s strategic aspirations in the South China Sea , and its unwillingness to embrace a maritime code of conduct there , sit uncomfortably with its stated concern for sovereign boundaries and the peaceful resolution of territorial disputes .
and every one of the nuclear @-@ armed states has been guilty of &quot; do as I say , not as I do &quot; in insisting on non @-@ proliferation while making no serious commitment to disarmament .
to be fair to diplomatic policymakers everywhere , it is often the case that hard choices between competing moral values - for example , justice and peace - simply have to be made .
and positions that are claimed to embody double standards are often nothing of the kind .
a good example is the allegation that the &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; principle is inherently flawed , because the major powers will always be immune from intervention , not only because five of them can exercise a Security Council veto , but also because of their inherent military strength .
but this ignores the principle that no military intervention will ever be legitimate unless it satisfies , among other criteria , the test of diminishing , not augmenting , human suffering . and going to war against any of the major powers to protect a suffering minority would certainly trigger a much wider conflagration .
the bottom line is that values matter in international relations , and states that place great emphasis on the promotion of values are extremely vulnerable to charges of hypocrisy .
no state that aspires to win the support or cooperation of others can afford to be seen to be comfortable with unambiguous double standards .
and worst of all is to be perceived as being soft on those who , like Egypt &apos;s current military rulers , commit mass @-@ atrocity crimes against their own citizens .
why America Will Lead the &quot; Asian Century &quot;
Singapore - Not a week passes , it seems , without a big @-@ picture thinker releasing a big @-@ picture book or giving a big @-@ picture Sermon describing the gradual eclipse of American hegemony in Asia .
true , American power will inevitably decline in relative terms as Asian giants such as China and India rise .
but , at least as far as Asia is concerned , arguments about the end of American hegemony ring hollow .
for one thing , the United States was never a hegemon in Asia .
only some American post @-@ Cold War triumphalists thought it was .
the nature of US power and the exercise of its influence was always much more clever and subtle than most assume .
in fact , as India and China rise , the US could actually find itself in a stronger position .
how can this be ?
after all , power and influence are built on the back of economic success .
the Chinese economy has been doubling in size every ten years since 1978 .
the Indian economy has been doing the same since 1991 .
in contrast , it takes about two decades for the US economy to double in size .
doesn &apos;t this surely mean that Asia is rushing toward a state of multi @-@ polarity - a configuration of roughly equal great powers balancing against each other - while American influence is on the wane ?
the seemingly obvious conclusion would be true but for the fact that Asia has a unique kind of hierarchical security system that came about partly by accident and partly by design .
no power can be preeminent if it cannot maintain its military advantage over rivals .
yet , despite the fact that America spends more on defense than the next ten powers combined , it has never been a regional hegemon because it actually relies on the cooperation of other states to remain predominant .
without cooperation from allies such as Japan , South Korea , Singapore , and the Philippines , the US could not retain its forward military positions in the West Pacific .
likewise , the US needs the cooperation of Indonesia , Malaysia , and Thailand to host its critical radar infrastructure .
moreover , in remaining preeminent , America requires other key states and regional groupings , such as ASEAN , to acquiesce in its security relationships .
thus , there is broad @-@ based regional approval of US alliances with Japan , South Korea , and Australia , as well as with partners such as the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand , and India .
the key to the effectiveness of these bilateral relationships is that they enjoy widespread support ( and thus legitimacy ) in the region as stabilizing arrangements .
the whole is greater than the sum of its parts .
combined with the raw military capacity that the US brings to the table , this means that America is powerful enough to enforce the peace and provide stability for commerce to thrive .
America &apos;s presence and bilateral partnerships are complementary to Asian states &quot; obsession with counter @-@ dominance and non @-@ interference in the region .
this dynamic &quot; liberal order &quot; - largely fair , flexible , and open enough to welcome new entrants as they rise - will continue to serve Asia well .
for example , even China has been a major beneficiary of the public goods provided by the US @-@ led hierarchical system .
this interdependent relationship means that the US is not so powerful , that it can readily ignore the wishes of key states , and it is here that its apparent weakness is actually strength .
America is not a Hobbesian Leviathan with absolute authority and power .
indeed , China &apos;s strategists are frequently puzzled by the lack of &quot; balancing &quot; that takes place against the US in the region .
but it is puzzling only if we characterize Asia as being multi @-@ polar rather than hierarchical .
in fact , any balancing tends to take place in order to preserve the hierarchy , not to replace or supersede it .
other states tend to resist bids by any Asian power - be it Japan , China or India - to rise to the top of the pyramid .
as a foreign @-@ based power , the US needs the cooperation of Asian partners .
this keeps the top dog in check .
were an Asian country like China to rise to the top , it would not need the same level of regional cooperation and acquiescence to maintain its position and military footholds .
as China and India rise , and Japan becomes more &quot; normal , &quot; they will balance each other within the US @-@ led hierarchy to ensure that the US remains on top and one or the other doesn &apos;t dominate .
if China makes a bid for regional hegemony , it will find it difficult to resist the structural constraints placed on it within this hierarchy .
US power is in relative decline , but that is no bad thing .
false triumphalism breeds poor discipline .
but a sense of strategic vulnerability breeds interdependency , which has always been the key to successful US leadership in Asia .
China without North Korea
Nottingham - North Korea &apos;s third nuclear test is a game changer not only for the United States and Japan , but also for the regime &apos;s last ally , China .
the official Chinese reaction to North Korea &apos;s latest provocation was stern : China is &quot; strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed &quot; to the test , and it is calling for the resumption of international talks .
but China &apos;s stance lacks meaningful bite , because its leaders fail to recognize that they no longer need to succumb to their unruly neighbor &apos;s blackmail .
in carrying out the test , the North Koreans have once again compromised China &apos;s national interests .
the international community is again firmly focused on China &apos;s relationship with its rogue ally , and expects that , as an emerging superpower seeking to reassure the world of its peaceful rise , China will play a constructive role .
however limited China &apos;s influence may be , the North Korean regime can sustain itself only with Chinese backing .
with North Korea &apos;s latest nuclear test coming so quickly after its rocket launch in December , the United Nations has good reason to ask China , a permanent Security Council member , to take the diplomatic lead .
it is simply not enough for China to call , as its official statement does , for the resumption of the Six @-@ Party Talks with South Korea , China , the US , Japan , and Russia .
that framework has been thoroughly discredited by North Korea &apos;s repeated violation of past agreements .
China must warn North Korea that it will not be pressured into providing support even when Chinese national interests have been undermined .
indeed , China should make clear that , much as it would prefer North Korea to survive and prosper , it could afford to allow its erstwhile ally to implode .
simply put , the conventional wisdom that North Korea &apos;s collapse would be disastrous for China is misconceived . any crisis sparked by North Korean refugees fleeing across the Chinese border would be short @-@ lived , and international assistance would be readily available .
likewise , China need not fear a South Korea @-@ led unification of the peninsula .
China already enjoys a smoother relationship with the South than it does with the North .
unification would occupy the Korean people for the next two decades , with Japan and the US compelled to inject a huge amount of aid to rebuild and reintegrate the North .
this hardly runs counter to China &apos;s interests as it continues its own advance toward becoming the world &apos;s largest economy .
indeed , if this process were to unfold , the US rationale for keeping its own military forces in South Korea would disappear .
a phased reduction of the American presence would follow . if the US wished to maintain bases in Korea in the longer term , it would have to secure permission from a proud and newly united Korean nation - hardly a forgone conclusion .
moreover , a united Korea will have inherited the North &apos;s nuclear weapons .
this will pose challenges to US @-@ Korea relations , which should work to China &apos;s advantage .
the US will remain committed to de @-@ nuclearizing the peninsula , while the Korean government will be tempted to retain the North &apos;s nuclear capabilities .
this strain further reduces the risk of having US troops stationed on the Korean side of China &apos;s border .
China must also consider the implications of North Korea &apos;s actions on its own fractious relations with Japan .
Chinese President Xi Jinping &apos;s top foreign @-@ policy priority is to force the Japanese government to acknowledge , if not accept , China &apos;s territorial claims in the two countries &quot; dispute over the Diaoyu / Senkaku islands in the East China Sea .
Chinese naval ships have already trained their weapons on a Japanese destroyer and a Japanese naval helicopter .
in these incidents , the single most important reason for Japanese restraint has been its military &apos;s own rules of engagement .
under current law , Japanese security forces are forbidden from firing their weapons unless clearly fired upon , which means that the country &apos;s Maritime Self @-@ Defense Force vessels can do little when targeted by Chinese naval radar .
and revising the rules to allow Japan &apos;s military to , say , destroy a North Korean missile before it reaches Japanese air space would increase the risk of conflict between Chinese and Japanese naval and air forces .
if the Chinese leadership can think beyond its usual default response to North Korean misbehavior - abstract condemnation followed by a call for dialogue - it can apply real pressure on the North Korean regime in full view of the international community .
North Korea &apos;s last ally should give it one last chance . and then it should be prepared to pull the plug .
Apple &apos;s Cash @-@ Flow Problem
Cambridge - I recently examined the problem of corporate short @-@ termism from two nonstandard angles .
one was that some short @-@ termism is sensible .
large firms face an increasingly fluid economic , technological , and political environment - owing to more global and competitive markets , to the greater potential of technological change to alter firms &quot; business environment , and to governments &quot; growing influence over what makes business sense .
in this fluid environment , large companies must be cautious before making large , long @-@ term commitments .
second , I described how emerging data could suggest measurement problems with the conventional wisdom that more rapid trading in financial markets is making them more oriented to the short term than ever before .
proponents of this view point to furious trading in New York and London , with average holding periods for major stocks diminishing in recent decades .
in fact , the change may be driven by a rapidly trading minority , and not by major stockholders shortening their holding periods .
indeed , the average holding period for America &apos;s core shareholders , like Fidelity and Vanguard , has increased in recent decades .
( I examine these issues in greater depth in a longer forthcoming article . )
the shareholder activism around Apple highlights the importance and controversy of the short @-@ term problem .
Apple has been spectacularly successful in the past decade .
its products , from iPhones to iPads to MacBooks , have captured consumers &quot; imaginations , remade markets , and earned the company and its shareholders huge sums of money .
Apple &apos;s stock capitalization has soared , and it became the first trillion @-@ dollar company .
as Apple &apos;s profits have grown , it has amassed $ 137 billion in cash , according to a recent count - more than it can profitably use ( at least for now ) in its operations .
so the company has wisely left its cash invested in global financial accounts , not business operations .
meanwhile , its staggeringly successful products are generating still more cash to handle and stockpile .
enter shareholder activist David Einhorn , whose hedge fund Greenlight Capital has been pressing Apple to distribute a healthy fraction of that cash .
much commentary on the foray has been negative : Einhorn &apos;s proposal is a short @-@ run , financial @-@ engineering idea for a company that has gone from success to success , it is said - American stock @-@ market short @-@ termism at its worst .
maybe it is .
maybe investors are being too quick to pressure a great company .
but , odd as it might seem , getting its cash out could be a good long @-@ term strategy for Apple .
there has long been a life cycle for firms : young firms innovate , are cash @-@ hungry , and have to scramble for financing .
some succeed , sell their products , and find themselves pulling in more cash than they need .
great companies take that cash and invest it in even better products , taking the firm to new heights .
Apple has been one of those companies .
but , inevitably , the firm &apos;s technologies become standardized and commoditized .
new , hotter technologies come along , and the firm no longer attracts the best people to work for it , because , well , it &apos;s no longer the next new thing .
new products stall , old products are not as profitable as they once were ( because competitors figure out how to make something better ) , and markets and consumers move on .
firms that reach that point , and that know themselves , then return more of their cash hoard to their investors , who invest it elsewhere .
in the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , large swaths of American industry - especially the domestic oil industry - faced this problem , described by the economist Michael Jensen as the managerial challenge of handling free cash flow well .
where is Apple in that company life cycle ?
is it still in its youth , cash @-@ starved with more ideas than it can finance ?
is it middle @-@ aged , but nimble and able to remake itself , as it did several times during Steve Jobs &quot; tenure ?
does it need $ 137 billion to engineer and finance a large @-@ scale Apple TV that will be even more successful than iPhones and iPads ?
or has the company peaked ?
could the rollout last fall of the inferior Apple Maps , which sent people to the wrong destination - causing severe public embarrassment and leading to a managerial shakeup - foreshadow a time when Apple &apos;s best days are behind it ?
the company could be at a high plateau and could stay there for years , even decades , but does it really need $ 137 billion in cash for new investments ?
here is another way of looking at the Apple problem : if Apple continues to succeed , won &apos;t it generate the cash that it needs for innovation from its super @-@ products , like the iPad , the iPhone , and the MacBook ?
roughly 70 % of Apple &apos;s revenues come from the iPhone and the iPad .
will those products last , or will they be superseded ?
were those products &quot; success the result of a unique Apple asset , namely Steve Jobs , or is the company well positioned to produce the next big thing ?
could it be too tempting in the short run to Apple &apos;s management to have that $ 137 billion in the bank , so that it spends some or all of it on investments that fail to pan out in the long run ?
it is at least possible - maybe even likely - that Apple &apos;s best long @-@ term move would be to release a hefty portion of its unused cash to its shareholders , who would then plow it back into the economy .
meanwhile , it can finance its next new thing from the cash that its great products will continue to generate .
what is being criticized as short @-@ termism could well be a long @-@ term financial strategy that is just right for Apple .
why Are Good Policies Bad Politics ?
Berkeley - From the day after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last year , the policies followed by the United States Treasury , the US Federal Reserve , and the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have been sound and helpful . the alternative - standing back and letting the markets handle things - would have brought America and the world higher unemployment than now exists .
credit easing and support of the banking system helped significantly by preventing much worse .
the fact that investment bankers did not go bankrupt last December and are profiting immensely this year is a side issue .
every extra percentage point of unemployment lasting for two years costs $ 400 billion .
a recession twice as deep as the one we have had would have cost the US roughly $ 2 trillion - and cost the world as a whole four times as much .
in comparison , the bonuses at Goldman Sachs are a rounding error .
and any attempt to make investment bankers suffer more last fall and winter would have put the entire support operation at risk .
as Fed Vice Chairman Don Kohn said , ensuring that a few thousand investment bankers receive their just financial punishment is a non @-@ starter when attempts to do so put the jobs of millions of Americans - and tens of millions outside the US - at risk .
the Obama administration &apos;s fiscal stimulus has also significantly helped the economy .
though the jury is still out on the effect of the tax cuts in the stimulus , aid to states has been a job @-@ saving success , and the flow of government spending on a whole variety of relatively useful projects is set to boost production and employment in the same way that consumer spending boosts production and employment .
and the cost of carrying the extra debt incurred is extraordinarily low : $ 12 billion a year of extra taxes would be enough to finance the fiscal @-@ stimulus program at current interest rates .
for that price , American taxpayers will get an extra $ 1 trillion of goods and services , and employment will be higher by about ten million job @-@ years .
the valid complaints about fiscal policy over the past 14 months are not that it has run up the national debt and rewarded the princes of Wall Street , but rather that it has been too limited - that we ought to have done more .
yet these policies are political losers now : nobody is proposing more stimulus .
this is strange , because usually when something works the natural impulse is to do it again .
good policies that are boosting production and employment without causing inflation ought to be politically popular , right ?
with respect to Obama &apos;s stimulus package , it seems to me that there has been extraordinary intellectual and political dishonesty on the American right , which the press refuses to see .
for two and a half centuries , economists have believed that the flow of spending in an economy goes up whenever groups of people decide to spend more .
sometimes spending rises because there is more disposable cash in the economy , and sometimes because changes in opportunity costs - the cost of forgoing some other action , such as saving - make people want to spend the cash they have more rapidly . sometimes and to some degree these increases show up as increases in prices , and sometimes and to some degree as increases in production and employment .
but , whatever the cause or effect , spending always goes up whenever groups decide to spend more - and government decisions to spend more are as good as anybody else &apos;s .
they are as good as the decisions of mortgage companies and new homebuyers to spend more on new houses during the housing bubble of the mid @-@ 2000 &quot; s , or of the princes of Silicon Valley to spend more building new companies during the dot @-@ com bubble of the late 1990 &quot; s .
Obama &apos;s Republican opponents , who claim that fiscal stimulus cannot work , rely on arguments that are incoherent at best , and usually simply wrong , if not mendacious .
remember that back in 1993 , when the Clinton administration &apos;s analyses led it to seek to spend less and reduce the deficit , the Republicans said that that would destroy the economy , too .
such claims were as wrong then as they are now .
but how many media reports make even a cursory effort to evaluate them ?
a stronger argument , though not by much , is that the fiscal stimulus is boosting employment and production , but at too great a long @-@ run cost because it has produced too large a boost in America &apos;s national debt . if interest rates on US Treasury securities were high and rising rapidly as the debt grew , I would agree with this argument .
but interest rates on US Treasury securities are very low and are not rising . every single Treasury auction , at which the market gobbles up huge new tranches of US Treasury debt at high prices , belies the argument that the economy has too much debt .
those who claim that America has a debt problem , and that a debt problem cannot be cured with more debt , ignore ( sometimes deliberately ) that private debt and US Treasury debt have been very different animals - moving in different directions and behaving in different ways - since the start of the financial crisis .
what the market is saying is not that the economy has too much debt , but that it has too much private debt , which is why prices of corporate bonds are low and firms find financing expensive . the market is also saying - clearly and repeatedly - that the economy has too little public US government debt , which is why everyone wants to hold it .
why Are Governments paralyzed ?
Milan - It is no secret that the global economy is struggling .
Europe is in the midst of a crisis whose root cause is a structurally flawed monetary and economic union .
the United States , emerging slowly from a financial crisis and widespread deleveraging , is experiencing a growth slowdown , a persistent employment problem , an adverse shift in income distribution , and structural challenges , with little effective or decisive policy action .
meanwhile , among the major emerging economies , China &apos;s reform process is on hold , pending a leadership transition this fall that will clarify various internal interests &quot; goals and power relationships .
India , which has lost reform momentum , is experiencing an economic slowdown and a potential loss of investor confidence .
the negative effects of these problems are now interacting , feeding back on themselves , and spreading to the rest of the global economy .
and yet , despite a palpable sense of concern that something is very wrong , the prognosis for significant change is bleak - and deteriorating .
what accounts for the apparent lack of effective policy action across a broad range of countries and regions ?
one line of thinking blames a &quot; leadership vacuum &quot; - a common diagnosis in Europe .
elsewhere - especially in the US - polarization and ugly zero @-@ sum politics are thought to discourage potentially capable political leadership .
but , absent further analysis , the leadership vacuum becomes a catchall explanation .
what we need to know is why new political leadership in democracies like France , Britain , Japan , and the US has produced so little change .
a second explanation addresses that question : while bold action is required , the complexity of economic conditions , and disagreement about the right policy responses , implies a risk of serious error .
for professional politicians and policymakers in such circumstances , less may be more .
on this view , risk aversion both reflects and reinforces a divergence between individual incentives ( the desire to be reelected , reappointed , or promoted ) and collective needs ( fixing problems ) .
a third answer is that policy instruments are simply ineffective in today &apos;s conditions .
there is some merit to this claim .
economic deleveraging takes time .
the restoration of sustainable patterns of growth requires years , not months .
expectations may be out of line with the underlying reality .
but the absence of a quick solution does not mean that nothing can be done to improve the speed and quality of recovery .
vested interests may also play a role .
technological innovation and global market forces have produced a decisive shift in income toward capital and the upper 20 % of the income distribution , often at the expense of middle @-@ income groups , the unemployed , and the young .
the beneficiaries of these trends may have accumulated enough political influence to maintain the status quo , highlighting distributional issues that have generally received too little attention in understanding policy responses or their absence .
there are structural explanations for policy inaction as well .
governance systems and constitutional structures differ in the extent to which they require broad consensus for official action , or to change policy direction in response to shocks or shifting conditions .
some argue that the more constraining political systems work well in stable times , but perform poorly under volatile conditions like those prevailing today .
others support constrained government on the grounds that it protects everyone from waste , rent @-@ seeking , and interference with freedom of choice , and that , when needed , inspired leadership can build the required consensus to address changing circumstances .
high hurdles to major shifts in policy direction force officials to make a convincing case .
that is an inherently difficult task at a time when rapid change in the global economy has left many still trying to understand what is happening and what it all means for growth , stability , the distribution of income , and employment .
in the face of such complexity , it is not surprising that genuine policy disagreements lead to extended debate and relatively little action .
moreover , the technocratic elements of government must often be balanced against democratic accountability .
in every society , individuals with special training and expertise are appointed to perform technically complex functions .
their freedom of action is constrained by time limits and reappointment procedures that determine the nature and degree of their accountability to elected officials and the public .
there can be too little freedom of action ( populism ) or too little accountability ( autocracy ) .
the necessary balance may vary according to local conditions .
for example , many China observers believe that accountability there needs to increase at this stage of the country &apos;s economic , social , and political evolution .
others argue that Western democracies have the opposite problem : a surfeit of narrow , politically assertive interests leads to underinvestment and poor tradeoffs between present and future opportunities and performance .
this brings us to a crucial obstacle : government , business , financial , and academic elites are not trusted .
lack of trust in elites is probably healthy at some level , but numerous polls indicate that it is in rapid decline , which surely increases citizens &quot; reluctance to delegate authority to navigate an uncertain global economic environment .
loss of trust probably has multiple causes , including analytical failure : central banks , regulators , market participants , rating agencies , and economists almost all failed to detect rising systemic risk in the years preceding the current crisis , much less to take appropriate corrective action .
but a more important cause is a suspicion that elites are placing their own interests above shared social values .
claims that our leadership , institutions , analyses , or policy instruments are inadequate to the task at hand surely contain a kernel of truth .
but the deeper problem is a breakdown in precisely such values and goals - that is , a weakening of social cohesion .
restoring it will require analysts , policymakers , business leaders , and civil @-@ society groups to clarify causes , share blame for mistakes , pursue flexible solutions in which costs are shared equitably , and , most important , explain that hard problems cannot be solved overnight .
the Long Mystery of Low Interest Rates
Cambridge - As policymakers and investors continue to fret over the risks posed by today &apos;s ultra @-@ low global interest rates , academic economists continue to debate the underlying causes . by now , everyone accepts some version of US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s statement in 2005 that a &quot; global savings glut &quot; is at the root of the problem .
but economists disagree on why we have the glut , how long it will last , and , most fundamentally , on whether it is a good thing .
Bernanke &apos;s original speech emphasized several factors - some that decreased the demand for global savings , and some that increased supply .
either way , interest rates would have to fall in order for world bond markets to clear .
he pointed to how the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990 &quot; s caused the region &apos;s voracious investment demand to collapse , while simultaneously inducing Asian governments to stockpile liquid assets as a hedge against another crisis .
Bernanke also pointed to increased retirement saving by aging populations in Germany and Japan , as well as to saving by oil @-@ exporting countries , with their rapidly growing populations and concerns about oil revenues in the long term .
monetary policy , incidentally , did not feature prominently in Bernanke &apos;s diagnosis .
like most economists , he believes that if policymakers try to keep interest rates at artificially low levels for too long , eventually demand will soar and inflation will jump .
so , if inflation is low and stable , central banks cannot be blamed for low long @-@ term rates .
in fact , I strongly suspect that if one polled investors , monetary policy would be at the top of the list , not absent from it , as an explanation of low global long @-@ term interest rates .
the fact that so many investors hold this view ought to make one think twice before absolving monetary policy of all responsibility .
nevertheless , I share Bernanke &apos;s instinct that , while central banks do set very short @-@ term interest rates , they have virtually no influence over long @-@ term real ( inflation @-@ adjusted ) rates , other than a modest effect through portfolio management policies ( for example , &quot; quantitative easing &quot; ) .
a lot has changed since 2005 .
we had the financial crisis , and some of the factors cited by Bernanke have substantially reversed .
for example , Asian investment is booming again , led by China .
and yet global interest rates are even lower now than they were then .
why ?
there are several competing theories , most of them quite elegant , but none of them entirely satisfactory .
one view holds that long @-@ term growth risks have been on the rise , raising the premium on assets that are perceived to be relatively safe , and raising precautionary saving in general .
( of course , no one should think that any government bonds are completely safe , particularly from inflation and financial repression . )
certainly , the 2008 financial crisis should have been a wakeup call to proponents of the &quot; Great Moderation &quot; view that long @-@ term volatility has fallen .
many studies suggest that it is becoming more difficult than ever to anchor expectations about long @-@ term growth trends .
witness , for example , the active debate about whether technological progress is accelerating or decelerating .
shifting geopolitical power also breeds uncertainty .
another class of academic theories follows Bernanke ( and , even earlier , Michael Dooley , David Folkerts @-@ Landau , and Peter Garber ) in attributing low long @-@ term interest rates to the growing importance of emerging economies , but with the major emphasis on private savings rather than public savings .
because emerging economies have relatively weak asset markets , their citizens seek safe haven in advanced @-@ country government bonds .
a related theory is that emerging economies &quot; citizens find it difficult to diversify the huge risk inherent in their fast @-@ growing but volatile environments , and feel particularly vulnerable as a result of weak social safety nets .
so they save massively .
these explanations have some merit , but one should recognize that central banks and sovereign wealth funds , not private citizens , are the players most directly responsible for the big savings surpluses .
it is a strain to think that governments have the same motivations as private citizens .
besides , on closer inspection , the emerging @-@ market explanation , though convenient , is not quite as compelling as it might seem .
emerging economies are growing much faster than the advanced countries , which neoclassical growth models suggest should push global interest rates up , not down .
similarly , the integration of emerging @-@ market countries into the global economy has brought with it a flood of labor .
according to standard trade theory , a global labor glut ought to imply an increased rate of return on capital , which again pushes interest rates up , not down .
surely , any explanation must include the global constriction of credit , especially for small and medium @-@ size businesses .
tighter regulation of lending standards has shut out an important source of global investment demand , putting downward pressure on interest rates .
my best guess is that when global uncertainty fades and global growth picks up , global interest rates will start to rise , too .
but predicting the timing of this transition is difficult .
the puzzle of the global savings glut may live on for several years to come .
why Are Savings patterns So Different ?
Beijing - Ever since the integration of emerging markets into the global economy began in the early 1990 &quot; s , three striking trends have emerged : a divergence in private savings rates between the industrialized core and the emerging periphery ( the former experiencing a sharp rise , and the latter a steady decline ) ; large global imbalances between the two regions ; and a drop in interest rates worldwide .
but , while global imbalances have preoccupied many observers , few have sought to explain the divergence in world savings behavior .
in 1988 , the household savings rate in China and the United States was roughly equal , at about 5 % .
yet , by 2007 , China &apos;s household savings rate had risen to a staggering 30 % , compared to just 2.5 % in the US .
the pattern is not uncharacteristic of other industrialized countries relative to emerging markets over the last two decades ( figure 1 ) .
savings behavior invariably reacts to changes in interest rates , which have fallen steadily over the last two decades to today &apos;s record @-@ low levels .
but how can savings patterns be so different - often opposite - in globalized economies that are well integrated into world capital markets ?
the answer may be that credit markets are more developed in advanced economies than they are in emerging countries , particularly in terms of the degree to which households are able to borrow .
of course , one might argue that Asian thrift and American profligacy merely reflect asymmetric demands for credit : Asians are intrinsically more reluctant to borrow .
in that case , however , the vast differences in household debt ( figure 2 ) - ranging from 25 % of GDP in emerging Asia ( Southeast Asia , China , India , Hong Kong , and South Korea ) to more than 90 % in the US and other Anglo @-@ Saxon economies ( including Australia , Canada , Ireland , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom ) - would reflect only a dissimilarity in taste .
a more plausible explanation is that institutional differences in the ability to borrow dictate to some extent the disparity in savings rates across countries .
the argument is simple : all economies have both borrowers and savers , and changes in the cost of borrowing ( or the return to saving ) affect them differently .
when interest rates decline , borrowers are able to borrow more . savers , on the other hand , may be compelled to save more in the face of shrinking interest income .
at the macro level , a less credit @-@ constrained economy ( with a large mass of effective borrowers ) could then experience a fall in the savings rate as borrowing rose .
however , in a country with a large mass of effective savers , the savings rate can rise , rather than fall .
this asymmetry in savings patterns might thus reflect the simple fact that credit @-@ constrained economies are less sensitive to drops in the cost of borrowing relative to less constrained economies .
in joint research with Nicolas Coeurdacier and Stéphane Guibaud , we show that economic data supports this view .
borrowers and savers are naturally grouped by age .
the young normally face low , current wage income , but faster growth in future income , and would ideally borrow against future income to augment consumption today and to invest in education .
the middle @-@ aged , preparing for retirement , are likely to be the economy &apos;s savers .
if asymmetric credit constraints are indeed important , young borrowers and middle @-@ aged savers will display distinct patterns in constrained versus less @-@ constrained economies .
in fact , there was a remarkable contrast in savings behavior across age groups in China and the US in the period 1992 @-@ 2009 .
for young Americans ( those under 25 ) , the borrowing rate rose by ten percentage pointsmore than the borrowing rate of young Chinese , while the savings rate of the Chinese working @-@ age population ( ages 35 @-@ 54 ) rose by about 17 percentage points more than the savings rate of their American counterparts .
another implication of this view is that the steep rise in savings in China is largely driven by a rise in the savings rate of middle @-@ aged Chinese ( rather than a fall in the borrowing rate of the young ) .
conversely , the fall in savings in the US is largely due to higher borrowing by the young ( rather than a fall in middle @-@ aged Americans &quot; savings rate ) .
indeed , of the 20.2 @-@ percentage @-@ point increase in aggregate household savings ( as a share of GDP ) in China from 1992 to 2009 , the middle @-@ aged cohort accounted for more than 60 % ( the remainder was largely attributable to the elderly ) .
in the US , which experienced a 1.8 @-@ percentage @-@ point decline in aggregate savings as a share of GDP , the savings @-@ to @-@ GDP ratio among the young declined by 1.25 percentage points , whereas the figure for middle @-@ aged savers actually increased by about 1.5 percentage points .
apart from accounting for the global divergence in savings rates , tight credit constraints in China might explain the country &apos;s high , and rising , savings rate - especially as the large rise in national savings is attributable mostly to household savings .
this would mean that China &apos;s much @-@ publicized effort to boost domestic consumption might in fact call for appropriate credit @-@ market reforms .
US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke &apos;s notion of a &quot; global savings glut &quot; is a commonly cited explanation for falling world interest rates .
credit constraints in fast @-@ growing developing economies may be the reason why the glut emerged in the first place .
Europe &apos;s Path to Disunity
Munich - The motto of the United States of America is : &quot; e pluribus unum &quot; ( Out of many , one ) .
the European Union &apos;s motto is &quot; In varietate concordia , &quot; which is officially translated as &quot; United in diversity . &quot;
it is difficult to express the differences between the US and the European model any more clearly than this .
the US is a melting pot , whereas Europe is a mosaic of different peoples and cultures that has developed over the course of its long history .
that difference raises the question of whether it is worth striving for a United States of Europe - a concept that many refuse to accept , because they do not believe in the possibility of a unified European identity .
a single political system like that of the US , they insist , presupposes a common language and a single nationality .
perhaps the idea of a United States of Europe , the dream of post @-@ war children like me , can never be realized .
but I am not so sure .
after all , deeper European integration and the creation of a single political system offer solid , practical advantages that do not require a common identity or language .
these advantages include the right to move freely across borders , the free movement of goods and services , legal certainty for cross @-@ border economic activities , Europe @-@ wide transportation infrastructure , and , not least , common security arrangements .
banking regulation is the most topical area in which collective action makes sense .
if banks are regulated at the national level , but do business internationally , national regulatory authorities have a permanent incentive to set lax standards to avoid driving business to other countries and to lure it from them instead .
regulatory competition thus degenerates into a race to the bottom , since the benefits of lax regulation translate into profits at home , while the losses lie with bank creditors around the world .
there are many similar examples from the fields of standards , competition policy , and taxation that are applicable here .
so , fundamental considerations speak for deeper European integration , extending even to the creation of a single European state .
the danger of following such a path always lies in the fact that collective decision @-@ making bodies not only provide services that are useful to everybody , but also may abuse their power to redistribute resources among the participating countries .
even democratic bodies are not immune to this danger .
on the contrary , they make it possible for majorities to exploit minorities .
to counter this threat , democratic bodies invariably need special rules to protect minorities , such as the requirement of qualified majority voting or unanimous decision @-@ making .
the decisions taken by the European Central Bank are a particularly dramatic example of this problem , taken as they are by a simple majority of a body that is not even democratically elected .
the ECB &apos;s decisions lead to a massive redistribution of wealth and risk among the eurozone &apos;s member states , as well as from stable countries &quot; taxpayers , who have little stake in the crisis , to global investors directly affected by it .
the ECB has been providing virtually all of its refinancing credit to the eurozone &apos;s five crisis @-@ stricken countries : Italy , Spain , Portugal , Greece , and Ireland .
all the money circulating in the eurozone originated in these five countries and was then largely used to buy goods and assets in the northern member countries and redeem foreign debt taken from them .
the US Federal Reserve would never be allowed to conduct such a regionally imbalanced policy .
the Fed cannot even provide credit to specific regions , let alone states on the verge of bankruptcy ( for example , California ) .
and now European Council President Herman Van Rompuy , backed by most of the troubled eurozone countries , is again proposing Eurobonds and debt @-@ mutualization schemes .
these ideas go well beyond the American system .
the kind of fiscal integration and centralized power that they would require do not even remotely resemble those in place in the US .
Van Rompuy &apos;s proposals are extremely dangerous and could destroy Europe .
the path toward a union based on joint liabilities , against the wishes of large parts of its population , is not leading to a federal state in the true sense of the term - that is , to an alliance of equals , who freely decide to unite and promise to protect each other .
nor can this path lead to a United States of Europe , simply because a large part of Europe refuses to follow it .
Europe is not identical with the eurozone .
it contains many more countries than those that use the euro .
as useful as the euro could be for Europe &apos;s prosperity if its obvious flaws were corrected , the way that the eurozone is now developing will split the EU and undermine the idea of unity in diversity .
the assertion that the eurozone could be transformed into a United States of Europe is no longer convincing .
the path toward joint liability is far more likely to lead to a deep rift within Europe , because turning the eurozone into a transfer and debt union that can prevent the insolvency of any of its members would require more central power than currently exists in the US .
austerity and demoralization
new HAVEN - The high unemployment that we have today in Europe , the United States , and elsewhere is a tragedy , not just because of the aggregate output loss that it entails , but also because of the personal and emotional cost to the unemployed of not being a part of working society .
austerity , according to some of its promoters , is supposed to improve morale .
British Prime Minister David Cameron , an austerity advocate , says he believes that his program reduces &quot; welfare dependency , &quot; restores &quot; rigor , &quot; and encourages the &quot; the doers , the creators , the life @-@ affirmers . &quot;
likewise , US Congressman Paul Ryan says that his program is part of a plan to promote &quot; creativity and entrepreneurial spirit . &quot;
some kinds of austerity programs may indeed boost morale .
monks find their life &apos;s meaning in a most austere environment , and military boot camps are thought to build character .
but the kind of fiscal austerity that is being practiced now has the immediate effect of rendering people jobless and filling their lives with nothing but a sense of rejection and exclusion .
one could imagine that a spell of unemployment might be a time of reflection , reestablishment of personal connections , and getting back to fundamental values .
some economists even thought long ago that we would be enjoying much more leisure by this point .
John Maynard Keynes , in his 1930 essay &quot; Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren , &quot; speculated that , within a hundred years , that is , by 2030 , higher incomes would reduce the average workday to a mere three hours , for a total workweek of only 15 hours .
while there are still 17 years to go , it appears that Keynes was way off the mark .
so was Robert Theobald , who , in his 1963 book Free Men and Free Markets questioned the public &apos;s repugnance toward high unemployment .
he asserted that &quot; we can have meaningful leisure rather than destructive unemployment , &quot; and that we do not need &quot; a whirling @-@ Dervish economy dependent on compulsive consumption . &quot;
but finding something satisfying to do with our time seems inevitably to entail doing some sort of work : &quot; meaningful leisure &quot; wears thin after a while .
people seem to want to work more than three hours a day , even if it is assembly @-@ line work .
and the opportunity to work should be a basic freedom .
unemployment is a product of capitalism : people who are no longer needed are simply made redundant .
on the traditional family farm , there was no unemployment .
austerity exposes the modern economy &apos;s lack of interpersonal connectedness and the morale costs that this implies .
work @-@ sharing might keep more people marginally attached to their jobs in an economic slump , thereby preserving their self @-@ esteem .
instead of laying off 25 % of its workforce in a recession , a company could temporarily reduce workers &quot; hours from , say , eight per day to six .
everyone would remain employed , and all would come a little closer to Keynes &apos;s ideal .
some countries , notably Germany , have encouraged this approach .
but work @-@ sharing raises technical problems if increased suddenly to deal with an economic crisis like the one we are now experiencing .
these problems preclude the sudden movement toward the ideal of greater leisure that thinkers like Keynes and Theobald proclaimed .
one problem is that workers have fixed costs , such as transportation to work or a health plan , that do not decline when hours ( and thus pay ) are cut .
their debts and obligations are similarly fixed .
they could have bought a smaller house had they known that their hours would be reduced , but now it is difficult to downsize the one that they did buy .
another problem is that it may be difficult to reduce everyone &apos;s job by the same amount , because some jobs scale up and down with production , while others do not .
in his book Why Wages Don &apos;t Fall During a Recession , Truman Bewley of Yale University reported on an extensive set of interviews with business managers involved with wage @-@ setting and layoffs .
he found that they believed that a serious morale problem would result from reducing everyone &apos;s hours and pay during a recession .
then all employees would begin to feel as if they did not have a real job .
in his interviews with managers , he was told that it is best ( at least from a manager &apos;s point of view ) if the pain of reduced employment is concentrated on a few people , whose grumbling is not heard by the remaining employees .
employers worry about workplace morale , not about the morale of the employees they lay off .
their damaged morale certainly affects others as a sort of externality , which matters very much ; but it does not matter to the firm that has laid them off .
we could perhaps all be happy working fewer hours if the decline reflected gradual social progress .
but we are not happy with unemployment that results from a sudden fiscal crisis .
that is why sudden austerity cannot be a morale builder .
for morale , we need a social compact that finds a purpose for everyone , a way to show oneself to be part of society by being a worker of some sort .
and for that we need fiscal stimulus - ideally , the debt @-@ friendly stimulus that raises taxes and expenditures equally .
the increased tax burden for all who are employed is analogous to the reduced hours in work @-@ sharing .
but , if tax increases are not politically expedient , policymakers should proceed with old @-@ fashioned deficit spending .
the important thing is to achieve any fiscal stimulus that boosts job creation and puts the unemployed back to work .
end Austerity Now
Edinburgh - In recent weeks , talk about a budding recovery in the eurozone has gained traction , with key indices pointing to expansion in the core countries - data that many are citing as evidence that austerity is finally working .
money @-@ market funds from the United States are returning , albeit cautiously , to resume funding of European bank debt .
even Goldman Sachs is now bullishly piling into European equities .
but is a recovery really underway ?
cynics recall that a European recovery was supposed to take hold as early as the fourth quarter of 2010 , and that every International Monetary Fund projection since then has predicted recovery &quot; by the end of the year . &quot;
instead , GDP has collapsed , with the Spanish and Italian economies expected to contract by close to 2 % this year .
Portugal &apos;s economy is set to shrink by more than 2 % , and Greece &apos;s output will fall by more than 4 % .
moreover , unemployment in the eurozone has skyrocketed to an average rate of roughly 12 % , with more than 50 % youth unemployment in the periphery countries implying a long @-@ term loss of talent and erosion of the tax base .
and , despite the spike in unemployment , productivity growth in the eurozone is decidedly negative .
more significant , over the last year , the public debt / GDP ratio rose by seven percentage points in Italy , 11 in Ireland , and 15 in Portugal and Spain .
if the sine qua non of recovery via austerity is the stabilization and reduction of debt , the cynics &quot; case appears to have been made .
against this background , the return of US investors to provide short @-@ term dollar funding for European bank debt smacks of a desperate hunt for yield that relies on European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s promise to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to save the euro .
as for Goldman &apos;s equity play , as bond @-@ market guru Bill Blain put it , &quot; the words &apos; buy cheap , sell a bit dearer on the up , and then dump and run &quot; spring to mind . &quot;
in fact , any talk of recovery is premature until the losses incurred by austerity are recouped .
as it stands , every country that has implemented an austerity program without imposing losses on private creditors has more debt now than when it started .
for example , according to official estimates , Spain &apos;s public debt , which amounted to only about 36 % of GDP when the crisis began , has almost tripled - and the actual figure may be much higher .
more telling , the countries that cut expenditure the most experienced the largest bond @-@ yield spikes and the most significant debt growth .
the explanation for this is simple .
when a country gives up its monetary sovereignty , its banks are effectively borrowing in a foreign currency , making them exceptionally vulnerable to liquidity shocks , like that which sparked turmoil in Europe &apos;s banking system in 2010 @-@ 2011 .
the government , unable to print money to bail out the banks or increase export competitiveness through currency devaluation , is left with only two options : default or deflation ( austerity ) .
austerity &apos;s underlying logic is that budget cuts , by reducing the debt burden and restoring confidence , ultimately enhance stability and support growth .
but , when countries pursue austerity simultaneously with their main trading partners , overall demand plummets , causing all of their economies to contract and , in turn , increasing their debt / GDP ratios .
but the problem with austerity in the eurozone is more fundamental : policymakers are attempting to address a sovereign @-@ debt crisis , though the real problem is a banking crisis .
with Europe &apos;s banking system triple the size and twice as leveraged as its US counterpart , and the ECB lacking genuine lender @-@ of @-@ last @-@ resort authority , the sudden halt in capital flows to peripheral countries in 2009 created a liquidity @-@ starved system that was too big to bail out .
as holders of euro @-@ denominated assets recognized this situation , they turned to the ECB for insurance ( which the ECB could not deliver under its previous president , Jean @-@ Claude Trichet , whose leadership was defined by his commitment to maintaining price stability ) .
investors &quot; subsequent efforts to price in the risk of a eurozone breakup - not the volume of sovereign debt - caused bond yields to spike .
but the financial @-@ market turmoil fueled a panic among eurozone leaders , leading them to misdiagnose the malady and prescribe the wrong medicine , which has served only to generate new symptoms .
while Draghi &apos;s promise , embodied by the ECB &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program - as well as its long @-@ term refinancing operation and emergency liquidity assistance program - has bought time and lowered yields , the eurozone &apos;s banking crisis persists .
eurozone leaders must recognize that spending cuts will do nothing to stabilize the balance sheets of core @-@ country banks that are over @-@ exposed to peripheral countries &quot; sovereign debt .
until Europe rejects austerity in favor of a growth @-@ oriented approach , all signs of recovery will prove illusory .
Erdoğan &apos;s Authoritarian quackery
Tbilisi - Why do conspiracy theories and general charlatanism so often receive their strongest support from the world &apos;s dictators ?
sure , dictators are almost always oddballs themselves , but that cannot be all there is to it .
in fact , it is worth asking whether quackery is a necessary feature of authoritarian rule .
the latest evidence that it is can be found at the heart of Turkey &apos;s current economic crisis .
Turkey is saddled with debt and its currency , the lira , is plunging , yet the central bank has been all but prohibited from defending the currency by raising interest rates , because Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan believes that raising interest rates actually causes inflation .
the economics profession would beg to differ .
but Erdoğan , as with much else , is not inclined to listen .
on the contrary , to force the central bank to pursue his bizarre monetary policy , Erdoğan has installed his utterly unqualified son @-@ in @-@ law , Berat Albayrak , as the country &apos;s Minister of Finance and Treasury .
having grown up in the Soviet Union , I am particularly sensitive to the impact of perverse scientific theories on a society .
Joseph Stalin rejected Mendelian genetics ( the fundamental laws of heredity ) and even Darwin &apos;s theory of evolution in favor of the bogus theories of Trofim Lysenko , the Soviet biologist who believed that human traits were acquired , not inherited .
with Stalin &apos;s backing , Lysenko - whose spurious agricultural research doomed perhaps millions of people to starvation - sent Soviet biology down a two @-@ decade @-@ long rabbit hole of lunacy .
Nikita Khrushchev may have overturned Stalinism , but he was no less a prisoner of theoretical perversity .
he not only supported the Lysenko theories , but also believed ideologically hardened engineers and geologists who insisted that the rules of communism could defy the laws of nature .
they told him that Soviet atomic bombs could be used to reverse the course of major rivers , allowing water to be redirected toward agriculture , rather than being &quot; wasted &quot; by flowing into the Arctic Sea .
Russia &apos;s experience with lethal authoritarian charlatanism is hardly unique .
Hitler &apos;s embrace of demented racial &quot; science &quot; delivered the world into darkness and led , almost inexorably , to the Holocaust .
the perversion of reason was so normalized under Nazi rule that Josef Mengele &apos;s grotesque human experiments could be discussed at scientific conferences just like any other medical research .
the same paranoia @-@ fueled attraction to bogus science often motivates authoritarians to endorse conspiracy theories .
Erdoğan , who has long been convinced that external forces are relentlessly plotting against his regime , is no exception .
in Erdoğan &apos;s eyes , these malevolent forces usually act through the financial markets .
so far , he has refrained from claiming outright that these markets act at the behest of &quot; world Jewry &quot; ( the architects , many Turkish Islamists believe , of the 1908 Young Turk revolution and the secular republic that arose after World War I ) .
but his core supporters hear the dog whistle behind his condemnations of the forces of finance - forces that now seem to be demanding higher interest rates .
but perhaps no current leader is more susceptible to misbegotten science and half @-@ baked conspiracy theories than the US president and wannabe authoritarian , Donald Trump .
it should never be forgotten that Trump wormed his way into US politics by promoting the racist &quot; birther &quot; argument , which claimed that then @-@ President Barack Obama was not born in the US and therefore did not qualify for the office he held .
since entering the White House , the lunacy has only grown .
on more than 20 occasions , Trump has tweeted about a potential link between vaccines and autism .
that link - first promoted by a disgraced British doctor and a former Playboy playmate - has been conclusively refuted by the scientific community .
Trump also denies any link between human activity and climate change , again bucking the overwhelming scientific consensus .
and he insists , over the protests of countless economists , that trade deficits are a sign of US economic weakness .
according to Alan Levinovitz , a professor of religious studies at James Madison University , Trump uses capitalization in his tweets much as medical quacks and religious charlatans did in their efforts to bamboozle the public in centuries past .
it is by no means clear whether Trump himself knows the difference between real and fake .
he appears convinced that the FBI and the media are conspiring to bring down his presidency .
in this sense , Trump has taken what the historian Richard Hofstadter described as the &quot; paranoid style &quot; from the fringes of US politics into the mainstream .
perhaps a shared paranoid style is what draws Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin , who has continually argued that the world is conspiring to deprive Russia of the great @-@ power status it deserves .
in any case , as Turkey &apos;s crisis starkly demonstrates , even the most deeply held of misbegotten beliefs eventually run up against reality .
&quot; the world is what it is , &quot; as the late V.S. Naipaul put it at the start of his novel A bend in the River . &quot; those who are nothing , or allow themselves to become nothing , have no place in it . &quot;
the same could be said of authoritarian leaders .
those who refuse to recognize the world as it is - whether they are viewing it from Turkey , the US , Venezuela , or a host of other countries - eventually lose the position that their denial of reality was supposed to protect .
why Bannon Had to Go
Washington , DC - In many , if not most , US administrations , some figure emerges who convinces the press that the president couldn &apos;t function without him ( it &apos;s yet to be a her ) .
the indispensable aide is , indeed , one of the most well @-@ worn tropes of the modern presidency .
Karl Rove was &quot; Bush &apos;s Brain &quot; ; Harry Hopkins held Franklin Delano Roosevelt &apos;s prolific White House team together ; Bill Moyers appeared on a magazine cover as &quot; Johnson &apos;s Good Angel . &quot;
without such a figure , the story inevitably goes , the administration would be a mess , if not a disaster .
as often as not , the trope is invented or encouraged by the particular indispensable figure .
journalists usually fall for the story , regardless of how well @-@ founded it is : it clarifies everything , and it gives them something to write about .
the indispensable aide is only too happy to reveal some dramatic story about how he saved the day , devised some particularly ingenious idea , or prevented some terrible mistake .
but , as often as not , the soi @-@ disant crucial figure oversteps .
in the Reagan White House , Don Regan , who succeeded James Baker as Chief of Staff , fancied himself the prime minister : he inserted himself into photos of Reagan with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev , was rude to lesser beings ( including reporters ) , and made the fatal mistake of hanging up on Nancy Reagan , who was dedicated to looking after her Ronny .
Regan was soon out .
presidents themselves aren &apos;t particularly fond of reading how some super @-@ smart aide saved their bacon .
all presidents have healthy egos - if others are so smart , why aren &apos;t they president ?
the wise president @-@ elect identifies a peacock and avoids the species from the start , or knows how to keep its feathers in check .
Barack Obama was plenty pleased with himself , with reason , but such was his dignity that no super @-@ aide emerged during his presidency .
it didn &apos;t occur to his advisers to try to outshine him .
Stephen Bannon wasn &apos;t particularly wise as a White House aide - he couldn &apos;t contain his inner peacock - and Donald Trump &apos;s ego is particularly fragile .
both are or were misfits in their roles .
Trump had spent his business life surrounded by family and flunkies : no stockholders or vice chairmen with their own ambitions .
the two men were a mismatch made in White House hell .
as a candidate , Trump went with his instincts , and his instinct in the 2016 presidential race was that blue @-@ collar workers and others who feared for their economic future needed their own victims , be they Mexican immigrants or billionaire bankers .
a wall - phantasmagorical or not - would keep out the &quot; bad people &quot; Mexico was &quot; sending us . &quot;
as it happened , of all the people around Trump , Bannon most matched these views .
a person like Bannon - who presents himself as a learned figure and confirms one &apos;s own brilliance - is a person one wants to have close by .
Trump is essentially a &quot; whatever works &quot; kind of guy .
once elected , he brought in billionaires to populate his cabinet , and so far seems to have gotten away with telling his supporters that really rich people are needed to run the country .
Bannon , on the other hand , wrapped himself in what might be loosely termed a philosophy , which consisted of a nihilistic anger toward any &quot; establishment . &quot;
but his was faux populism : while Bannon politically championed blue @-@ collar workers , he lived on the millions he had attained from a stint at Goldman Sachs and through a fortunate investment in the TV comedy series &quot; Seinfeld . &quot;
he also flourished with backing from the billionaire Mercer family .
the Mercers , who made their fortune through the high @-@ tech genius of patriarch Robert Mercer and a hedge fund he led , fund Breitbart News , a far @-@ right website formerly edited by Bannon that promotes ultra @-@ nationalism and white supremacy , with a whiff of anti @-@ Semitism .
Bannon &apos;s ostensibly radical views were dressed up in a fancy set of principles embroidered with name @-@ drops of far @-@ out thinkers . in trade and immigration , for example , Bannon &apos;s acquired philosophy aligned with Trump &apos;s political opportunism ( Trump &apos;s more liberal , often Democrat @-@ backing former self is another story ) .
it was a mistake to see Bannon as Pygmalion to Trump &apos;s Galatea , or , as some did , as the Trump White House &apos;s Rasputin .
Bannon reinforced the nationalist inclination that led Trump to overrule his daughter Ivanka and his economic advisers by withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement .
and Bannon intruded on foreign policy by getting himself put on the National Security Council for a while , until two of the generals in Trump &apos;s administration - National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster and John Kelly ( now the chief of staff ) - got him removed .
( Bannon was believed to be behind the recent push to force out McMaster , mainly by suggesting that he is &quot; anti @-@ Israel . &quot; )
but Bannon &apos;s role as genius @-@ without @-@ portfolio - in which Trump indulged him , until Kelly arrived and clarified chains of command - was his undoing .
without any defined responsibilities , he intruded where he wished - and ended up with a lot of enemies .
he had plenty of time to fight internal battles by feeding reporters stories about his White House rivals , though he would switch someone ( for example , former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus ) from rival to friend , as convenient .
Bannon was a troublemaker as much as a policymaker - and the two roles didn &apos;t mesh .
Trump also began to see Bannon as a &quot; leaker . &quot;
and Trump &apos;s White House is all too leaky : many who work there let reporters know that they have , at best , mixed feelings about working for Trump , but believe the better part of valor is to stay and protect the country from his leadership .
Bannon &apos;s braggadocio took him to the most dangerous terrain on which to confront Trump : the president &apos;s obsession with his election victory .
the ambiguity of winning the Electoral College vote ( not , as he has falsely claimed , by the greatest margin since Reagan ) but losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes , dogs Trump .
that &apos;s why he invented millions of &quot; illegal &quot; voters and had maps printed showing the states he won in red - covering most of the territory of the United States - even suggesting to at least one reporter that his newspaper run the map on the paper &apos;s front page .
suggestions by Bannon that he played a major role in Trump &apos;s election victory were poisonous to the relationship between the two men .
and so this White House misfit finally had to go .
now that Bannon is gone , however , he will hurl missives from his new @-@ old perch at Breitbart , to which he returned the same day as his announced departure .
and Trump will still be Trump .
why Barack Obama ?
new YORK - The winner of America &apos;s presidential election will inherit a perfect storm of problems , both economic and international .
he will face the most difficult opening @-@ day agenda of any president since - and I say this in all seriousness - the man who saved the Union , Abraham Lincoln .
but a more instructive precedent is 1933 , when Franklin Roosevelt offered inspiring rhetoric and &quot; bold experimentation &quot; to a nation facing economic meltdown and a breakdown in public confidence .
for me , the choice is simple - and not only because I am , by temperament and history , a Democrat .
the long and intense political campaign has revealed huge differences in the two candidates &quot; positions , style , and personal qualities . and the conclusion seems clear .
judgment .
John McCain has shown throughout his career a penchant for risk @-@ taking ; in his memoirs , he proudly calls himself a gambler .
his selection of Sarah Palin , a charismatic but spectacularly unqualified candidate , as his running mate , is just the most glaring of many examples of the real McCain .
his bravery in combat attests to his patriotism , courage , and toughness , but his judgment has been found sorely lacking time and time again over his career .
Barack Obama is tough , too , but in a different way .
no one should underestimate how difficult it was to travel his road , against incredible odds , to the cusp of the presidency .
but where McCain is impulsive and emotional , Obama is low @-@ key and unemotional .
he makes his judgments in a calm and methodical manner ; McCain &apos;s impulsiveness is anathema to Obama , and rightly so - one cannot play craps with history .
having seen so many political leaders falter under pressure , I prize this ability above most others .
and Barack Obama has it .
the economy .
the first priority of the new president will be the economy and the financial crisis .
since the crisis hit , Obama has been calm and , indeed , presidential .
he consulted the best advisory team in the nation , weighed each course of action carefully , and then issued a series of precise , calm statements .
meanwhile , McCain has veered bizarrely , issuing contradictory statements , &quot; suspending &quot; his campaign ( while continuing to campaign ) , and urging that the first debate be canceled ( when it was all the more needed ) .
advantage Obama .
foreign policy .
the most explicit disagreements between the candidates are over Iraq , Iran , and Russia .
but there are deeper differences .
McCain &apos;s positions , with the notable exception of climate change , suggest that he would simply try to carry out George W. Bush &apos;s policies more effectively .
Obama offers a different approach to foreign policy .
by starting to draw down combat troops in Iraq , Obama would change the image and policies of America immediately .
by engaging Iran in talks that would cover not only the nuclear issue but other aspects of Iran &apos;s destabilizing role in the region , he would either reach agreements that lowered the dangers from Iran , or he would mobilize a stronger international coalition to isolate Iran .
either way , engaging Iran is the right policy , and it is hard to understand why Bush and McCain have continued to hold out against such an obvious change of course , which , if carried out with firmness , will not compromise American or Israeli national security .
on Russia since its invasion of Georgia , Obama and his running mate , Joe Biden ( who was the first member of Congress to visit Georgia after the invasion ) , emphasize helping Georgia rebuild its economy and maintain its independence in the face of a continuing Russian campaign against it .
McCain , on the other hand , wants to punish Russia by such actions as expelling it from the G @-@ 8 .
such measures may ultimately be necessary , but they will not help Georgia survive as an independent democracy .
moreover , even after the outrage in Georgia , there are issues of common interest - such as energy , climate change , and Iran - on which the West and the Kremlin must cooperate .
this was true even during the Cold War , and remains true today , yet McCain seems not to recognize it .
leadership .
in the end , all presidential elections come down to the intangibles of leadership .
the vote for a president is a sort of private contract directly between each voter and his or her preferred choice .
who do you want to see on your television screen for the next four years ?
to whom do you wish to entrust the nation &apos;s fate ? &amp;
here again , the contrasting styles of Obama and McCain offer a clear choice between a calm and confident man and a highly emotional one , between a major change in the nation &apos;s direction and a minor one , between a conciliatory style and a more combative one .
effectiveness .
finally , in a year in which the Democrats are certain to increase their majority in both houses of Congress , an Obama victory would offer the Democrats control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1994 , and with it the possibility of legislative achievement after years of stalemate .
after so many years of polarization at home and unilateralism abroad , the choice for president seems clear .
why Big Banks Will Get Bigger
Florence - severe banking crises bring painful and long @-@ lasting disruptions . but they also lead to surprises .
the lessons learned in the immediate aftermath bear little relationship to the eventual outcome .
there are immediate and obvious answers to the question of who was to blame , but they rarely correspond with the new shape of the financial landscape that ultimately emerges .
the crisis that began in 2007 originated in the sub @-@ prime mortgage sector in the United States , and in US banks that were &quot; too big to fail , &quot; prompting many observers at the outset to predict the end of American financial capitalism .
but the banks that were most affected were elsewhere , and the long @-@ term winners will be a few American banks - including some of the most notoriously weak banks - which will get bigger as a result of the crisis .
fueled by the injection of taxpayers &quot; money , American capitalism is back in force .
the explanation of why the obvious lessons of the crisis are being not drawn lies in the curious character of financial activity .
banking is inherently competitive ; but at the same time , it is not an industry where competition ever worked very well .
the core of financial activity depends on reputation , information networks , and the ability to make markets as well as trade on them .
the result is that there are indisputable advantages to being big , as well as the disadvantages that have become obvious over the past two years .
the market tends to be dominated by a relatively small number of firms .
in the old days , when banking was stable and regulated securely in a national setting , three or four leading banks tended to form an oligopoly : Barclays , Lloyds , Midland , and National Westminster in the United Kingdom ; Commerzbank , Deutsche , and Dresdner in Germany .
there were always suspicions of formal or informal banking cartels , which would agree on conditions and interest rates .
regulators generally turned a blind eye to these suspicions .
in the 1990 &quot; s and 2000 &quot; s , internationalization promised to produce a new landscape , in which a small handful of banks would once again divide up a single global market .
banks maneuvered to get the best position to take advantage of financial globalization , which usually meant locating themselves where the regulatory regime was least restrictive .
banks got much bigger very quickly , and bigness brought problems .
as they grew , banks found it difficult to manage the multiplicity of their divergent activities .
they were beset with incompatible computer software systems , rogue employees , and the need to account for the different national cultures in which they were now operating .
almost inevitably , the biggest banks in the world got into trouble .
in the 1990 &quot; s , the largest banks were mostly Japanese . who now remembers Daiichi Kangyo ?
the financial crisis has produced a new answer to where the greatest competitive advantages lie .
from banks &quot; perspective , the most obvious lesson was the need for a strong national government to bear the potential costs of a rescue .
it is no longer best to be subject to the most favorable regulatory regime , but to be where the state has the deepest pockets .
very large banks in small territories with small @-@ scale governments are vulnerable .
the US is big enough to handle behemoths like Bank of America or Citigroup .
China can handle its large banks , even if they have large portfolios of poor credits .
European banks are in a more precarious situation .
Ireland and Iceland have become notorious cases where a financial sector metastasized and destroyed the host country .
even in France and Germany , large and internationally active banks potentially exceed the government &apos;s capacity to mount a rescue .
in addition , there is the complexity of disentangling which country is responsible for what part of a rescue , when , for instance , Central European banks are controlled by an Austrian bank that is bought by a German bank that is then bought by an Italian bank .
as a result , the big transnational institutions are lobbying hard for a pan @-@ European approach to banking supervision and regulation ( and implicitly for fiscal bailouts should that supervision and regulation fail ) .
in the case of the banks that required state rescues , European competition rules are requiring divestment and downsizing .
institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland , which for a time in 2009 headed the list of the world &apos;s largest international banks , are being pruned by the EU &apos;s Directorate General for Competition .
even the stronger banks are being pressed to increase their capital reserves .
in most cases , this means that they will continue to cut back on lending , worsening the impact of the financial crisis on the rest of the economy .
by contrast , in the US , the government pushed big banks into buying up smaller and vulnerable banks , and is now doing everything it can to press them to lend more .
government reactions are full of paradoxes .
the more we insist that a banking system should be competitive , the greater the risks that individual banks will take .
the more governments are prepared to step in , and the greater the resources of those governments , the more big banks and big countries will be favored .
the last 20 years of globalization saw the emergence of small , open economies as global leaders .
the next 20 years will see a different globalization , in which the winners are large , powerful countries that mobilize government resources in the interest of creating winners in the race for financial supremacy .
why bipartisanship is Good Politics
London - bipartisanship seems to have taken a drubbing in Washington since President Barack Obama got to the White House .
like most recent American presidents , Obama campaigned on a promise to work with his political opponents for the greater good of the country .
bill Clinton said much the same thing before he was elected , and then spent his first term in a knockdown fight with Newt Gingrich &apos;s Republican majority in Congress , and his second term fighting off impeachment .
George W. Bush also said that he would reach out to those who disagreed with him .
he then turned into the most partisan and ideological president of modern times , egged on by his vice @-@ president , Dick Cheney .
Obama already appears to have gone further in the pursuit of bipartisanship than his predecessors .
his selection of Republicans for key posts - including retaining Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense - has raised a few eyebrows among his supporters .
but , above all , he has tried hard to secure Republican support for his efforts to prevent the economy from disappearing into a deep recessionary hole .
only three maverick Republican Senators went along with Obama &apos;s proposals to get the plan accepted .
and in the House of Representatives , the Republicans unanimously rejected every amendment , every compromise , and every courtesy that he offered .
some commentators suggest that Obama made a bad mistake .
first , he promised bipartisanship , but got heavily rebuffed .
second , he and his administration were so busy trying to build consensus that they watered down some of the vital ingredients of the stimulus package , and failed to defend it robustly from Republican attack .
there may sometimes be a downside in trying to woo your opponents .
when they are plainly wrong , why let them off the hook ?
here we have had Republicans criticizing an increase in America &apos;s budget deficit after doubling America &apos;s national debt in the Bush presidency &apos;s eight years .
moreover , Republicans &quot; belief that only tax cuts , not public spending , will delivery recovery is a sad example of blinkered ideology .
but there are more positive reasons for Obama effort at bipartisanship .
in any democratic system of checks and balances , leaders usually require coalitions in order to get what they want done .
moreover , a consensual style is good politics .
most voters - certainly swing voters , who usually decide elections - do not like partisan battles as much as some politicians and their supporters do .
after all , the wise , the moderate , and the floating voter do not switch on the radio to listen to archconservatives like the American broadcaster Rush Limbaugh .
when things get tough in politics , as will happen in most of the world as we struggle with the impact of the global recession , every sensible government will try to hang on to the benefit of doubt . it is the most important attribute in politics .
citizens know that running a country , especially in a time like this , is tough .
they are prepared to spare governments from too much criticism , if they think they are trying to do what is right for everyone .
they bridle at a government that must do unpopular things and that also looks narrow and mean @-@ spirited .
there is also a lot to be said for making political argument more civil .
Ronald Reagan had a strong ideological bent .
he reshaped American politics , pulling the center firmly to the right .
but he did so without ever seeming to despise his opponents or disparage their intentions .
Obama &apos;s aides have confessed that he modeled his own election program on the sunny and optimistic decency of the Republican actor .
civility in politics is not simply political confectionery .
a leader who respects his or her opponents is more likely to earn respect himself than one who doubts their patriotism and resents their criticism .
one reason for the widespread respect felt for Nelson Mandela is that years of imprisonment did not embitter him .
Jawaharlal Nehru was hugely popular because he was known to cherish free speech , take seriously the views of his critics , and defend their right to disagree with him .
his role in establishing enduring democracy in India , despite the tensions of caste , ethnicity , religion , and regional loyalties , made him one of the towering figures of the twentieth century .
so my own hope is that Obama will not be dissuaded from trying to work with his opponents , to build consensus , and to deal courteously even with those whose views he may thoroughly dislike .
personally , I do not think that those whose philosophy deplores the whole idea of government , except when it is required to bail out businesses or banks , and who purport to offer a better future by stitching together the shreds and tatters of policies that helped produce today &apos;s economic disaster , will have much respect or support from voters .
even in Washington , there is not much to be said for being partisan , unpopular , and wrong .
blockchain &apos;s Broken Promises
new YORK - The financial @-@ services industry has been undergoing a revolution .
but the driving force is not overhyped blockchain applications such as Bitcoin . it is a revolution built on artificial intelligence , big data , and the Internet of Things .
already , thousands of real businesses are using these technologies to disrupt every aspect of financial intermediation .
dozens of online @-@ payment services - PayPal , Alipay , WeChat Pay , Venmo , and so forth - have hundreds of millions of daily users .
and financial institutions are making precise lending decisions in seconds rather than weeks , thanks to a wealth of online data on individuals and firms .
with time , such data @-@ driven improvements in credit allocation could even eliminate cyclical credit @-@ driven booms and busts .
similarly , insurance underwriting , claims assessment and management , and fraud monitoring have all become faster and more precise .
and actively managed portfolios are increasingly being replaced by passive robo @-@ advisers , which can perform just as well or better than conflicted , high @-@ fee financial advisers .
now , compare this real and ongoing fintech revolution with the record of blockchain , which has existed for almost a decade , and still has only one application : cryptocurrencies .
blockchain &apos;s boosters would argue that its early days resemble the early days of the Internet , before it had commercial applications .
but that comparison is simply false . whereas the Internet quickly gave rise to email , the World Wide Web , and millions of viable commercial ventures used by billions of people , cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin do not even fulfill their own stated purpose .
as a currency , Bitcoin should be a serviceable unit of account , means of payments , and a stable store of value . it is none of those things .
no one prices anything in Bitcoin .
few retailers accept it . and it is a poor store of value , because its price can fluctuate by 20 @-@ 30 % in a single day .
worse , cryptocurrencies in general are based on a false premise .
according to its promoters , Bitcoin has a steady @-@ state supply of 21 million units , so it cannot be debased like fiat currencies .
but that claim is clearly fraudulent , considering that it has already forked off into three branches : Bitcoin Cash , Litecoin , and Bitcoin Gold . besides , hundreds of other cryptocurrencies are invented every day , alongside scams known as &quot; initial coin offerings , &quot; which are mostly designed to skirt securities laws .
so &quot; stable &quot; cryptos are creating money supply and debasing it at a much faster pace than any major central bank ever has .
as is typical of a financial bubble , investors are buying cryptocurrencies not to use in transactions , but because they expect them to increase in value .
indeed , if someone actually wanted to use Bitcoin , they would have a hard time doing so .
it is so energy @-@ intensive ( and thus environmentally toxic ) to produce , and carries such high transaction costs , that even Bitcoin conferences do not accept it as a valid form of payment .
until now , Bitcoin &apos;s only real use has been to facilitate illegal activities such as drug transactions , tax evasion , avoidance of capital controls , or money laundering .
not surprisingly , G20 member states are now working together to regulate cryptocurrencies and eliminate the anonymity they supposedly afford , by requiring that all income- or capital @-@ gains @-@ generating transactions be reported .
after a crackdown by Asian regulators this month , cryptocurrency values fell by 50 % from their December peak .
they would have collapsed much more had a vast scheme to prop up their price via outright manipulation not been rapidly implemented .
but , like in the case of the sub @-@ prime bubble , most US regulators are still asleep at the wheel .
since the invention of money thousands of years ago , there has never been a monetary system with hundreds of different currencies operating alongside one another .
the entire point of money is that it allows parties to transact without having to barter .
but for money to have value , and to generate economies of scale , only so many currencies can operate at the same time .
in the US , the reason we do not use euros or yen in addition to dollars is obvious : doing so would be pointless , and it would make the economy far less efficient .
the idea that hundreds of cryptocurrencies could viably operate together not only contradicts the very concept of money ; it is utterly idiotic .
but so , too , is the idea that even a single cryptocurrency could substitute for fiat money .
cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value , whereas fiat currencies certainly do , because they can be used to pay taxes .
fiat currencies are also protected from value debasement by central banks committed to price stability ; and if a fiat currency loses credibility , as in some weak monetary systems with high inflation , it will be swapped out for more stable foreign fiat currencies or real assets .
as it happens , Bitcoin &apos;s supposed advantage is also its Achilles &apos;s heel , because even if it actually did have a steady @-@ state supply of 21 million units , that would disqualify it as a viable currency .
unless the supply of a currency tracks potential nominal GDP , prices will undergo deflation .
that means if a steady @-@ state supply of Bitcoin really did gradually replace a fiat currency , the price index of all goods and services would continuously fall .
by extension , any nominal debt contract denominated in Bitcoin would rise in real value over time , leading to the kind of debt deflation that economist Irving Fisher believed precipitated the Great Depression .
at the same time , nominal wages in Bitcoin would increase forever in real terms , regardless of productivity growth , adding further to the likelihood of an economic disaster .
clearly , Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represent the mother of all bubbles , which explains why every human being I met between Thanksgiving and Christmas of 2017 asked me if they should buy them .
scammers , swindlers , charlatans , and carnival barkers ( all conflicted insiders ) have tapped into clueless retail investors &quot; FoMo ( &quot; fear of missing out &quot; ) , and taken them for a ride .
as for the underlying blockchain technology , there are still massive obstacles standing in its way , even if it has more potential than cryptocurrencies .
chief among them is that it lacks the kind of basic common and universal protocols that made the Internet universally accessible ( TCP @-@ IP , HTML , and so forth ) .
more fundamentally , its promise of decentralized transactions with no intermediary authority amounts to an untested , Utopian pipedream .
no wonder blockchain is ranked close to the peak of the hype cycle of technologies with inflated expectations .
so , forget about blockchain , Bitcoin , and other cryptocurrencies , and start investing in fintech firms with actual business models , which are slogging away to revolutionize the financial @-@ services industry .
you won &apos;t get rich overnight ; but you &apos;ll have made the smarter investment .
did the Bankers Do It ?
new DELHI - Few areas of economic activity in the United States are more politicized than housing finance .
yet the intellectual left has gone to great lengths to absolve regulators , government lending mandates , and agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of any responsibility for the housing boom and the subsequent bust .
the rationale is clear : if these officials , institutions , and policies were held accountable , the reform agenda would necessarily shift from regulating greedy bankers and their bonuses to asking broader questions .
might government mandates contribute to bad behavior by private players ?
can regulators be trusted to make appropriate trade @-@ offs between financial stability and mandates that have wide political support ?
indeed , can central bankers be truly independent ?
unquestioning acceptance of a greater government role in taming markets would , in short , give way to asking whether that role can sometimes be part of the problem .
the left has had an easy task in dominating the debate , partly because the intellectual right &apos;s attempt to place all the blame for the crisis on government is thoroughly implausible .
it is far more defensible and correct to argue that everyone - bankers , households , regulators , and politicians - contributed to ( and took credit for ) the boom while it lasted , only to point fingers at one another when it collapsed .
but bankers &quot; political tin ear in the aftermath of the crisis - first taking public bailouts and then paying themselves huge bonuses as if nothing had changed - ensured that they got the lion &apos;s share of the blame , with everyone else willing to pose as their unwitting victims .
as a result , the public @-@ policy response has been dominated by &quot; the bankers did it &quot; narrative .
the risk is that this approach is incomplete - and thus unlikely to be effective .
it is therefore refreshing to see a careful econometric study take on an assertion by Paul Krugman , perhaps the most influential left @-@ leaning US economist , that &quot; the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 was irrelevant to the subprime boom . &quot;
the CRA instructs federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage the institutions that they regulate to help the communities in which they are chartered to meet their credit needs , while also conforming to &quot; safe and sound &quot; standards .
in practice , regulators measure the volume of lending to CRA target tracts - poor areas with median income less than 80 % of the median income of the local community - as well as to low @-@ income and minority borrowers in non @-@ CRA tracts to verify compliance with the Act .
the left has dismissed any claim that the CRA played a role in the housing boom by pointing out that it was enacted in 1977 , while the subprime boom played out in the early 2000 &quot; s .
but this ignores the possibility that regulators may have started to enforce the CRA rigorously only later .
to enforce the statute , regulators periodically examine banks for CRA compliance .
to hone in on the &quot; regulatory enforcement &quot; effect , the recent study compares the behavior of banks that are undergoing examination ( which takes place over several quarters ) to that of banks that are not undergoing examination in a particular tract in a particular month .
the findings are clear .
compared to banks that are not undergoing examination , the volume of loans by banks in the six quarters surrounding a CRA examination is 5 % higher , and these loans are 15 % more likely to be delinquent one year after origination .
in other words , banks undergoing examination lend more and make riskier loans - and these findings are even more pronounced in CRA @-@ eligible tracts .
good econometric studies examine secondary effects to persuade readers that the main effect is what it is .
regulators &quot; primary tool to enforce compliance was their authority to reject non @-@ CRA @-@ compliant banks &quot; requests for new branches or mergers .
during the subprime boom , large banks were more likely to want to expand , and thus had greater incentive to comply .
the study finds that CRA lending by larger banks does indeed respond more to a CRA examination .
at the height of the lending frenzy ( 2004 @-@ 2006 ) , the study finds that banks loaned even more in response to an examination , and that the outcomes were even worse .
the authors speculate that easier loan securitization may have made risky CRA @-@ compliant loans seem less costly .
finally , like all good studies , this one explains why the authors more careful analysis produces results that differ from those in previous studies .
because of the way it is structured , the study only suggests a lower bound on the effects of CRA compliance .
it focuses on the differential impact of the CRA on banks undergoing examination and those not undergoing examination .
in fact , all banks are likely to have upped their CRA @-@ compliant lending .
the study cannot measure this increase .
there is room in economics for grand speculation - some part intuition , some part common sense , and some part ideology .
if economists were to wait for careful studies before offering opinions about policy , we would never have anything timely to say .
and it is certainly better to have some economic intuition guiding policy than none at all .
but there is a danger that the public mistakes speculation for truth , only because of the speculator &apos;s credentials and assertiveness .
studies like this one are useful in setting the record straight .
more broadly , the study suggests that we should move beyond blaming the bankers .
we must recognize that in the desire to broaden home ownership , essential checks and balances broke down .
households , politicians , and regulators were also complicit .
as we go about the process of reform , we should bear in mind that the only thing worse than fighting the last war is fighting the wrong last war .
why Border Walls Fail
Honolulu - Call this the Year of Border Walls .
in 2015 , Estonia , Hungary , Kenya , Saudi Arabia , and Tunisia all announced or began the construction of barriers on their frontiers .
we may live in an era of globalization , but much of the world is increasingly focused on limiting the free movement of people .
at the end of World War II , there were only five border walls around the world .
today , according to Elisabeth Vallet of the University of Quebec at Montreal , there are 65 , three @-@ quarters of them built in the past 20 years .
and in the United States , Republican presidential candidates are promising more .
the Republican frontrunner , Donald Trump , has repeatedly proposed building a wall along the entire border with Mexico .
and on a Sunday morning talk show , another Republican candidate , Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker , described building a wall on the US @-@ Canada border as &quot; a legitimate issue for us to look at . &quot;
and yet existing border walls are neither cheap nor effective .
Israel &apos;s wall in the West Bank cost more than $ 1 million per mile to construct .
according to US Customs and Border Protection , building and maintaining the existing 670 miles of border fencing on the US @-@ Mexico border would cost $ 6.5 billion over the barrier &apos;s expected 20 @-@ year life cycle . at this price , fortifying the remaining 1,300 miles of the Mexico border would cost more than $ 12.6 billion .
erecting a wall along the 5,525 @-@ mile border with Canada would cost almost $ 50 billion and would cut through an airport runway , an opera house , homes , and businesses that currently straddle the border .
nor is there much evidence that border walls work as intended .
to be sure , prisons demonstrate that short , well @-@ guarded walls can be extremely effective at preventing movement .
but even prison walls are only as effective as the guards who ensure that they are not breached , and guards can be susceptible to bribes .
the recent escape of the drug cartel leader Joaquin &quot; El Chapo &quot; Guzman from a Mexican prison highlights another vulnerability of border walls : tunnels .
since 1990 , the US Border patrol has found 150 tunnels beneath the US @-@ Mexico border .
those with money will always be able to cross borders using fake documents , bribes , or innovative infrastructure .
indeed , fortified frontiers are most effective at stopping poor migrants and refugees .
and even then , rather than preventing migrants from entering , fortifications all too often funnel them toward more dangerous crossing points .
the result is a mounting toll of predictable deaths .
the International Organization for Migration estimates that from 2005 to 2014 , some 40,000 people died attempting to cross a border .
unlike prison perimeters , borders can be thousands of miles long , which makes them difficult to monitor properly .
the US employs more than 20,000 Border patrol agents ; but even if they were all on duty at the same time , each would need to guard a 1,700 @-@ foot section of the border .
of course , equipment like cameras , motion sensors , drones , helicopters , and vehicles allow agents to watch long sections of the border .
but the necessity of monitoring border walls points to one of the fundamental truths about them : historically , most have proved to be pretty useless .
the most famous sections of the Great Wall of China were overrun within a few decades of their construction .
when Germany invaded France in WWII , it simply went around the Maginot Line .
the Berlin Wall fell within 30 years of its construction .
indeed , border guards and their equipment can be equally effective without a physical barrier .
at best , walls and fences only slow people down , making them a poor investment from a security standpoint .
they are similarly ineffective from a military perspective .
missiles and airplanes can fly over them and tanks can smash through them .
and yet , despite their high cost and low efficacy , walls remain popular among policymakers and politicians .
they provide imposingly tangible evidence that something is being done about migration .
high @-@ tech surveillance and boots on the ground may be more effective at preventing people from crossing a border , but a wall can be used as a political prop .
if Trump ever builds his wall , he should build a really nice one , like the Great Wall of China .
then one day it might become a popular tourist attraction - and finally serve a useful purpose .
football Fury
Paris - Who would have thought it ?
there they were , Brazilians , protesting outside football stadiums against their country hosting the World Cup in 2014 - and this even as their national team was thrashing Spain in the final of the Confederations Cup .
it was as if Catholics were to protest outside the Vatican against picking a new Pope .
what cuisine is to the French , soccer is to Brazilians : a matter of the highest national pride .
regardless of their economic , racial , or political differences , all Brazilians are uplifted by having the best team in the world , winning the World Cup many times , and inventing and reinventing &quot; the beautiful game . &quot;
staging the next World Cup in Brazil , as well as the Olympic Games in 2016 , even though the football tournament alone will cost up to $ 13 billion , seems a logical move .
Rio de Janeiro is where soccer belongs .
so what possessed the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Brazilian male who told reporters : &quot; we don &apos;t need the World Cup .
we need education , better health services , more humane police . &quot;
many people feel the same way .
have millions of Brazilians suddenly lost their passion for the game ?
if so , it is not the game itself that they have forsaken , but rather the kind of game that football has become : a billion @-@ dollar business , a prestige object for louche plutocrats , and an extravagant showpiece for corrupt governments and international sporting organizations .
football was once a popular sport , rooted in local communities .
local working @-@ class boys played for local clubs that inspired fierce loyalty among fans .
football chauvinism always contained an edge of violence , for it often included an ethnic , religious , or class component : Protestants versus Catholics ( in Scotland ) ; &quot; Jewish &quot; clubs ( in Amsterdam , Berlin , London , and Budapest ) , taunted by fans who opposed the &quot; Yids &quot; ; posh clubs ( like Galatasaray in Istanbul ) and resolutely proletarian sides ( West ham in London ) ; clubs that took pride in a strong regional identity ( Barcelona ) ; and clubs that were close to the centers of power ( Real Madrid ) .
some clubs were financed by industrial corporations in order to promote loyalty among their workers : Philips sponsored the Dutch club PSV Eindhoven , for example , while Fiat played the same role for Italy &apos;s Juventus .
but , regardless of the sponsorship or the location , fans felt close to most of the clubs , as well as to their national teams .
they were part of people &apos;s &quot; identity . &quot;
this is still true to some extent , but something crucial has changed : football , like other types of commerce , has gone global .
thanks to new ownership rules , cable television , product endorsements , and other business @-@ related factors , there are probably more supporters of Manchester United in China than there are in the United Kingdom , let alone in the city of Manchester .
football teams are now like multinational franchises , with coaches and players from all over the world .
but this alone does not account for the kind of alienation from the game expressed by the Brazilian protesters .
the worldwide reach of football was preceded by that of the Olympic Games , and it is here where we should turn to understand the corruption of globalized sports .
unlike football , the Olympics were always closely associated with elites : amateur athletes recruited from universities , and so on .
the father of the modern Olympic Games , Baron de Courbertin , was a French aristocrat who promoted sports to reinvigorate the men of France after their defeat in the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1871 .
his aim for the Olympic Games was to embody a noble ideal of world peace and brotherhood through athletic competition .
how easily this ideal could be corrupted by distinctly ungentlemanly politics was already clear in 1936 , when Coubertin &apos;s doddering speech about peace and fair play was played over the loudspeakers of the Olympic Stadium in Berlin , while Hitler and his henchmen raised their arms to salute the Nazi flag .
but even without noisome politics , the sheer amount of money required to stage the Olympic Games - the building contracts for stadiums , transport infrastructure , and hotels , together with all the other commercial razzmatazz - was bound to produce a culture of bribery and kickbacks .
an international elite of Olympic officials arose , living in a self @-@ contained bubble of wealth and privilege .
I once had occasion to watch these men as they trooped in and out of first @-@ class hotels in an Asian capital , sleek figures in gold @-@ buttoned blazers .
it was striking to see how often the most prosperous @-@ looking representatives came from the world &apos;s poorest countries .
football is now like the Olympics ( or Formula 1 racing ) , except that even more money is involved .
football clubs have become the status symbols of newly rich tycoons from Russia or the Middle East , and international competitions , especially the World Cup , have become occasions to bolster the prestige , and sometimes even the legitimacy , of national governments .
such events reinforce the tendency of modern political regimes , dictatorships as well as democracies , to measure themselves in monumental building projects - giant new stadiums , gargantuan shopping malls , huge conference halls - which are sometimes needed , but often are not .
as a result , developers , architects , politicians , tycoons , and international sporting officials are now in charge of the beautiful game .
this adds to their power , wealth , and prestige .
but once they have staged their spectacles , at vast expense to the host country , they move on .
this is especially galling in countries where much of the population is poor and deprived of decent schools or proper medical services .
millions of Brazilians have made clear where their priorities lie .
they haven &apos;t fallen out of love with football .
on the contrary , by protesting against the grotesque manipulation of the modern game , they are trying to take it back .
BRICS Without mortar
Cambridge - Last month , China &apos;s new president , Xi Jinping , chose Moscow for his first foreign visit .
he and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a number of agreements and then traveled to Durban , South Africa , for the fifth &quot; BRICS &quot; summit , where they joined with the leaders of India , Brazil , and South Africa to announce the creation of a new development bank that could challenge the dominance of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund .
the five leaders &quot; speeches referred to a shifting world order , and Xi said &quot; the potential of BRICS development is infinite . &quot;
it looked as if the BRICS had finally come of age .
three years ago , I was skeptical about the BRICS . and , despite the recent summit &apos;s apparent success , I still am .
nearly 12 years ago , Jim O &apos;Neill , then the chief economist for Goldman Sachs , coined the term &quot; BRIC &quot; to describe the &quot; emerging markets &quot; of Brazil , Russia , India , and China .
from 2000 to 2008 , these four countries &quot; share of global output rose rapidly , from 16 % to 22 % ( in purchasing power parity terms ) , and their economies performed better than average in the subsequent global recession .
for investors , that outcome justified the creation of the catchy acronym .
but then a strange thing happened : the investors &quot; creature came to life .
in 2009 , the four countries met for the first time in Russia in an effort to forge an international political organization .
South Africa joined the bloc in late 2010 primarily for political reasons .
as O &apos;Neill recently told China Daily , &quot; South Africa is quite fortunate enough to be in the group , as , economically , it is rather small compared to the others . &quot;
moreover , its economic performance has been relatively sluggish , with a growth rate of just 2.3 % last year .
indeed , while the BRICS may be helpful in coordinating certain diplomatic tactics , the term lumps together highly disparate countries .
not only is South Africa miniscule compared to the others , but China &apos;s economy is larger than those of all of the other members combined .
likewise , India , Brazil , and South Africa are democracies , and occasionally meet in an alternative forum that they call &quot; IBSA . &quot;
and , while the large autocracies , Russia and China , find it diplomatically advantageous to tweak the Americans , both have different but crucial relationships with the United States .
and both have worked to thwart efforts by India , Brazil , and South Africa to become permanent members of the United Nations Security Council .
as I wrote three years ago , in analytical terms , it makes little sense to include Russia , a former superpower , with the developing economies .
Russia lacks diversified exports , faces severe demographic and health problems , and , in former President Dmitri Medvedev &apos;s words , &quot; greatly needs modernization . &quot;
little has changed since Putin returned to the presidency last year .
while economic growth benefited from the dramatic growth in oil and gas prices during the last decade , other competitive industries have yet to emerge , and the country now faces the prospect of declining energy prices .
while it aims to maintain 5 % annual growth , its economy was relatively flat last year .
if Russia &apos;s power resources seem to be declining , Brazil &apos;s appear to be more impressive , given it has a territory nearly three times the size of India &apos;s , a 90 % literacy rate , and triple the per capita income of India ( and nearly twice that of China ) .
but , in the three years since my earlier assessment , Brazil &apos;s performance has slipped : annual economic growth has slowed from 7.5 % in 2010 to 1 % last year , with a 3.5 % rate expected in 2013 .
like Brazil , India experienced a spurt of output growth after liberalizing its economy in the 1990 &quot; s ; indeed , until a few years ago , GDP growth was approaching Chinese @-@ style rates .
this year , however , output is expected to rise by a relatively sluggish 5.9 % .
unless it improves its infrastructure and literacy rate ( particularly for women ) , India is unlikely to catch up with China .
so , should we take today &apos;s BRICS more seriously than the BRICs of three years ago ?
tellingly , the meeting in Durban failed to produce any details of the structure of the proposed new development bank , suggesting that little progress had been made in the year since the BRICS &quot; last meeting in New Delhi , where the plan was announced .
in fact , despite a commitment to launch &quot; formal negotiations &quot; to establish the bank , disagreements about the size and shares of the bank &apos;s capital have not been resolved .
that lack of unity is symptomatic of the BRICS members &quot; underlying incompatibilities .
in political terms , China , India , and Russia are vying with each other for power in Asia .
and , in economic terms , Brazil , India , and South Africa are concerned about the effects of China &apos;s undervalued currency on their economies .
three years ago , I wrote that , &quot; BRIC is not likely to become a serious political organization of like @-@ minded states . &quot;
the BRICS &quot; most recent meeting has given me no reason to revise that assessment .
why Capital Flows uphill
London - At first , it seems difficult to grasp : global capital is flowing from poor to rich countries .
emerging @-@ market countries run current @-@ account surpluses , while advanced economies have deficits .
one would expect fast @-@ growing , capital @-@ scarce ( and young ) developing countries to be importing capital from the rest of world to finance consumption and investment .
so , why are they sending capital to richer countries , instead ?
China is a case in point .
with its current @-@ account surplus averaging 5.5 % of GDP in 2000 @-@ 2008 , China has become one of the world &apos;s largest lenders .
despite its rapid growth and promising investment opportunities , the country has persistently been sending a significant portion of its savings overseas .
and China is not alone .
other emerging markets - including Brazil , Russia , India , Mexico , Argentina , Thailand , Indonesia , Malaysia , and the Middle Eastern oil exporters - have all increased their current @-@ account surpluses significantly since the early 1990 &quot; s .
collectively , capital @-@ scarce developing countries are lending to capital @-@ abundant advanced economies .
many observers believe that these global imbalances reflect developing economies &quot; financial integration , coupled with underdevelopment of domestic financial markets .
according to this view , these countries &quot; demand for assets cannot be met - in terms of both quantity and quality - at home , so they deploy part of their savings to countries like the US , which can offer a more diverse array of quality assets .
while plausible , this argument suggests that , as financial markets improve over time in developing countries , the global imbalances are bound to shrink .
but such a reversal is nowhere in sight .
why ?
a crucial dimension of globalization has been trade liberalization .
for China , foreign trade as a percentage of GDP soared from 25 % in 1989 to 66 % in 2006 , largely owing to its admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 .
most of what China and other developing countries produce and export are labor @-@ intensive goods such as textiles and apparel .
this has allowed advanced economies , in turn , to produce and export more capital @-@ intensive , higher @-@ value @-@ added products .
globalization of trade enabled countries to tap the efficiency gains that specialization in their sectors of comparative advantage has brought about .
with a slight mental stretch , one can imagine that what a country produces and trades may affect its savings and investment decisions .
an economy in which the main productive activity is berry picking , for example , has little need for investment and capital accumulation .
its laborers earn wages , consume , and save part of that income .
since the production process requires little capital , there is no demand for domestic investment - and thus no savings vehicles .
instead , the only way to save is by purchasing capital abroad - in economies with capital @-@ intensive production and demand for investment .
this economy will always export its savings .
that may be an extreme example , but it illustrates a more general point about how merchandise trade can influence financial flows .
countries that produce and export more labor @-@ intensive goods - perhaps owing to increased trade openness , or faster labor @-@ force and productivity growth , all of which are true of China - may experience a rise in saving , but a less @-@ than @-@ equivalent increase in demand for capital .
rich countries , by contrast , are able to export more capital @-@ intensive goods , and thus have a greater need for investment .
so they may be importing more capital - resulting in a greater current @-@ account deficit - simply because they are producing more capital @-@ intensive goods .
with developing countries - in particular , China , India , and the ex @-@ Soviet bloc - bringing almost 1.5 billion workers into the world economy since the early 1990 &quot; s , it is not difficult to understand the potential impact of this effect .
after all , much of this labor force was absorbed by labor @-@ intensive industries that eventually churned out products exported to the rest of the world .
indeed , that massive addition of labor helped to drive down the relative price of labor @-@ intensive goods , which fell by roughly 15 % between 1989 and 2008 .
as developing countries increased their labor @-@ intensive production and exports , their current @-@ account surpluses rose - by almost 3.6 percentage points , on average , between 1989 @-@ 1993 and 2002 @-@ 2006 .
China &apos;s current @-@ account surplus increased by almost 11 percentage points over the same period , India &apos;s by 2.5 percentage points , and Russia &apos;s by seven percentage points .
these countries , as well as other large surplus economies , such as Brazil , Saudi Arabia , and Iran , all experienced a simultaneous increase in the labor content of exports .
this pattern contrasts with that of the United States and many other advanced countries , which have experienced a deterioration of their current @-@ account balances as their production and exports have become more capital @-@ intensive .
many might doubt the view that China is exporting more labor @-@ intensive goods , rather than upgrading its exports on the capital- and skill @-@ intensity ladder .
but trade data suggest the opposite , perhaps because China &apos;s accession to the WTO led to tariff reductions that released more labor @-@ intensive production .
in fact , trade data may underestimate the true extent of China &apos;s labor intensity andoverstate the capital and skill intensity of China &apos;s exports .
China has witnessed rapid growth in the processing trade : assembling intermediate inputs - imported from countries like the US and Japan - that have high capital and skill content .
so , while the exports of these final goods may count towards China &apos;s own capital and skill content , the country &apos;s real role was only in the labor @-@ intensive process of assembly .
a country &apos;s production structure may very well determine how much capital it supplies and how much it needs .
so the fact that capital may flow towards rich countries that produce and export more capital @-@ intensive goods should not be so puzzling , after all .
why China Can &apos;t Adjust
CLAREMONT , CALIFORNIA - China &apos;s current economic slowdown has no shortage of causes : Europe &apos;s financial turmoil , sputtering recovery in the United States , and weak domestic investment growth , to name the most commonly cited factors .
since exports and investment account , respectively , for 30 % and 40 % of China &apos;s GDP growth , its economy is particularly vulnerable to weakening external demand and accumulation of non @-@ performing loans caused by excessive and wasteful spending on fixed assets .
but China &apos;s vulnerability to these factors , as serious as they are , is symptomatic of deeper institutional problems .
until these underlying constraints are addressed , talk of a new consumption @-@ based growth model for China , reflected in the government &apos;s recently approved 12th Five @-@ Year Plan , can be no more than lip service .
after all , China &apos;s major trading partners , international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , and senior Chinese officials themselves have long recognized the structural vulnerabilities caused by excessive investment and low household consumption .
and , for nearly a decade , China has been urged to undertake reforms to redress these economic patterns , which have undermined the welfare of ordinary Chinese and strained the global trading system .
the best @-@ known feature of China &apos;s macroeconomic imbalances is heavy dependence on exports for growth , which is typically attributed to weak domestic demand : as a middle @-@ income country , China lacks the purchasing power to consume the goods that it produces .
with nearly unlimited access to advanced @-@ country markets , China can tap into global external demand and raise its GDP growth potential , as it has done for the past two decades .
if this view is right , the solution is straightforward : China can correct its imbalances by increasing its citizens &quot; incomes ( by cutting taxes , raising wages , or increasing social spending ) , so that they can consume more , thereby reducing the economy &apos;s dependence on exports .
indeed , nearly all mainstream economists prescribe this approach for China .
but there is another explanation for China &apos;s excessive export dependence , one that has more to do with the country &apos;s poor political and economic institutions .
specifically , export dependence partly reflects the high degree of difficulty of doing business in China .
official corruption , insecure property rights , stifling regulatory restraints , weak payment discipline , poor logistics and distribution , widespread counterfeiting , and vulnerability to other forms of intellectual @-@ property theft : all of these obstacles increase transaction costs and make it difficult for entrepreneurs to thrive in domestic markets .
by contrast , if China &apos;s private firms sell to Western multinationals , such as Wal @-@ Mart , Target , or Home Depot , they do not have to worry about getting paid .
they can avoid all of the headaches that they would have encountered at home , because well @-@ established economic institutions and business practices in their export markets protect their interests and greatly reduce transaction costs .
the Chinese economy &apos;s institutional weakness is reflected in international survey data .
the World Bank publishes an annual review of &quot; the ease of doing business &quot; for 183 countries and sub @-@ national units .
in its June 2011 survey , China was ranked 91st , behind Mongolia , Albania , and Belarus .
it is particularly difficult to start a business in China ( 151st ) , pay taxes ( 122nd ) , obtain construction permits ( 179th ) , and get electricity ( 115th ) .
faced with such a hostile environment , Chinese private entrepreneurs have been forced to engage in &quot; institutional arbitrage &quot; - taking advantage of efficient Western economic institutions to expand their business ( most export @-@ oriented businesses are owned by private entrepreneurs and foreign firms ) .
unfortunately , as China has already claimed a large share of the world &apos;s merchandise exports ( 10.4 % in 2010 ) and economic stagnation in the West is constraining external demand , this strategy can no longer work .
but reorienting their businesses toward the Chinese domestic market requires far more than government policies that put more money in consumers &apos; pockets .
in order to enjoy the same low transaction costs that they have in exporting , China &apos;s entrepreneurs need a much better business environment : an effective legal system , a sound regulatory framework , a government that protects their brands by fighting intellectual @-@ property theft , dependable logistics and distribution networks , and a graft @-@ resistant bureaucracy .
China cannot create such an environment quickly .
in essence , the Chinese government must transform a predatory state into a nurturing one , and treat private entrepreneurs as creators of wealth rather than targets of extraction .
in nearly all other countries , such a transformation was accomplished by establishing the rule of law and / or moving from autocracy to democracy .
the impossibility of sustaining growth in the absence of the rule of law and political accountability presents the Chinese Communist Party with an existential dilemma .
ever since it crushed the pro @-@ democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989 , the party has vowed not to surrender its political monopoly .
the investment boom and the globalization dividend of the last two decades allowed the Party to have its cake and eat it - maintaining its rule on the basis of economic prosperity , while failing to establish the institutions critical to sustaining such prosperity .
today , this is no longer possible .
so in a sense , the Chinese bubble - as much an intellectual and political bubble as an economic one - has burst .
as China &apos;s economic deceleration exposes its structural vulnerabilities and flawed policies , the much @-@ hyped notion of &quot; Chinese exceptionalism &quot; - that China can continue to grow without the rule of law and the other essential institutions that a modern market economy presupposes - is proving to be nothing but a delusion .
the Lessons of the China @-@ India War
new DELHI - This month marks the 50th anniversary of China &apos;s military attack on India , the only foreign war that communist @-@ ruled China has won .
yet that war failed to resolve the disputes between the world &apos;s two most populous countries , and its legacy continues to weigh down the bilateral relationship .
while their economic heft is drawing increasing international attention , their underlying strategic rivalry over issues ranging from land and water to geopolitical influence in other regions usually attracts less notice .
the international importance of the China @-@ India relationship reflects the fact that together they account for 37 % of humanity .
although they represent markedly different cultures and competing models of development , they share a historical similarity that helps shape both countries &quot; diplomacy : each freed itself from colonial powers around the same time .
throughout their histories , the Indian and Chinese civilizations were separated by the vast Tibetan plateau , limiting their interaction to sporadic cultural and religious contacts ; political relations were absent .
it was only after China &apos;s annexation of Tibet in 1950 @-@ 1951 that Han Chinese troops appeared for the first time on India &apos;s Himalayan frontiers .
just over a decade later , China surprised India &apos;s ill @-@ prepared army by launching a multi @-@ pronged attack across the Himalayas on October 20 , 1962 .
Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai publicly said that the war was intended &quot; to teach India a lesson . &quot;
taking an enemy by surprise confers a significant tactical advantage in war , and the invasion inflicted an immense psychological and political shock on India that greatly magnified the initial military advances that China achieved .
China &apos;s blitzkrieg created a defeatist mindset in India , forcing its army to retreat to defensive positions .
India , fearing unknown consequences , even shied away from employing its air power , although the Chinese military lacked effective air cover for its advancing forces .
after more than a month of fighting , China declared a unilateral ceasefire from a position of strength , having seized Indian territory .
the Chinese simultaneously announced that they would begin withdrawing their forces on December 1 , 1962 , vacating their territorial gains in the eastern sector ( where the borders of India , Myanmar , Tibet , and Bhutan converge ) but retaining the areas seized in the western sector ( in the original princely state of Jammu and Kashmir ) .
these withdrawal parameters Meshed with China &apos;s pre @-@ war aims .
just as Mao Zedong started his invasion of Tibet while the world was preoccupied with the Korean War , so he chose a perfect time to invade India , as recommended by the ancient strategist Sun Tzu .
the attack coincided with a major international crisis that brought the United States and the Soviet Union within a whisker of nuclear war over the stealthy deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba .
China &apos;s unilateral ceasefire coincided with America &apos;s formal termination of its naval blockade of Cuba , marking the end of the missile crisis .
Mao &apos;s shrewd timing ensured India &apos;s isolation from sources of international support .
throughout the invasion , the international spotlight was on the potential US @-@ Soviet nuclear showdown , not on the bloody war raging in the Himalayan foothills .
India &apos;s humiliating rout hastened the death of its prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru ; but it also set in motion the country &apos;s military modernization and political rise .
fifty years later , tensions between India and China are rising again amid an intense geopolitical rivalry .
their entire 4,057 @-@ kilometer border - one of the longest in the world - remains in dispute , without a clearly defined line of control in the Himalayas .
this situation has persisted despite regular Chinese @-@ Indian talks since 1981 .
in fact , these talks constitute the longest and most futile negotiating process between any two countries in modern history .
during a 2010 visit to New Delhi , Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stated bluntly that sorting out the border disputes &quot; will take a fairly long period of time . &quot;
if so , what does China ( or India ) gain by continuing the negotiations ?
as old wounds fester , new issues have begun roiling bilateral relations .
for example , since 2006 China has initiated a new territorial dispute by claiming the eastern sector ( the Austria @-@ size Arunachal Pradesh state ) , from which its forces withdrew in 1962 , describing it as &quot; Southern Tibet . &quot;
a perceptible hardening of China &apos;s stance toward India since then is also reflected in other developments , including Chinese strategic projects and the country &apos;s military presence in the Pakistani @-@ held portion of Kashmir , a region where the disputed borders of India , China , and Pakistan converge .
Indian defense officials have reported increased military incursions by Chinese troops in recent years .
in response , India has been beefing up its military deployments along the border to prevent any Chinese land grab .
it has also launched a crash program to improve its logistical capabilities by constructing new roads , airstrips , and advanced landing stations along the Himalayas .
the larger strategic rivalry between the world &apos;s largest autocracy and its biggest democracy has also sharpened , despite their fast @-@ rising trade .
in the past decade , bilateral trade has risen more than 20 @-@ fold , to $ 73.9 billion , making it the only area in which bilateral relations have thrived .
far from helping to turn the page on old disputes , this commerce has been accompanied by greater Sino @-@ Indian geopolitical rivalry and military tension .
booming bilateral trade is no guarantee of moderation between countries .
although China set out to teach India a &quot; lesson , &quot; the 1962 war failed to achieve any lasting political objectives and only embittered bilateral relations .
the same lesson is applicable to the Sino @-@ Vietnamese context : in 1979 , China replicated the 1962 model by launching a surprise blitzkrieg against Vietnam that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping admitted was designed to &quot; teach a lesson . &quot;
after 29 days , China ended its invasion , claiming that Vietnam had been sufficiently chastised . but the lesson that Deng seems to have drawn from the PLA &apos;s poor performance against Vietnam is that China , like India , needed to modernize every aspect of its society .
China is Not collapsing
London - One question has dominated the International Monetary Fund &apos;s annual meeting this year in Peru : will China &apos;s economic downturn trigger a new financial crisis just as the world is putting the last one to bed ?
but the assumption underlying that question - that China is now the global economy &apos;s weakest link - is highly suspect .
China certainly experienced a turbulent summer , owing to three factors : economic weakness , financial panic , and the policy response to these problems .
while none on its own would have threatened the world economy , the danger stemmed from a self @-@ reinforcing interaction among them : weak economic data leads to financial turmoil , which induces policy blunders that in turn fuel more financial panic , economic weakness , and policy mistakes .
such self @-@ reinforcing financial feedback is much more powerful in transmitting global economic contagion than ordinary commercial or trade exposures , as the world learned in 2008 @-@ 2009 .
the question now is whether the vicious circle that began in China over the summer will continue .
a sensible answer must distinguish between financial perceptions and economic reality .
China &apos;s growth slowdown is not in itself surprising or alarming .
as the IMF noted , China &apos;s growth rate has been declining steadily for five years - from 10.6 % in 2010 to a projected rate of 6.8 % this year and 6.3 % in 2016 .
this deceleration was inevitable as China advanced from extreme poverty and technological backwardness to become a middle @-@ income economy powered by external trade and consumer spending .
it was also desirable , because rapid growth was hitting environmental limits .
even as the pace of growth slows , China is contributing more to the world economy than ever before , because its GDP today is $ 10.3 trillion , up from just $ 2.3 trillion in 2005 .
simple arithmetic shows that $ 10.3 trillion growing at 6 % or 7 % produces much bigger numbers than 10 % growth starting from a base that is almost five times smaller .
this base effect also means that China will continue to absorb more natural resources than ever before , despite its diminishing growth prospects .
yet China is causing high anxiety , especially in emerging countries , largely because financial markets have convinced themselves that its economy is not only slowing , but falling off a cliff .
many Western analysts , especially in financial institutions , treat China &apos;s official GDP growth of around 7 % as a political fabrication - and the IMF &apos;s latest confirmation of its 6.8 % estimate is unlikely to convince them .
they point to steel , coal , and construction statistics , which really are collapsing in several Chinese regions , and to exports , which are growing much less than in the past .
but why do the skeptics accept the truth of dismal government figures for construction and steel output - down 15 % and 4 % , respectively , in the year to August - and then dismiss official data showing 10.8 % retail @-@ sales growth ?
one reason can be found in the financier George Soros &apos;s concept of &quot; reflexivity . &quot;
Soros has argued for years that financial markets can create inaccurate expectations and then change reality to accord with them .
this is the opposite of the process described in textbooks and built into economic models , which always assume that financial expectations adapt to reality , not the other way round .
in a classic example of reflexivity , when China &apos;s stock @-@ market boom turned into July &apos;s bust , the government responded with a $ 200 billion attempt to support prices , closely followed by a small devaluation of the previously stable renminbi .
financial analysts almost universally ridiculed these policies and castigated Chinese leaders for abandoning their earlier pretenses of market @-@ oriented reforms .
the government &apos;s apparent desperation was seen as evidence that China was in far greater trouble than previously revealed .
this belief quickly shaped reality , as market analysts blurred the distinction between a growth slowdown and economic collapse .
in mid @-@ September , for example , when the private @-@ sector Purchasing Managers &quot; Index ( PMI ) came out at 47.0 , the result was generally reported along these lines : &quot; the index has now indicated contraction in the &#91; manufacturing &#93; sector for seven consecutive months . &quot;
in fact , Chinese manufacturing was growing by 5 @-@ 7 % throughout that period .
the supposed evidence was wrong because 50 is the PMI &apos;s dividing line not between growth and recession , but between accelerating and slowing growth .
indeed , for 19 out of the PMI &apos;s 36 months of existence , the value has been below 50 , while Chinese manufacturing growth has averaged 7.5 % .
exaggerations of this kind have undermined confidence in Chinese policy at a particularly dangerous time .
China is now navigating a complex economic transition that involves three sometimes @-@ conflicting objectives : creating a market @-@ based consumer economy ; reforming the financial system ; and ensuring an orderly slowdown that avoids the economic collapse often accompanying industrial restructuring and financial liberalization .
managing this trifecta successfully will require skillful juggling of priorities - and that will become much more difficult if Chinese policymakers lose international investors &quot; trust or , more important , that of China &apos;s own citizens and businesses .
vicious circles of economic instability , devaluation , and capital flight have brought down seemingly unbreakable regimes throughout history .
this probably explains the whiff of panic that followed China &apos;s tiny , but totally unexpected , devaluation of the renminbi .
the renminbi , however , has recently stabilized , and capital flight has dwindled , as evidenced by the better @-@ than @-@ expected reserve figures released by the People &apos;s Bank of China on October 7 .
this suggests that the government &apos;s policy of shifting gradually to a market @-@ based exchange rate may have been better executed than generally believed ; even the measures to support the stock market now look less futile than they did in July .
in short , Chinese economic management seems less incompetent than it did a few months ago .
indeed , China can probably avoid the financial meltdown widely feared in the summer .
if so , other emerging economies tied to perceptions about China &apos;s economic health should also stabilize .
the world has learned since 2008 how dangerously financial expectations can interact with policy blunders , turning modest economic problems into major catastrophes , first in the US and then in the eurozone .
it would be ironic if China &apos;s Communist leaders turned out to have a better understanding of capitalism &apos;s reflexive interactions among finance , the real economy , and government than Western devotees of free markets .
why China is Right on the Renminbi
Berkeley - After a period of high tension between the United States and China , culminating earlier this month in rumblings of an all @-@ out trade war , it is now evident that a change in Chinese exchange @-@ rate policy is coming .
China is finally prepared to let the renminbi resume its slow but steady upward march .
we can now expect the renminbi to begin appreciating again , very gradually , against the dollar , as it did between 2005 and 2007 .
some observers , including those most fearful of a trade war , will be relieved .
others , who see a substantially undervalued renminbi as a significant factor in US unemployment , will be disappointed by gradual adjustment .
they would have preferred a sharp revaluation of perhaps 20 % in order to make a noticeable dent in the US unemployment rate .
still others dismiss the change in Chinese exchange @-@ rate policy as beside the point .
for them , the Chinese current @-@ account surplus and its mirror image , the US current @-@ account deficit , are the central problem .
they argue that current @-@ account balances reflect national savings and investment rates .
China is running external surpluses because its saving exceeds its investment .
the US is running external deficits because of a national savings shortfall , which once reflected spendthrift households but now is the fault of a feckless government .
there is no reason , they conclude , why a change in the renminbi @-@ dollar exchange rate should have a first @-@ order impact on savings or investment in China , much less in the US .
there is no reason , therefore , why it should have a first @-@ order impact on the bilateral current @-@ account balance , or , for that matter , on unemployment , which depends on the same saving and investment behavior .
in fact , both sets of critics have it wrong .
China was right to wait in adjusting its exchange rate , and it is now right to move gradually rather than discontinuously .
the Chinese economy is growing at potential : forecasts put the prospective rate for 2010 at 10 % ; the first @-@ quarter flash numbers , at 11.9 % , show it expanding as fast as any economy can safely grow .
China successfully navigated the crisis , avoiding a significant slowdown , by ramping up public spending .
but , as a result , it now has no further scope for increasing public consumption or investment .
to be sure , building a social safety net , developing financial markets , and strengthening corporate governance to encourage state enterprises to pay out more of what they earn would encourage Chinese households to consume .
but such reforms take years to complete .
in the meantime , the rate of spending growth in China will not change dramatically .
as a result , Chinese policymakers have been waiting to see whether the recovery in the US is real .
if it is , China &apos;s exports will grow more rapidly .
and if its exports grow more rapidly , they can allow the renminbi to rise .
without that exchange @-@ rate adjustment , faster export growth would expose the Chinese economy to the risk of overheating .
but , with the adjustment , Chinese consumers will spend more on imports and less on domestic goods .
overheating having been avoided , the Chinese economy can keep motoring ahead at its customary 10 % annual pace .
evidence that the US recovery will be sustained is mounting .
as always , there is no guarantee .
but the latest data on sales of light vehicles , as well as the Institute of Supply Management &apos;s manufacturing index and the Bureau of Labor Statistics employment report , all point in this direction .
because the increase in US spending on Chinese exports will be gradual , it also is appropriate for the adjustment in the renminbi @-@ dollar exchange rate to be gradual . if China recklessly revalued its exchange rate by 20 % , as certain foreigners recommend , the result could be a sharp fall in spending on its goods , which would undermine growth .
moreover , gradual adjustment in the bilateral exchange rate is needed to prevent global imbalances from blowing out .
US growth will be driven by the recovery of investment , which fell precipitously during the crisis .
but , as investment now rises relative to saving , there is a danger that the US current @-@ account deficit , which fell from 6 % of GDP in 2006 to barely 2.5 % of GDP last year , will widen again .
renminbi appreciation that switches Chinese spending toward foreign goods , including US exports , will work against this tendency .
by giving American firms more earnings , it will increase corporate savings in the US .
and it will reconcile recovery in the US with the need to prevent global imbalances from again threatening financial stability .
Chinese officials have been on the receiving end of a lot of gratuitous advice .
they have been wise to disregard it .
in managing their exchange rate , they have gotten it exactly right .
China &apos;s Reform Anxiety
Beijing - Since 2010 , global financial circles have been obsessing about China &apos;s slowing economy .
but , while the country barely met the official target of 7.5 % annual GDP growth in the second quarter of this year - generating significant anxiety worldwide - China &apos;s government seemingly remains calm , showing no indication that it plans to launch yet another stimulus package .
do China &apos;s leaders really have the situation under control ?
in fact , the Chinese government &apos;s stance - based on Premier Li Keqiang &apos;s &quot; Likonomics , &quot; which prioritizes structural reform over rapid GDP growth - will prove to be in the best interests of China and the rest of the world .
China &apos;s structural problems - including restrictions on labor mobility , a rigid and risk @-@ laden financial system , and excessive reliance on government investment - are threatening its stability and economic development .
given that China &apos;s GDP growth rate remains respectable relative to the rest of the world , the need to emphasize structural reform is clear .
but , despite well @-@ intentioned statements and narrow gestures , China &apos;s new leadership has yet to establish a concrete , bold reform plan capable of resolving the economy &apos;s deep @-@ rooted problems .
for example , last February , the State Council announced plans to reform the hukou ( household registration ) system , which assigns legal residency according to a person &apos;s place of birth .
the system makes relocating very difficult , as those who do not manage to acquire local residency permits face major hurdles in gaining access to public services when they migrate to other provinces .
indeed , their children are even prohibited from taking college entrance exams .
the reform plan was supposed to improve the situation by allowing migrants in towns and small cities to acquire local residency permits more freely , while easing the requirements in medium @-@ sized cities .
but efforts to reform the system have been met with strong resistance , especially from local governments and residents , who fear the strain that unregulated migration to their cities will have on resources , employment , and services .
as a result , a genuine hukou reform strategy remains elusive .
similarly , the government has been slow to formulate and implement effective financial @-@ market reforms .
hopes were high early this year , when the State Council announced a strategy aimed at liberalizing the capital account , establishing a more flexible exchange @-@ rate policy , and opening the financial sector to domestic private capital .
but the government then heeded influential economists &quot; warnings of the risks of relaxing capital controls too hastily .
in fact , the opposite should be happening .
narrow policies like the government &apos;s recent credit tightening will make it difficult to direct financial resources to the real economy - one of the primary objectives of &quot; Likonomics . &quot;
genuine progress depends on Chinese leaders &quot; willingness to address the structural flaws - namely , the restrictions on domestic private capital - that are impeding the financial system &apos;s ability to channel savings to the most promising economic sectors .
despite several rounds of deregulation , it remains very difficult to establish private banks in China , and rules on non @-@ banking financial institutions are often unclear .
as a result , shadow banking , which provides capital at triple the cost implied by the official base interest rate , is flourishing - and generating significant uncertainty and risk .
although the government recently attempted to attract capital back to the official banking sector by eliminating the lending rate &apos;s lower bound , more substantial reform is needed - and that will likely have to wait until the interest rate on deposits is fully liberalized and the financial sector is open to private banks .
in many other areas , too , China &apos;s government either remains indecisive or is offering only rhetoric and small gestures .
for example , the devolution of some project @-@ approval powers to local governments will not solve the underlying problem of excessive state intervention in the economy ; on the contrary , it may even enhance the state &apos;s role by giving local governments more freedom to carry out investment projects .
China &apos;s leaders know what is wrong with the country &apos;s economy .
but , as their efforts over the last several months have highlighted , they are uncertain as to how to go about fixing it - a fact that is generating significant anxiety in financial markets and among the general public .
as senior Chinese officials gather for their annual summer meeting in Beidaihe , a coastal resort near Beijing , they must recognize the need for a bold plan for genuine structural reform .
otherwise , anxiety will eventually give rise to mistrust , making a comprehensive reform strategy even more difficult to implement .
is State Capitalism Winning ?
Cambridge - In the age @-@ old contest of economic @-@ growth models , state capitalism has seemed to be gaining the upper hand in recent years .
avatars of liberal capitalism like the United States and the United Kingdom continued to perform anemically in 2012 , while many Asian countries , relying on various versions of dirigisme , have not only grown rapidly and steadily over the last several decades , but have also weathered recent economic storms with surprising grace .
so , is it time to update the economics textbooks ?
in fact , economics does not say that unfettered markets are better than state intervention or even state capitalism .
the problems with state capitalism are primarily political , not economic .
any real @-@ world economy is riddled with market failures , so a benevolent and omnipotent government could sensibly intervene quite often .
but who has ever met a benevolent or omnipotent government ?
to understand the logic of state capitalism , it is useful to recall some early examples - not the socialist command economies or modern societies seeking to combat market failures , but ancient civilizations .
indeed , it seems that , like farming or democracy , state capitalism has been independently invented many times in world history .
consider the Greek Bronze Age , during which many powerful states , organized around a city housing the political elite , formed throughout the Mediterranean basin .
these states had no money and essentially no markets .
the state taxed agricultural output and controlled nearly all goods production .
it monopolized trade , and , in the absence of money , moved all of the goods around by fiat .
it supplied food and inputs to weavers and then took their output .
in essence , the Greek Bronze Age societies had something that looked remarkably like state capitalism .
so did the Incas as they built their huge Andean empire in the century before the Spanish arrived .
they , too , had no money ( or writing ) ; but the state conducted decennial censuses , built roughly 25,000 miles ( 40,000 kilometers ) of roads , operated a system of runners to send messages and collect information , and recorded it all using knotted strings called quipus , most of which cannot be read today .
all of this was part of their control of land and labor , based on centrally planned allocation of resources and coercion .
how is it that societies as disparate as the Greek Bronze Age cities of Knossos , Mycenae , or Pylos , the Inca Empire , Soviet Russia , South Korea , and now China all ended up with state capitalism ?
the answer lies in recognizing that state capitalism is not about efficient allocation of economic resources , but about maximizing political control over society and the economy .
if state managers can grab all productive resources and control access to them , this maximizes control - even if it sacrifices economic efficiency .
to be sure , in many parts of the world , state capitalism has helped to consolidate states and centralize authority - preconditions for the development of modern societies and economies .
but political control of the economy generally becomes problematic , because those running the state do not have social welfare or optimal resource allocation in mind .
the state capitalism of the Greek Bronze Age or the Inca Empire was not motivated by economic inefficiency ; nor did it necessarily create a more efficient economy .
what it did was help to consolidate political power .
at a deeper level , the real dichotomy is not between state capitalism and unfettered markets ; it is between extractive and inclusive economic institutions .
extractive institutions create a non @-@ level playing field , rents , and narrowly concentrated benefits for those with political power and connections .
inclusive institutions create a level playing field and give incentives and opportunities to the great mass of people .
but herein lies the problem for state capitalism : inclusive institutions require a private sector powerful enough to counterbalance and check the state .
thus , state ownership tends naturally to remove one of the key pillars of an inclusive society .
it should be no surprise that state capitalism is almost always associated with authoritarian regimes and extractive political institutions .
this is not an endorsement of unfettered markets .
the state plays a central role in modern society , and rightly so .
modern economic growth , even under inclusive institutions , often creates deep inequalities and tilted playing fields , endangering those institutions &quot; very survival .
the modern regulatory and redistributive state can , within certain bounds , help to redress these problems .
but the success of such a project crucially depends on society having control over the state - not the other way around .
to argue that state capitalism &apos;s success proves its superiority is to put the cart before the horse .
yes , South Korea grew rapidly under state capitalism , and China is doing likewise today .
but state capitalism emerged not because there was no other way to ensure economic growth in these countries , but because it enabled growth without destabilizing the existing power structure .
the genius of China &apos;s state capitalism is that it ensured the continued dominance of Communist Party elites while improving the allocation of resources , not that it alone could have provided price incentives to farmers and then managed liberalization of urban markets .
state capitalism will persist so long as existing elites are able to maintain it and benefit from it - even if economic growth ultimately stalls .
and there is a good reason why it eventually will .
sustained economic growth presupposes inclusive institutions , because innovation - and the creative destruction and instability that it wreaks - depends on them .
extractive institutions in general , and state capitalism in particular , can support economic growth for a while , but only the sort of catch @-@ up growth that South Korea experienced from the 1960 &quot; s to the 1980 &quot; s , before starting to transform its society and economy more radically .
as the low hanging fruit from catch @-@ up growth is consumed , China , too , will be forced to choose between the economic and social freedom , innovation , and instability that only inclusive institutions can underpin and continued economic , political , and social control in the service of the elites who control the state .
quitting the Quota
Hong KONG - On March 1 , China &apos;s State Council announced a new batch of restrictions aimed at reining in property prices by curbing speculative demand . the measures include tighter limits on home purchases by non @-@ locals in cities with excessive price gains , a reinforced 20 % capital @-@ gains tax , mandatory 70 % down payments , and a 30 % benchmark interest @-@ rate premium for second mortgages .
while the previous round of housing @-@ sector restrictions , implemented less than two years ago , dampened market sentiment temporarily , it failed to curb rising property prices .
likewise , although the latest measures might have some impact , cooling China &apos;s turbulent property market - which relies on cheap credit - in the long term will require addressing underlying monetary @-@ policy weaknesses .
in order to control the money supply , the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) has long used credit quotas as &quot; window guidance &quot; to banks .
the policy is rooted in central planning , which , three decades ago , led to artificially low prices and , in turn , to shortages of basic necessities and key production inputs , such as grain and steel .
as the free market developed , a dual @-@ price system emerged , in which those with access to quota @-@ allocated goods paid less .
as a result , the government was compelled to grant subsidies to the system &apos;s &quot; losers &quot; - such as urban residents and state @-@ owned enterprises ( SOEs ) - until strong supply responses to rising market prices eliminated the need for quotas on manufactured products .
a decade later , in response to the global financial crisis , China loosened credit quotas and planning controls on SOE @-@ run local @-@ government infrastructure projects .
between November 2008 and June 2009 , China &apos;s banks issued more than ¥ 8.6 trillion ( $ 1.3 trillion ) in new loans .
as a result , the rate of credit growth increased from 14 % in September 2008 to 35 % a year later , and property prices more than doubled in many cities .
excessively low interest rates have generated a mismatch between housing prices and the available supply , because they serve as hidden subsidies for those who can borrow - for example , the rich and SOEs - and thus stimulate demand for luxury property .
in order to curb this trend , policymakers have reverted to the quota as a macroeconomic tool , but this time for housing credit .
like quotas on manufactured products , these new quotas are generating a dual @-@ price allocation system , in which SOEs can borrow at significantly lower interest rates than small and medium @-@ size enterprises ( SMEs ) , which must rely on the informal market at interest rates as high as 2 % monthly .
but eliminating quotas in order to allow prices to reach market @-@ clearing levels is not an option this time , owing to the complexity and competitiveness of the real @-@ estate and bank @-@ credit markets .
three major factors are impeding policymakers from raising interest rates to market @-@ clearing levels .
first , the domestic interest groups that benefit from low borrowing costs have become a barrier to their liberalization .
there is a &quot; common @-@ sense consensus &quot; among borrowers - in China , as well as in highly indebted advanced economies - that raising interest rates would undermine GDP growth , employment , and asset prices .
second , many argue that raising interest rates would trigger a flood of speculative capital from low @-@ yielding advanced economies .
with the PBOC unable to sterilize the inflows , upward pressure on the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate would threaten competitiveness .
finally , an inadequate understanding of structural inflation ( the growth in prices for non @-@ tradable assets ) has generated the false belief that China can maintain similar levels of inflation and exchange @-@ rate stability as the OECD economies .
as a result , over the last decade , the Chinese authorities &quot; implicit target for annual inflation and currency appreciation has been only about 3 % .
but China has attained much higher GDP growth than the OECD economies , driven largely by the rapid productivity gains that characterize the initial &quot; catch up &quot; phase of emerging @-@ market development .
as China continues to implement market @-@ oriented reforms , the prices of non @-@ tradable assets - such as property , natural resources , utilities , services , and wages - will continue to rise much faster than in the OECD countries , until they eventually converge .
this process will inevitably lead to higher structural inflation and currency appreciation in China .
if nominal interest rates are lower than the real return on investment - associated with GDP growth - the result is financial repression and increased income and wealth inequality .
to avoid this outcome , as long as China &apos;s GDP growth exceeds that of OECD economies , its nominal interest rates must also be higher , its exchange rate must be more flexible , and it must tolerate higher structural inflation .
indeed , despite domestic resistance , the PBOC must raise nominal interest rates so that they are in line with structural inflation .
such a move would deter excessive investment in productive capacity , and ease the implementation of a more flexible exchange @-@ rate regime .
at the same time , one need only recall the damage that unregulated carry trades wrought on Asian economies in the 1990 &quot; s to understand why China must erect barriers to protect its domestic markets from inflows of hot money .
the alternative to this price @-@ oriented approach - continued dependence on the quota system - would incur considerable administrative expenses , efficiency losses , and social costs stemming from rent @-@ seeking and corruption .
much like the quota system of 30 years ago , the current reliance on quotas is unsustainable in the long term .
to manage exorbitant demand for financial and physical assets , China &apos;s leaders must address its root cause : the low cost of capital .
doing so will require maintaining some capital @-@ account control , while raising interest rates to market @-@ clearing levels .
this , not the unsustainable imposition of quotas , is the real monetary @-@ policy challenge facing China today .
why cutting Carbon Emissions is not Enough
twenty years ago , governments adopted the Montreal Protocol , a treaty to protect the Earth &apos;s ozone layer from emissions of destructive chemicals .
few could have foreseen how far @-@ reaching that decision would prove to be .
the Protocol explicitly aimed at phasing @-@ out substances such as chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) - found in products such as refrigerators , foams , and hairsprays - in order to repair the thin gassy @-@ shield that filters out the sun &apos;s harmful , ultra @-@ violet rays .
by 2010 , close to 100 ozone @-@ depleting substances , including CFCs , will have been phased @-@ out globally .
without the decisions taken 20 years ago , atmospheric levels of ozone @-@ depleting substances would have increased ten @-@ fold by 2050 .
this could have led to up to 20 million additional cases of skin cancer and 130 million more cases of eye cataracts , not to speak of damage to human immune systems , wildlife , and agriculture .
but this is only part of the story that we celebrate on the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer ( September 16 ) .
over the past two years , it has been established that the Montreal Protocol has also spared humanity a significant level of climate change , because the gases that it prohibits also contribute to global warming .
indeed , a study in 2007 calculated the climate mitigation benefits of the ozone treaty as totalling the equivalent of 135 billion tons of CO2 since 1990 , or a delay in global warming of 7 @-@ 12 years .
so the lessons learned from the Montreal Protocol may have wider significance .
scientists now estimate that somewhere close to 50 % of climate change is being caused by gases and pollutants other than CO2 , including nitrogen compounds , low @-@ level ozone formed by pollution , and black carbon .
of course , a degree of scientific uncertainty about some of these pollutants &quot; precise contribution to warming remains . but they certainly play a significant role .
meanwhile , many of these gases need to be curbed because of their wider environmental impact on public health , agriculture , and the planet &apos;s multi @-@ trillion dollar ecosystems , including forests .
consider black carbon , a component of the soot emissions from diesel engines and the inefficient burning of biomass cooking stoves that is linked to 1.6 million to 1.8 million premature deaths annually as a result of indoor exposure and 800,000 as a result of outdoor exposure .
black carbon , which absorbs heat from the sun , also accounts for anywhere from 10 % to more than 45 % of the contribution to global warming , and is also linked to accelerated losses of glaciers in Asia , because the soot deposits darken , ice making it more vulnerable to melting .
one study estimates that 26 % of black carbon emissions are from stoves for heating and cooking , with more than 40 % of this amount from wood burning , roughly 20 % from coal , 19 % from crop residues , and 10 % from dung .
some companies have developed stoves that use passive air flows , better insulation , and 60 % less wood to reduce black carbon emissions by around 70 % .
mass introduction of such stoves could deliver multiple green @-@ economy benefits .
while CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for centuries , other pollutants , including black carbon and ozone , remain for relatively periods - days , weeks , months , or years - so that reducing or ending emissions promises almost immediate climate benefits .
the international community &apos;s over @-@ arching concern must be to seal a serious and significant deal at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December to curtail C02 emissions and assist vulnerable countries to adapt .
if the world also is to deploy all available means to combat climate change , emissions of all substances that contribute to it must be scientifically evaluated and urgently addressed .
human Nature and the Ethical Life
new YORK - Does human nature exist ?
the answer has implications for anyone concerned about ethics .
in an era defined by amoral political leadership and eroding social values , thinking about the essence of humanity has never been more important .
the philosophical concept of &quot; human nature &quot; has a long history .
in Western culture , its study began with Socrates in the fifth century BCE , but it was Aristotle who argued that human nature was characterized by unique attributes - particularly , people &apos;s need to socialize and our ability to reason .
for the Stoics of Hellenistic Greece , human nature was what gave life meaning and contributed to their embrace of cosmopolitanism and equality .
ancient Chinese philosophers like Confucius and Mencius believed human nature was innately good , while Xunzi thought it was evil and lacked a moral compass .
in the Judeo @-@ Christian @-@ Islamic traditions , human nature is fundamentally corrupted by sin , but can be redeemed by embracing God , in whose image we have been created .
modern Western philosophers , writing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , expanded on these ideas .
the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes argued that our natural state leads to a life that is &quot; solitary , poor , nasty , brutish , and short , &quot; which is why we need a strong , centralized political authority ( the so @-@ called Leviathan ) .
by contrast , Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau believed that human nature is malleable , but that our original state was one without reason , language , or community .
he concluded that the mismatch between our early condition and modern civilization is at the root of our unhappiness , advocating a literal return to nature .
David Hume , always sensible and moderate , proposed that humans are characterized by a combination of altruism and selfishness , and that such a combination can be partially molded for the better ( or worse ) by culture .
Charles Darwin &apos;s work in the mid @-@ 1800s made many of the early &quot; essentialist &quot; views of human nature untenable .
the idea that humans had a small set of characteristics that only humans possess was at odds with the slow , gradual pace of Darwinian evolution .
while Homo sapiens evolved as a particular species of primate , there are no clean breaks between our biology and that of other species .
so the philosophical debate over human nature rages on , updated with the findings of biology .
today , some philosophers interpret Rousseau and Darwin to mean that human nature itself is nonexistent , and that while biology may constrain the body , it does not restrict our minds or our volition .
evolutionary psychologists and even some neuroscientists say that is nonsense .
the message they take from Darwin ( and partly from Rousseau ) is that we are maladaptive in a modern context - basically , Pleistocene apes who find themselves equipped with mobile phones and nuclear weapons .
as an evolutionary biologist and philosopher of science , my view is that human nature certainly exists , but that it is not based on an &quot; essence &quot; of any kind .
rather , our species , just like any other biological species , is characterized by a dynamic and evolving set of traits that are statistically typical for our lineage but neither present in every member nor absent from every other species .
why does any of this matter to someone who is not a scientist or a philosopher ?
there are at least two good reasons that I can think of . one is personal ; the other is political .
first , how we interpret human nature has broad implications for ethics , in the ancient Greco @-@ Roman sense of the study of how we should live our lives .
someone who holds a Judeo @-@ Christian @-@ Islamic view of human nature is naturally going to worship God and follow the guidance of religious Commandments .
by contrast , someone adopting an existentialist philosophy along the lines of Jean @-@ Paul Sartre or Simone de Beauvoir might believe that because &quot; existence precedes essence , &quot; we are radically free to shape our lives according to our own choices , and do not need God to help us along .
moreover , views on human nature affect views on ethics .
and today , our ethics are a mess .
one recent study in the United States called Donald Trump &apos;s presidency the &quot; most unethical &quot; in American history , while Gallup &apos;s annual survey of US attitudes toward morality suggests a steady erosion of social mores .
if we all took a moment to consider where we stood on the debate about human nature , we might gain valuable insight into our own beliefs - and by extension , the beliefs of others .
personally , I lean toward the naturalistic ethics of the Stoics , for whom human nature constrains and suggests - but does not rigidly determine - what we can and should do .
but regardless of one &apos;s religious or philosophical leanings , reflecting on who we are - biologically and otherwise - is a good way to take more ownership of our actions .
needless to say , there are many among us who could benefit from such an exercise .
the centrists Cannot Hold
Washington - In most advanced democracies , a large center @-@ right party competes with a large center @-@ left party .
of course , the extent to which an electoral system favors large parties - by having high popular @-@ vote thresholds to enter parliament , or through winner @-@ take @-@ all constituencies - affects the degree of political fragmentation .
but , by and large , the developed democracies are characterized by competition between large parties on the center left and center right .
what , then , are true centrists like Mario Monti , Italy &apos;s respected technocratic prime minister , to do ?
to be sure , regional and ethnic allegiances play a greater role in some places in Europe - for example , Scotland , Belgium , and Catalonia - but far more so in emerging countries , where political cleavages also reflect specific post @-@ colonial circumstances and often the legacy of single @-@ party rule .
nonetheless , even in &quot; emerging market &quot; democracies , such as Chile , Mexico , South Korea , and India , a left @-@ right cleavage plays an important role - while those who claim the political center generally remain weak .
the British Liberal Democrats , for example , have tried for decades to become a strong centrist third party , without success .
while the political vocabulary in the United States is different , the Democratic Party , since Franklin Roosevelt &apos;s presidency , is indeed a center @-@ left force , the Republican Party occupies the right , and no other significant party exists .
in France and Germany , there is more fragmentation .
politics is still dominated by a large center @-@ left party and a large center @-@ right party , but smaller groups - some claiming the center and others the right and left extremes - challenge them to various degrees .
in some countries , the &quot; Greens &quot; have their own identity , close to the left ; but , despite remarkable progress in Germany , they remain unable to reach the electoral size of the large center @-@ right and center @-@ left parties .
variations of this basic structure exist in Spain , Portugal , Greece , Turkey , and the Nordic countries .
the situation is particularly interesting in Italy , where Monti , having decided to contest the upcoming general election , has had to position himself on the right ( which he signaled by attending a gathering of the leaders of Europe &apos;s center @-@ right parties ) .
he and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi are now fighting for space on the right , with the center @-@ left Democrats leading in the polls .
there are at least four differences between center @-@ right and center @-@ left approaches to social and economic challenges .
the right has greater confidence in markets to allocate resources and provide appropriate incentives ; favors private consumption over public goods ; is minimally concerned with economic inequality ; and tends to be more nationalistic and less optimistic about international cooperation .
the left , by contrast , believes that markets , particularly financial markets , need considerable government regulation and supervision to function well ; gives greater weight to public goods ( for example , parks , a clean environment , and mass @-@ transit systems ) ; seeks to reduce economic inequality , believing that it undermines democracy and the sense of fairness that is important to well @-@ being ; and is more willing to pursue international cooperation as a means to secure peace and provide global public goods , such as climate protection .
when looking at actual economic policies as they have evolved over decades , we see that they always combine center @-@ right and center @-@ left elements .
repeated financial crises have tempered even the right &apos;s faith in unregulated markets , while the left has become more realistic and cautious about state planning and bureaucratic processes .
likewise , the choice between privately consumed and publicly consumed &quot; goods &quot; is often blurred , as politicians tend to reinforce citizens &quot; understandable tendency to demand public goods while rejecting the taxes needed to pay for them .
as income inequality has increased - dramatically in some countries , such as the US - it is moving to the forefront of the debate , reinforcing the traditional political divide .
nonetheless , the center right and the center left are arguing about the degree of redistribution , not about the need for some progressivity in taxes and transfers .
both also agree on the need for international cooperation in an increasingly interdependent world , with differences mainly concerning how much effort to spend on it .
so , given that differences in policies as they are implemented have become largely a matter of degree , why do centrist parties remain weak ?
why have they failed to unite moderates on both sides of the ideological divide ?
one reason is that only a minority of any population is active politically .
active party members hold more ideologically consistent views - and hold them more strongly - than most of those who are politically less engaged , giving activists disproportionate influence in the political process .
after all , more nuanced ideas and policy proposals are relatively difficult to propagate effectively enough to generate broad and enthusiastic popular support .
but there also really are fundamental differences in values and economic philosophies , as well as in economic interests , leading to a fairly consistent positioning of voters on the right or left .
disagreement may lead to compromises , but that does not change the underlying differences in starting positions .
it is probably a good thing that structured competition between large center @-@ right and center @-@ left parties persists .
such parties can help to integrate the extremes into the political mainstream , while facilitating alternation in power , which is essential to any democracy &apos;s dynamism ; a system in which a large centrist party remained permanently in power would be far less desirable .
those , like Monti , who want to mount a challenge from the center , however personally impressive they may be , have steep obstacles to overcome , and for good reasons .
why Democracy Requires trusted Experts
Paris - Last month , I wrote a commentary asking why voters in the United Kingdom supported leaving the European Union , defying the overwhelming weight of expert opinion warning of the major economic costs of Brexit .
I observed that many voters in the UK and elsewhere are angry at economic experts .
they say that the experts failed to foresee the financial crisis of 2008 , put efficiency first in their policy advice , and blindly assumed that the losers from their policy prescriptions could be compensated in some unspecified way .
I argued that experts should be humbler and more attentive to distributional issues .
the piece elicited far more comments from readers than any of my others .
their reactions mostly confirm the anger I had noted .
they regard economists and other experts as isolated from and indifferent to the concerns of ordinary people ; driven by an agenda that does not coincide with that of citizens ; often blatantly wrong , and therefore incompetent ; biased in favor of , or simply captured by , big business and the financial industry ; and naive - failing to see that politicians select analyses that suit their ends and disregard the rest .
experts , said some , are also guilty of fracturing society by segmenting the debate into myriad narrow , specialized discussions .
remarkably , I also received comments from professionals in the natural sciences who said that citizens &quot; growing distrust of experts was pervasive in their disciplines , too .
scientific views in fields like energy , climate , genetics , and medicine face widespread popular rejection .
in the United States , for example , a Pew Research survey found that 67 % of adults think that scientists lack a clear understanding about the health effects of genetically modified organisms .
mistrust of GMOs is even higher in Europe .
whereas overall support for science remains strong , many citizens believe that it is manipulated by special interests , and on some issues , the common view departs from the established evidence .
this divide between experts and citizens is a cause for deep concern .
representative democracy is based not only on universal suffrage , but also on reason .
ideally , deliberations and votes result in rational decisions that use the current state of knowledge to deliver policies that advance citizens &quot; wellbeing .
this requires a process in which experts - whose competence and honesty are trusted - inform decision @-@ makers of the available options for meeting voters &quot; stated preferences .
citizens are unlikely to be satisfied if they believe that experts are imposing their own agenda , or are captured by special interests .
distrust of experts fuels distrust of democratically elected governments , if not of democracy itself .
why is there such a divide between experts and society ?
every country has had its own series of high @-@ profile public health or safety scandals .
experts have been guilty of sloppiness and conflicts of interest .
hard @-@ won reputations have been quickly lost .
but critics often fail to recognize that science involves more - and more stringent - scrutiny than , say , business or government .
it is actually the standard @-@ bearer of good practices concerning the validation of analyses and the discussion of policy proposals .
errors regularly occur in academia , but they are more swiftly and systematically corrected than in other fields .
the collective nature of scientific validation also provides guarantees against capture by special interests .
the problem may , in fact , be deeper than the common grievances against experts suggest .
a few decades ago , it was widely assumed that progress in mass education would gradually bridge the gap between scientific knowledge and popular belief , thereby contributing to a more serene and more rational democracy .
the evidence is that it has not .
as Gerald Bronner , a French sociologist , has convincingly shown , education neither increases trust in science nor diminishes the attraction of beliefs or theories that scientists regard as utter nonsense .
on the contrary , more educated citizens often resent being told by experts what science regards as truth .
having had access to knowledge , they feel empowered enough to criticize the cognoscenti and develop views of their own .
climate change - which the scientific community overwhelmingly regards it as a major threat - is a case in point .
according to a 2015 Pew Research survey , the three countries where concern is the weakest are the US , Australia , and Canada , whereas the three in which it is the strongest are Brazil , Peru , and Burkina Faso .
yet average years of schooling are 12.5 for the first group and six for the second .
evidently , education alone is not the reason for this difference in perception .
if the problem is here to stay , we had better do more to address it .
first , we need more discipline on the part of the community of experts .
the intellectual discipline that characterizes research is often lacking in policy discussions .
humility , rigorous procedures , the prevention of conflicts of interest , an ability to acknowledge mistakes and , yes , punishment of fraudulent behavior are needed to regain citizens &quot; trust .
second , there is a case for revising curricula to equip future citizens with the intellectual tools they will need to distinguish between fact and fiction .
society has everything to gain from citizens whose minds are both less suspicious and more critical .
finally , we need better venues for dialogue and informed debate .
serious magazines , general @-@ interest journals , and newspapers traditionally filled the space between the Ether of peer @-@ reviewed journals and the deep sea of hoaxes ; yet they all struggle to survive the digital revolution .
other venues , perhaps new institutions , are needed to fill that space .
what is clear is that democracy cannot thrive if it is left empty .
emerging @-@ Market Resilience
new YORK - With most of the world focused on economic instability and anemic growth in the advanced countries , developing countries , with the possible exception of China , have received relatively little attention .
but , as a group , emerging @-@ market economies have been negatively affected by the recent downturn in developed countries .
can they rebound on their own ?
the major emerging economies were the world &apos;s main growth engines following the eruption of the financial crisis in 2008 , and , to some extent , they still are .
but their resilience has always been a function of their ability to generate enough incremental aggregate demand to support their growth , without having to make up for a large loss of demand in developed countries .
a combination of negligible ( or even negative ) growth in Europe and a significant growth slowdown in the United States has now created that loss , undermining emerging economies &quot; exports .
Europe is a major export destination for many developing countries , and is China &apos;s largest foreign market .
China , in turn , is a major market for final products , intermediate goods ( including those used to produce finished exports ) , and commodities .
the ripple effect from Europe &apos;s stalling economy has thus spread rapidly to the rest of Asia and beyond .
moreover , not only is the tradable sector of Japan &apos;s economy highly vulnerable to a slowdown in China , but the recent conflict over the Senkaku / Diaoyu Islands raises the prospect of economic decoupling .
apart from that , Japanese economic performance is set to remain weak , because the non @-@ tradable side is not a strong growth engine .
the key questions for the world economy today , then , are how significant the growth slowdown will be , and how long it will last .
with wise policy responses , the impact is likely to be relatively mild and short @-@ lived .
one key issue clouding the future is trade finance .
European banks , traditionally a major source of trade finance , have pulled back dramatically , owing to capital @-@ adequacy problems caused by sovereign @-@ debt capital losses and , in some cases , losses from real @-@ estate lending .
this vacuum could reduce trade flows even if demand were present .
in Asia , especially , filling the vacuum with alternative financing mechanisms has become a high priority .
in particular , although China &apos;s tradable sector is highly exposed to developed economies , the government is likely to accept some short @-@ run slowdown , rather than adopting potentially distorting stimulus measures .
given the risk of re @-@ inflating asset bubbles , no one should expect a dramatic easing of credit of the type that followed the 2008 meltdown .
an accelerated public @-@ investment program that avoids low @-@ return projects is not out of the question .
but the best and most likely responses are those that accelerate domestic consumption growth by increasing household income , effectively deploy income from state @-@ owned assets , and strengthen China &apos;s social @-@ security systems in order to reduce precautionary saving .
indeed , these are all key components of China &apos;s recently adopted 12th Five @-@ Year Plan .
admittedly , China &apos;s major systemic reforms await the country &apos;s leadership transition , now expected in November .
by most accounts , the pace of reform directed at expanding the market side of the economy needs to pick up quickly to achieve the ambitious economic and social goals of the next five years .
some countries have bucked the global trend .
Indonesia , for example , has experienced accelerating growth , with rising business and consumer confidence boosting investment to almost 33 % of GDP .
likewise , Brazil &apos;s growth has been dented , but now looks set to recover .
moreover , overall economic performance in Brazil masks an important fact : growth rates have been substantially higher among the country &apos;s poorer citizens , and unemployment is declining .
the aggregate growth rate does not capture this inclusiveness , and thus understates the pace of economic and social progress .
the main challenge for Brazil is to increase its investment rate from 18 % of GDP currently to closer to 25 % , thereby sustaining rapid growth and economic diversification .
commodity dependence , even with the creation of considerable domestic value added , remains high .
economic @-@ growth rates in other systemically large countries , including Turkey and Mexico , have risen as well , despite European and US headwinds .
many African countries , too , are showing a broad pattern of sound macroeconomic fundamentals , durable growth acceleration , economic diversification , and investor confidence .
the outlook for India &apos;s economy remains more uncertain .
while growth slowed recently from very high rates - owing to a combination of exposure to developed @-@ country weakness , internal loss of reform momentum , and declining investor confidence - that trend appears to be reversing after recent decisive corrective moves by the government .
the main question is whether India &apos;s parliament will pass crucial legislation or remain paralyzed by hyper @-@ partisan , scandal @-@ fueled infighting .
combining this general picture with more general developing @-@ country trends - rising incomes , rapid growth in middle classes , expanding trade and investment flows , bilateral and regional free @-@ trade agreements , and a growing share of global GDP ( roughly 50 % ) - these economies &quot; growth momentum should return relatively rapidly , over the next 1 @-@ 2 years .
most of the downside risk to this scenario lies in the systemically important economies of Europe , the US , and China .
to derail emerging economies &quot; growth momentum at this stage probably would require either an additional major demand shock from the advanced economies , or some kind of failure in China &apos;s leadership transition that impedes systemic reform and affects the country &apos;s growth .
notwithstanding low growth forecasts for the entire developed world , these systemic risks , taken individually and in combination , appear to be declining ( though certainly not to the point that they can be dismissed ) .
on balance , then , the multispeed growth patterns of the past decade are likely to continue .
even as the developed economies experience an extended period of below @-@ trend growth , the emerging economies will remain an important growth engine .
why Did Economists Not foresee the Crisis ?
Chicago - At the height of the financial crisis , the Queen of England asked my friends at the London School of Economics a simple question , but one for which there is no easy answer : why did academic economists fail to foresee the crisis ?
several responses to that query exist .
one is that economists lacked models that could account for the behavior that led to the crisis .
another is that economists were blinkered by an ideology according to which a free and unfettered market could do no wrong .
finally , an answer that is gaining ground is that the system bribed economists to stay silent .
in my view , the truth lies elsewhere .
it is not true that we academics did not have useful models to explain what happened .
if you believe that the crisis was caused by a shortage of liquidity , we had plenty of models analyzing liquidity shortages and their effects on financial institutions .
if you believe that the blame lies with greedy bankers and unthinking investors , lulled by the promise of a government bailout , or with a market driven crazy by irrational exuberance , we had studied all this too , in great detail .
economists even analyzed the political economy of regulation and deregulation , so we could have understood why some US politicians pushed the private sector into financing affordable housing , while others deregulated private finance .
yet , somehow , we did not bring all this understanding to bear and collectively shout our warnings .
perhaps the reason was ideology : we were too wedded to the idea that markets are efficient , market participants are rational , and high prices are justified by economic fundamentals .
but some of this criticism of &quot; market fundamentalism &quot; reflects a misunderstanding .
the dominant &quot; efficient markets theory &quot; says only that markets reflect what is publicly known , and that it is hard to make money off markets consistently - something verified by the hit that most investor portfolios took in the crisis .
the theory does not say that markets cannot plummet if the news is bad , or if investors become risk @-@ averse .
critics argue that the fundamentals were deteriorating in plain sight , and that the market ( and economists ) ignored it .
but hindsight distorts analysis .
we cannot point to a lonely Cassandra like Robert Shiller of Yale University , who regularly argued that house prices were unsustainable , as proof that the truth was ignored .
there are always naysayers , and they are often wrong .
there were many more economists who believed that house prices , though high , were unlikely to fall across the board .
of course , these expectations could have been distorted by ideology - it is hard to get into the past minds of economists .
but there is a better reason to be skeptical of explanations relying on ideology . as a group , neither behavioral economists , who think that market efficiency is a joke , nor progressive economists , who distrust free markets , predicted the crisis .
could it be corruption ?
some academic economists consult for banks or rating agencies , give speeches to investor conferences , serve as expert witnesses , and carry out sponsored research .
it would be natural to suspect us of bias .
the bias could be implicit : our worldview is shaped by what our friends in industry believe . or it may be an explicit bias : an economist might write a report that is influenced by what a sponsor wants to hear , or give testimony that is purely mercenary .
there are enough instances of possible bias that the issue cannot be ignored .
one remedy would be to ban all interaction between economists and the corporate world .
but if economists were confined to the ivory tower , we might be unbiased , but we would also be ignorant of practicalities - and thus even less capable of predicting problems . one way to restore trust may be disclosure - for economists to declare a monetary interest in a particular analysis and , more generally , to explain who pays us .
a number of universities are moving in this direction .
but I believe that corruption is not the main reason that the profession missed the crisis .
most economists have very little interaction with the corporate world , and these &quot; unbiased &quot; economists were no better at forecasting the crisis .
I would argue that three factors largely explain our collective failure : specialization , the difficulty of forecasting , and the disengagement of much of the profession from the real world .
like medicine , economics has become highly compartmentalized - macroeconomists typically do not pay attention to what financial economists or real @-@ estate economists study , and vice versa .
yet , to see the crisis coming would have required someone who knew about each of these areas - just as it takes a good general practitioner to recognize an exotic disease .
because the profession rewards only careful , well @-@ supported , but necessarily narrow analysis , few economists try to span sub @-@ fields .
even if they did , they would shy away from forecasting .
the main advantage that academic economists have over professional forecasters may be their greater awareness of established relationships between factors .
what is hardest to forecast , though , are turning points - when the old relationships break down .
while there may be some factors that signal turning points - a run @-@ up in short @-@ term leverage and asset prices , for example , often presages a bust - they are not infallible predictors of trouble to come .
the meager professional rewards for breadth , coupled with the inaccuracy and reputational risk associated with forecasting , leads to disengagement for most academics . and it may well be that academic economists have little to say about short @-@ term economic movements , so that forecasting , with all its errors , is best left to professional forecasters .
the danger is that disengagement from short @-@ term developments leads academic economists to ignore medium @-@ term trends that they can address .
if so , the true reason why academics missed the crisis could be far more mundane than inadequate models , ideological blindness , or corruption , and thus far more worrisome ; many simply were not paying attention !
Malala &apos;s Revolution
Islamabad - The men who attempted to kill 14 @-@ year @-@ old Malala Yousafzai on October 9 knew what she represented .
her active involvement since the age of eleven in campaigning for the rights of girls in her region to be educated was well known .
Malala &apos;s efforts , while applauded by the West and some segments of Pakistani society , were deeply resented by the obscurantist forces that go by the name of the Taliban , which in Pakistan calls itself Tehrik @-@ e @-@ Taliban Pakistan .
their choice of name is an ironic one , for Taliban , an Arabic word , means those seeking to be educated , whereas the Taliban &apos;s principal aim is to keep Muslim societies backward so that they can be persuaded to adopt a seventh @-@ century version of Islam .
education , particularly of women , stands in the way of achieving this goal .
but the attack on Malala will , most likely , have an effect that is opposite to that intended by those who carried it out .
several religious leaders joined the chorus of condemnation that followed the attack on Malala .
in a sign of unity , a council of Sunni Muslim scholars in the eastern city of Lahore issued a fatwa , signed by 50 clerics , saying that the justifications cited by the girl &apos;s attackers were &quot; deviant &quot; and had no basis in Islamic law .
the Taliban seem to have been taken aback by the public and media reaction to the attack .
dawn , Pakistan &apos;s largest @-@ circulation English @-@ language newspaper , reported that Hakimullah Mehsud , the Pakistani Taliban &apos;s leader , had ordered his foot soldiers to target media organizations in Karachi , Lahore , Rawalpindi , and Islamabad in response .
several TV channels had been extremely critical of the Taliban &apos;s assaults on Pakistani society .
the extremists wanted to silence the majority that was waking up to the existential threat that radical Islam poses to their country .
there is a widespread belief that Pakistani women are doing poorly when it comes to obtaining education .
that impression is correct to some extent .
the overall literacy rate for women is undoubtedly low - much lower than that for men .
but male education and literacy in Pakistan is not very high , either .
although Pakistan is a signatory to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals , which include attainment of universal literacy for both boys and girls by 2015 , the country is far from achieving the target , with literacy rates of 70 % for boys and only 45 % for girls in 2010 .
that said , over the 17 @-@ year period from 1993 to 2010 , the number of girls enrolled in primary education increased from 3.7 million to 8.3 million .
this implies a rate of growth of 6.7 % a year , about 2.5 times the rate of increase in the number of girls entering the primary @-@ school age cohort .
but , even with this growth rate , girls still accounted for just 44.3 % of the total number of enrolled students in 2010 .
it is in higher education that Pakistani women have made extraordinary progress in recent years .
their share of total college enrollment has increased from 36 % to 57 % over the last couple of decades , rising from less than 15,000 in 1993 to 436,000 in 2010 .
the proportion of women receiving higher education is approaching the 60 % mark , owing to an impressive 28 % annual rate of growth in their enrollment numbers in 2010 , up from a 20 % increase in 1993 .
although a very large number of girls drop out after primary school , the number completing higher education is now large .
this year , roughly 750,000 women will graduate from Pakistan &apos;s institutions of higher learning .
if the current rate of growth is maintained , by 2015 the number of women completing higher education could exceed 1.5 million a year .
had Malala died , she eventually would have been forgotten - another victim of the war that the extremists are waging in Pakistan . her death would have added just one more individual to the tens of thousands who have already been killed in terrorist attacks across the country .
Malala &apos;s survival - and possibly even full recovery - provides a vibrant symbol for a troubled country .
she will begin to be identified with the change that is already underway .
it is not often recognized that women in Pakistan - at least those of a certain class - are receiving the kind of education that enables them to enter the modern sectors of the economy or to become entrepreneurs .
in education , numbers make a revolution .
the extremists understand that all too well .
a talking Cure for Syria
London - The proposal by the United States and Russia to hold a diplomatic conference to end the carnage in Syria deserves a less skeptical reaction than it has received .
while it will be difficult to get all of the relevant parties to the table in Geneva any time soon , much less to ensure an outcome that will stick , diplomacy is the only game left .
as much as one might wish otherwise , every other policy option canvassed so far is wrong in principle , nonviable in practice , unlikely to be effective , or bound to increase rather than diminish suffering .
after two years of civil war , with no decisive military victory by either side in sight , the situation could not be more desperate .
according to current United Nations estimates , more than 80,000 Syrians are dead , and 6.8 million - one @-@ third of the country &apos;s population - need urgent humanitarian assistance .
some 4.25 million are displaced internally , and more than 1.5 million have fled the country , sheltering as refugees mainly in Lebanon , Jordan , and Turkey .
the strain on Syria &apos;s neighbors is immense , and the conflict is inexorably seeping into the wider region .
both government and rebel forces have committed atrocity crimes .
many more are feared as violence among the main sectarian groups escalates .
continued international paralysis is indefensible .
inaction would ignite fires throughout the Middle East , and would violate the international community &apos;s now @-@ accepted responsibility to protect , through timely and decisive collective action , populations at risk of genocide , ethnic cleansing , and other major crimes against humanity and war crimes .
that principle , unanimously agreed by the UN General Assembly in 2005 , has been successfully invoked elsewhere , including in support of diplomatic intervention in Kenya in 2008 .
it also underpinned Security Council @-@ mandated military interventions in Libya and Cote d &apos;Ivoire in 2011 and , more recently , in Mali .
but how can it be applied to the mess now in Syria ?
the most immediate need , about which there should be little controversy , is massive humanitarian assistance .
delivery problems abound in the war zones , but not everywhere .
yet international donors are dragging their feet both in meeting existing commitments and in making new ones .
and all the aid in the world won &apos;t stop the killing .
it is too late now for non @-@ military tools of coercion to have much effect , although Security Council threats of International Criminal Court prosecution for atrocity crimes - including any use of chemical weapons - must remain on the table .
but what of the military @-@ response options still strongly favored by many policymakers and pundits ?
the trouble is that every tray in this toolkit , too , is empty .
direct military intervention to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime would never win Security Council approval , and has no volunteers anyway among capable military powers - albeit in most cases because of the political and military risks involved , rather than the legal indefensibility of acting outside the UN Charter .
a less partisan intervention - pouring in troops and airpower to separate the warring parties forcibly - also has no takers , no likely UN authority , and only marginal hope of causing less harm than it would be intended to avoid .
there are many more enthusiasts for a more calibrated military intervention , designed to establish one or more no @-@ fly zones , and maybe safe havens and humanitarian corridors on the ground .
in the early days of the crisis , it was argued that , given the strength of the regime &apos;s air defenses and ground forces , even these limited objectives could not be achieved without fighting an all @-@ out war - and thus causing a net increase in human suffering .
with most of the country now ablaze , this argument is less convincing .
but it remains the case that there are no obvious takers for a military role , partly because of the scale , difficulty , and risk of the commitment required , and partly because of the likely political and legal costs , given the minimal prospect of Security Council endorsement .
the United Kingdom and France are pressing hard for indirect military intervention : supplying arms to the rebel side , in their view , would be a low @-@ cost , low @-@ risk , potentially high @-@ return option .
and the European Union has now lifted its ban .
but the US is rightly cautious .
a troubling proportion of the opposition forces are Islamic extremists , and there is no guarantee that weapons deliveries will stay out of their hands .
more broadly , increases in the supply of weapons funneled to rebel forces by Qatar , Saudi Arabia , and others have correlated with surges in the civilian death toll , suggesting that they cost more lives than they save - and with no evident strategic gains .
the Assad regime , with its own external supporters , seems likely to have no difficulty matching any new hardware thrown at it .
if the rationale for arming the opposition is not so much to win the war as to weaken the government &apos;s resistance to negotiation , it is arguable that the elements of a &quot; hurting stalemate &quot; are already in place , with more weapons likely to produce nothing but more fighting and more casualties .
the pressure that has always mattered most for the Assad regime is that capable of being applied by Russia .
what is new , and encouraging , about the events of the last month is that Russia has found enough common ground with the US - in their mutual anxiety about the rising influence of radical Islam in an increasingly fragmented and volatile region - to be prepared at last to do some squeezing .
painful concessions will be required from both sides if the Geneva conference is even to convene , let alone reach agreement on a cease @-@ fire and transitional administration .
it is encouraging that the US , following talks between Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , seems prepared to accept a role for senior Assad regime members in any settlement , and that constructive proposals are starting to emerge from at least some opposition quarters .
compromise can be anathema for purists , but it has always been the stuff of which peace is made .
it has never been more necessary than it is now in Syria .
the Limits of Twitter Diplomacy
Denver - Twentieth @-@ century American statecraft produced Dean Acheson , Henry Kissinger , Richard Holbrooke , and many others who balanced the power of the United States with its responsibilities to develop key relationships , solve problems , and build international structures .
&quot; twenty @-@ first @-@ century statecraft , &quot; we have been told repeatedly , promises to go further and deliver more , for now US diplomats - and those of other countries - can use Twitter , Facebook , and other social media .
with so many international problems today , diplomacy does need to combine the old @-@ fashioned statecraft of the twentieth century with the new tools that budding technologies have provided .
but tools alone cannot solve or build anything .
and yet the new tools are everywhere .
it is hard to find a US ambassador in any part of the world who has not embraced the challenge of mastering these communication technologies .
most have a Twitter or Facebook account , or post frequently on YouTube , in order to keep the public in the countries where they serve ( and at home ) informed of their daily activities , or occasionally their thinking about an issue or even their mood .
the State Department estimates that its employees are in direct communication with more than 15 million people worldwide .
incredibly enough , more than 330,000 people &quot; like &quot; the personality @-@ challenged department &apos;s Facebook page .
this generation of American diplomats is fast overcoming a reputation for being remote , emotionally distant figures .
to be fair , in the past , an ambassador had few opportunities to connect with the host country &apos;s population , apart from the occasional newspaper or television interview , or a photo of a meeting with a host country official or waiting on an airport &apos;s tarmac for a visitor from Washington , DC .
now , as America &apos;s tweeting diplomats have shown , there is no shortage of such opportunities .
time constraints are not an issue .
most US embassies ensure a constant stream of tweets by relying on public @-@ diplomacy officers to get the word out about what the ambassador is doing day by day , even hour by hour .
many ambassadors have built mass followings in electronic terms , and generate numerous &quot; likes &quot; as they go about their daily routines of meetings and ribbon cuttings .
all fun stuff .
but have social media really made for better diplomats or helped solve difficult problems ?
if so , why are there so many unmitigated and unmediated crises around the world - Syria &apos;s civil war , the carnage in Egypt , and deteriorating US @-@ Russian relations , to name just a few .
the much @-@ ballyhooed twenty @-@ first @-@ century statecraft , it seems , is really not up to the job .
advocates accurately point out that social media are a tool that is ignored at one &apos;s peril .
but what is urgently needed today is an understanding that diplomacy is not only about shouting from the rooftops and communicating with the general public .
it is about working on relationships one at a time .
above all , it is about keeping the door open to deal with unsavory governments .
governments , even terrible ones , comprise the people who lead a country .
maybe they shouldn &apos;t be in power ; maybe the people demonstrating in the streets should be .
but , in the here and now , these relationships need to be maintained in order to help polarized societies make progress toward overcoming their divisions .
the US ambassador to Egypt , Anne W. Patterson , was excoriated in the media - especially in social media , which have no international boundaries ( and often no manners ) - for her courageous efforts to keep the door open for dialogue with the Muslim Brotherhood government .
she did what any good - and , in her case , superb - diplomat should do : maintain relations with both sides and try to find a way forward .
indeed , the Muslim Brotherhood government and the secular opposition both complained about America &apos;s relationship with the other .
that is the hot seat where American diplomacy belongs .
with all due respect to &quot; eDiplomacy , &quot; this type of private , traditional communication remains the heart and soul of the business .
similarly , Secretary of State John Kerry has launched a courageous effort to revive the Israel @-@ Palestine peace process .
given the dearth of public information about his strategy , it is clear that he is not an avid practitioner of twenty @-@ first @-@ century statecraft - that is , he does not think out loud .
and yet he got the parties together by developing trust , which is the coin of the realm for an effective diplomat .
it is perhaps a little unfair to contrast these efforts to what the US did in Syria .
in an effort to stay ahead of intense media expectations ( and reflecting a misunderstanding according to which Syria would be just another Tunisia ) , President Barack Obama &apos;s administration essentially severed America &apos;s relationship with Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime by publicly embracing the disparate opposition and calling for Assad &apos;s immediate removal .
the US did not offer any clear indication of what it thought should follow such an outcome , apart from some kind of election process , which in a largely sectarian conflict like Syria &apos;s would amount to nothing more than an elaborate census .
lo and behold , political leaders , especially tough and terrible ones like Assad , tend not to embrace a process whose stated purpose is to eliminate them .
US diplomats - indeed , all countries &quot; diplomats - might want to consider that , rather than chasing record numbers of social media &quot; followers , &quot; they should be building trust on all sides in conflict @-@ prone societies and looking for more leaders willing to take chances for peace .
when the shooting has stopped and the sides are talking , diplomats can tweet to their hearts &quot; content .
why Do Economies Stop Growing ?
Milan - Over the years , advanced and developing countries have experimented , sometimes deliberately and frequently inadvertently , with a variety of approaches to growth .
unfortunately , many of these strategies have turned out to have built @-@ in limitations or decelerators - what one might call elements of unsustainability .
and avoiding serious damage and difficult recoveries requires us to get a lot better at recognizing these self @-@ limiting growth patterns early on .
here are some of the items in a growing library of decelerating growth models .
in developing countries , import substitution as a way to jump @-@ start economic diversification can work for a while ; but , over time , as productivity growth lags and comparative advantage is over @-@ ridden , growth grinds to a halt .
small , open economies are naturally somewhat specialized , which leaves them vulnerable to shocks and volatility .
but , in terms of growth and living standards , the cost of economic diversification , when implemented by protecting domestic industries from foreign competition , eventually outweighs the benefits .
it is better to allow specialization , and build effective social safety nets and support systems to protect people and families during economic transitions .
such &quot; structural flexibility &quot; is better adapted to enabling the broad changes that rapidly evolving technological and global economic forces require .
mismanagement of natural @-@ resource wealth underpins an especially potent self @-@ limiting pattern of growth and development .
if invested in infrastructure , education , and external financial assets , natural @-@ resource revenues can accelerate growth . but , too often , such revenues distort economic incentives , which come to favor rent @-@ seeking and interfere with the diversification that is essential for growth .
more recently , many advanced countries have discovered a &quot; new &quot; set of growth models with built @-@ in structural limitations : excessive private or public consumption , or both , usually accompanied and enabled by rising debt and inflated asset prices , and a corresponding decline in investment .
this approach appears to work until domestic aggregate demand can no longer sustain growth and employment , at which point it ends in either gradual stagnation or a violent financial and economic crisis .
( in fact , many developing countries have learned this the hard way , but the lessons seem not to have crossed over to advanced countries . )
but the opposite of the excessive @-@ consumption model - excessive reliance on investment to generate aggregate demand - is also a self @-@ limiting growth pattern .
when the private and social returns of investment diminish too much , growth cannot be sustained indefinitely , even though rising investment rates can sustain aggregate demand for a while .
altering this growth pattern is a significant part of the challenge that China now faces .
rising inequality in either opportunity or outcomes ( and often both ) also poses threats to the sustainability of growth patterns .
while people in a wide range of countries accept some degree of market @-@ determined income variation , based on differential talents and personal preferences , there are limits .
when they are breached , the typical result is a sense of unfairness , followed by resistance and , ultimately , political choices that address the inequality , though sometimes in counter @-@ productive , growth @-@ impeding ways .
perhaps the largest long @-@ run sustainability issue concerns the adequacy of the global economy &apos;s natural @-@ resource base : output will more than triple over the coming two or three decades , as high @-@ growth developing economies &quot; four billion people converge toward advanced @-@ country income levels and consumption patterns .
existing economic @-@ development strategies will require significant adaption to accommodate this kind of growth .
some adaptation will occur naturally , as rising energy and other commodity prices generate incentives to economize or seek alternatives .
but the un @-@ priced environmental externalities - global warming and water depletion , for example - will require serious attention , not myopic , reactive mindsets and approaches .
all of these self @-@ limiting growth patterns tend to have three things in common .
first , in one or several dimensions , some part of the economy &apos;s base of tangible , intangible , and natural @-@ resource assets is being run down .
I would include social cohesion as part of the asset base : it is the one that is depreciated by excessive inequality .
measurement issues play an important role here .
it is easier to run down something that is partly invisible because it is not regularly or effectively measured .
expanded measurement of the dimensions of economic , social , and environmental performance is necessary to broaden awareness of sustainability issues .
second , unidentified self @-@ limiting growth patterns produce very bad results .
expectations come to exceed reality , and resetting the system to a sustainable growth pattern is difficult .
after all , past investment shortfalls have to be made up and future @-@ oriented investments undertaken simultaneously - a double burden that must be borne by the current generation .
an inability to resolve the distributional and fairness problem can produce gridlock , paralysis , and prolonged stagnation .
finally , many of these flawed growth patterns involve fiscal distress .
contrary to the prevailing wisdom nowadays , some degree of Keynesian demand management in the transition to a more sustainable growth pattern is not in conflict with restoring fiscal balance over a sensible time period .
on the contrary , applied both individually and together , fiscal stimulus and consolidation are necessary parts of the adjustment process .
but they are not sufficient .
the crucial missing pieces are a shift in the structure of accessible aggregate demand and restoration of those parts of the economy &apos;s asset base that have been run down , implying the need for structural change and investment .
why Does Angela Merkel hesitate ?
Munich - &quot; Where is Angela ? &quot; is the question The Economist asked when Nicolas Sarkozy , Gordon Brown , and José Manuel Barroso met to prepare a European economic stimulus plan without Chancellor Merkel being present .
indeed , Germany is currently the spoiler in the competition to provide billions to prevent a breakdown of the world economy .
why is Germany so hesitant when it comes to economic stimulus programs ?
one popular theory is that , given the supply @-@ side orientation of German economists , there is little sympathy for Keynesian , demand @-@ oriented prescriptions .
but no German economist has come out against an economic stimulus program , and many favor one .
whereas Keynesian theory has largely disappeared from economic textbooks in the United States , it continues to be taught everywhere in Germany .
German economists , in contrast to their American colleagues , never abandoned Keynesian policies as a means to combat demand deficits .
moreover , German politicians rarely heed the advice of German economists .
a second hypothesis is closer to the truth : the decline of economic activity in Germany thus far has not been as strong as in other countries .
Germany did not have a real @-@ estate bubble that threatened to burst , as did Great Britain , Ireland , Spain , and France .
Germany has only been indirectly affected - by the decline in worldwide demand for German products - which explains an important timing difference in the business cycle .
whereas unemployment in the US has been rising for one and a half years , Germany currently is enjoying its lowest unemployment rate in 16 years .
the German construction industry and retailing are still stable , as the latest survey of the Ifo Institute shows , and the whole world is profiting from this stability , as Germany is the second largest importer of goods and services after the US .
while US imports are declining sharply , German imports are holding up -without any economic stimulus plan .
this is why many Germans wonder whether the foreign criticism is fair .
to be sure , the world recession will hit Germany with full force .
the Ifo Institute has forecast that GDP will contract by 2.2 % in 2009 .
but the contraction will be primarily because of declining exports , a large portion of which consists of investment goods , as well as the drop in domestic equipment investment .
these are areas where there is not much that the state can do to help .
it can cut taxes to stimulate consumption and it can invest in construction , but these sectors currently need little help , except perhaps for the automobile industry .
this could , of course , quickly change .
when the second @-@ round effects hit the domestic sector in the course of 2009 , a stimulus program will be needed .
from the German perspective , the best timing for such a program would be the autumn of next year .
if the money is spent now , the economy in some sectors could overheat , helping no one .
Paul Krugman , who has aimed massive criticism at Germany &apos;s government , should keep this in mind .
Krugman is an excellent economist .
he is right in principle in demanding a major economic stimulus package from the German government that goes beyond the € 35 billion already planned .
but he should not ignore the time lags between the American and the German economic cycles .
Germany should prepare its economic stimulus program now and implement it when the time comes .
a third hypothesis to explain Germany &apos;s hesitancy is suspicion of the European Union &apos;s redistribution machinery .
when Sarkozy and other EU leaders demand Germany &apos;s participation in an economic stimulus and rescue package , one reason is that they expect Germany to again bear the lion &apos;s share of the costs .
for example , of the € 5 billion extension of the Cohesion Funds approved by the European Parliament in December 2007 , Germany received nothing , but it bears 20 % of the costs .
Germans have always been enthusiastic proponents of the EU , not least because they hoped that a European identity would help compensate for their damaged national identity .
so , whenever it came to restructuring the EU , they always accepted a level of influence that was small relative to their country &apos;s size .
although Germany &apos;s share of the EU population is 17 % , it receives 13 % of the voting rights in the EU Parliament .
its share in the more important Council of Ministers is only 8 % , the same as that of the French , whose population share is 13 % .
former French President Jacques Chirac did not hesitate to justify this imbalance with a reference to World War II , which the Germans accepted .
but their enthusiasm has limits .
after all , aside from political under @-@ representation , Germany &apos;s annual contribution to the EU budget ( most recently € 7.4 billion ) makes the country by far the largest net contributor .
Germany finances 20 % of the EU budget but receives only 12 % of EU spending .
willingness could be exhausted if the EU budget is further expanded without reducing Germany &apos;s net contribution and narrowing the gap between its financing and voting rights .
for these reasons , German reservations also extend to the European economic government that Sarkozy advocates , and that , again , would be financed more than proportionately with German money .
Sarkozy regards an EU economic government as a way to preserve his leadership in the EU beyond France &apos;s Council presidency , which is now ending .
although the Czech Republic will assume the EU presidency in January , this has not prevented the French President from convening a new EU summit under Sarkozy &apos;s leadership in the first half of 2009 .
this affront will put not only Czech tolerance to the test , but also that of Merkel .
in the end , she will probably give in to Sarkozy &apos;s wishes in order to avoid endangering her chances of re @-@ election in September because of a conflict with the French .
but she will surely do so with clenched fists .
why Do Smart People Live Longer ?
Edinburgh - People with higher intelligence test scores in childhood and early adulthood tend to live longer .
this result has been found among people from Australia , Denmark , England and Wales , Scotland , Sweden , and the United States .
in fact , it has been found within every population that has been studied .
indeed , the impact of intelligence on mortality rivals well @-@ known risk factors for illness and death , such as high blood pressure , being overweight , high blood glucose , and high cholesterol .
its effect is almost as important as that of smoking .
differences in human intelligence have environmental and genetic causes .
an intelligence test score in early life is partly a record of what the environment has wrought on the brain and the rest of the body up to that time .
babies who have lower birth weights , for example , are more prone to chronic illnesses later in life .
they also have , on average , slightly lower intelligence .
but tests of whether birth weight might explain some of the link between intelligence and mortality have found no connection .
parents &quot; occupations are also related to their child &apos;s intelligence and later risk of illness : children from more privileged backgrounds tend to have higher intelligence and better health , and to live longer .
however , there is no convincing evidence that parental background explains the link between higher intelligence and longer life .
other researchers have viewed intelligence test scores as possibly more than just an indicator of an efficient brain .
after all , the brain is just one organ of the body , so people whose brains work well in early life may also have other organs and systems that are more efficient than others . &quot;
but this &quot; system integrity &quot; idea is somewhat vague and difficult to test .
the best we have done to date has been to examine whether people &apos;s reaction speeds are related to intelligence and to mortality .
they are .
reaction @-@ time tests involve little thinking , and merely ask people to respond as fast as they can to simple stimuli .
people who react faster have , on average , higher intelligence scores and live longer .
but we need to think of better measures of the body &apos;s integrity to test this idea more fully .
a third potential explanation is that intelligence is about good decision @-@ making .
every day , as we live our lives , we make decisions about our health : what , when , and how much to eat ; how much exercise to take ; how to look after ourselves if we have an illness ; and so forth .
therefore , the reason that intelligence and death are linked might be that people with higher intelligence in childhood make better decisions about health , and have healthier behaviors .
as adults , they tend to have better diets , exercise more , gain less weight , have fewer hangovers , and so on .
so far , so good .
but we do not yet have the full story .
there have not been any studies with data on childhood intelligence , lots of subsequent data on adult health behaviors , and then a long @-@ term follow @-@ up for deaths .
and only such a study could tell us whether it is these healthy behaviors that explain the link between intelligence and death .
a fourth type of explanation is that people with higher intelligence in childhood tend to attain better educational qualifications , work in more professional jobs , have higher incomes , and live in more affluent areas .
these variables are related to living longer , too .
so , perhaps that &apos;s it : higher intelligence buys people into safer and more health @-@ friendly environments .
certainly , in some studies , social class in adulthood seems to explain a lot of the link between intelligence and death .
the problem is that this &quot; explanation &quot; is statistical .
we are still not sure whether , say , education and occupation &quot; explain &quot; the effect of intelligence on health , or whether they are , in effect , merely surrogate measures of intelligence .
researchers have also searched for clues about the intelligence @-@ mortality link in specific types of death .
this has been revealing .
lower intelligence in early life is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from , for example , cardiovascular disease , accidents , suicide , and homicide .
the evidence for cancer is less certain .
as we have come across these specific findings , we have realized that each link might need a different explanation .
finally , we know that how intelligent we are and how long we shall live are caused by both environmental and genetic influences .
there are experimental designs , using twins , that can find out the extent to which intelligence and mortality are linked because they share environmental and genetic influences .
among the most informative exercises we can undertake in cognitive epidemiology is to obtain a large group of twins on whom there is data on early @-@ life intelligence and who were tracked for a long time to find out who had died .
we haven &apos;t yet come across a large enough group of twins with such data .
finding one is a priority .
the ultimate aim of this research is to find out what intelligent people have and do that enables them to live longer .
once we know that , we will be able to share and apply that knowledge with the aim of achieving optimal health for all .
growth Out of Time
Cambridge - Robert Gordon of Northwestern University is a distinguished economist whose work in macroeconomics and studies of long @-@ term economic growth have properly earned him high regard .
so his recent exercise in speculative future history , which asks whether economic growth in the United States has come to an end , has attracted much favorable attention .
but a basic flaw in Gordon &apos;s argument is immediately apparent - and becomes glaringly so on closer examination .
Gordon distinguishes three Industrial Revolutions that have driven economic growth and improved living standards since the eighteenth century : IR # 1 ( &quot; steam , railroads &quot; ) , whose defining inventions date from 1750 to 1830 ; IR # 2 ( &quot; electricity , internal combustion engine , running water , indoor toilets , communications , entertainment , chemicals , petroleum &quot; ) , whose defining inventions date from 1870 to 1900 ; and IR # 3 ( &quot; computers , the web , mobile phones &quot; ) , dating from 1960 .
the core of his article contrasts the transformational impact of IR # 1 and , especially , IR # 2 on per capita GDP and the quality of life with the relatively trivial consequences of IR # 3 .
the vulnerability of Gordon &apos;s argument is his shortened time horizon for IR # 3 .
consider the following four sentences in his paper :
· &quot; Both the first two revolutions required about 100 years for their full effects to percolate through the economy . &quot;
· &quot; At a minimum , it took 150 years for IR # 1 to have its full range of effects . &quot;
· &quot; The inventions of IR # 2 were so important ... that they took a full 100 years to have their main effect . &quot;
· ... &quot; &#91; T &#93; he productivity impact of IR # 3 evaporated after only eight years , compared to the 81 years ( 1891 @-@ 1972 ) required for the benefits of IR # 2 to have their full impact ... &quot;
the last sentence is crucial : Gordon cuts off IR # 3 circa 2005 - that is , 45 years from its onset , but less than half the time allowed for IR # 1 and IR # 2 to run their respective courses .
to take a salient example from the prior industrial revolutions , this is as if the impact of the railroads on the US economy were to be measured as of 1873 , 45 years after construction began on America &apos;s first line , the Baltimore &amp; Ohio .
in 1873 , the retailer Montgomery Ward was just a year old , and the first Sears Roebuck catalogue was still 20 years away .
together , these companies invented mail order as the &quot; killer app &quot; of the railroad age , creating a continental market for consumer goods , with all of the economies of scale that followed .
or , to take another example , what if we stopped measuring the economic impact of electrification only 45 years after the first generating plant , Thomas Edison &apos;s Pearl Street Station , became operational in 1882 ?
at that point , America &apos;s manufacturing industries were just discovering the benefits of flexible ( re ) configuration , which enabled distribution of generated electric power , while America &apos;s home @-@ appliance industry was in its infancy .
Gordon asserts that &quot; the era of computers replacing human labor was largely over &quot; during the past decade .
innovation in information and communications technology ( ICT ) focused first on electronic commerce , &quot; itself largely completed by 2005 . &quot;
after that , &quot; labor @-@ saving innovation &quot; took a back seat to &quot; a succession of entertainment and communication devices that do the same things as we could do before , but now in smaller and more convenient packages . &quot;
in thus truncating and trivializing the ongoing ICT revolution , Gordon misses two fundamental processes .
first , and most evident , the rise of e @-@ commerce is far from over .
in the US , the most advanced country in this respect , e @-@ commerce has just reached 10 % of total retail spending , and is continuing to grow at double @-@ digit rates through the slow recovery from the Great Recession .
at the same time , something much more significant is happening beneath the economic surface .
from the early days of the computer revolution , researchers and popularizers envisioned &quot; artificial intelligence &quot; as the ultimate killer app ( literally , in the case of the computer HAL in the film 2001 : a Space Odyssey ) .
decades of frustration are now yielding to success : the application of sophisticated statistical techniques to the accelerating accumulation of unprecedented quantities of so @-@ called Big Data that the Internet simultaneously generates and captures .
for proof of artificial intelligent &quot; life , &quot; consider the &quot; virtual assistants &quot; populating smart phones , beginning - but just beginning - with Apple &apos;s Siri .
the next wave of IR # 3 &quot; s consequences can be discerned in systems that capture the intention behind a search request and couple it to a completed transaction , and in the application of predictive analytics to industrial supply chains and service provisioning .
if these innovations &quot; prospective impact on productivity and GDP growth cannot be quantified , well , that is the way it is with future history .
flawed as Gordon &apos;s reading of IR # 3 is , his concluding concern for the future of innovation in the US is well founded .
of the assorted &quot; headwinds &quot; that he cites , the enormous increase in inequality and the plateau reached in educational attainment represent threats that differentiate America &apos;s position from that of other advanced countries .
but Gordon ignores the greatest threat to continued US global leadership in innovation : the delegitimation over the past generation of the state &apos;s role as an economic actor .
as I illustrate and analyze at length in my new book , Doing Capitalism in the Innovation Economy : markets , speculation and the State , the state has become central to the Innovation Economy &apos;s dynamics .
it funds the upstream research that generates discovery and invention ; supports the creation of new networks , from canals to the Internet ; and serves as a creative customer for innovative products , as it did during the computer revolution &apos;s nascence .
the state must also preserve continuity in the market economy when the speculative bubble that has funded its transformation bursts .
and here , too , Gordon disappoints .
the only reference to government in his paper is not even to this stabilizing role . rather , it is to the asserted headwind represented by the very debt incurred to prevent the global financial crisis of 2008 from triggering a second Great Depression .
the Truth About Sovereignty
Cambridge - In the French parliament &apos;s recent debate on Europe &apos;s new fiscal treaty , the country &apos;s Socialist government vehemently denied that ratification of the treaty would undermine French sovereignty .
it places &quot; not one constraint on the level of public spending , &quot; Jean @-@ Marc Ayrault , the prime minister , asserted . &quot; budget sovereignty remains in the parliament of the French Republic . &quot;
as Ayrault was trying to reassure his skeptical colleagues , including many members of his own party , European Commissioner for Competition Joaquin Almunia was delivering a similar message to his fellow social democrats in Brussels .
to succeed , he argued , Europe must prove wrong those who believe there is a conflict between globalization and sovereignty .
nobody likes to give up national sovereignty , least of all , it seems , politicians on the left .
yet , by denying the obvious fact that the eurozone &apos;s viability depends on substantial restraints on sovereignty , Europe &apos;s leaders are misleading their voters , delaying the Europeanization of democratic politics , and raising the political and economic costs of the ultimate reckoning .
the eurozone aspires to full economic integration , which entails the elimination of transaction costs that impede cross @-@ border commerce and finance .
obviously , it requires that governments renounce direct restrictions on trade and capital flows .
but it also requires that they harmonize their domestic rules and regulations - such as product @-@ safety standards and bank regulations - with those of other member states in order to ensure they do not act as indirect trade barriers .
and governments must forswear changes in these policies , lest the uncertainty itself act as a transaction cost .
this was all implicit in the European Union &apos;s single @-@ market initiative .
the eurozone went one step further , aiming through monetary unification to eradicate fully the transaction costs associated with national currencies and exchange @-@ rate risk .
simply put , the European integration project has hinged on restrictions on national sovereignty .
if its future is now in doubt , it is because sovereignty stands in the way once again .
in a true economic union , underpinned by union @-@ wide political institutions , the financial problems of Greece , Spain , and the others would not have blown up to their current proportions , threatening the existence of the union itself .
consider the United States .
no one even keeps track of , say , Florida &apos;s current @-@ account deficit with the rest of the country , although we can safely guess that it is huge ( since the state is home to many retirees living off benefits that come from elsewhere ) .
when Florida &apos;s state government goes bankrupt , Florida &apos;s banks continue to operate normally , because they are under federal rather than state jurisdiction .
when Florida &apos;s banks go belly @-@ up , state finances are insulated , because the banks are ultimately the responsibility of federal institutions .
when Florida &apos;s workers become unemployed , they get unemployment checks from Washington , DC .
and when Florida &apos;s voters are disenchanted about the economy , they do not riot outside the state capital ; they put pressure on their representatives in Congress to push for changes in federal policies .
nobody would argue that US states have an abundance of sovereignty .
the relationship between sovereignty and democracy is also misunderstood .
not all restrictions on the exercise of sovereign power are undemocratic .
political scientists talk about &quot; democratic delegation &quot; - the idea that a sovereign might want to tie its hands ( through international commitments or delegation to autonomous agencies ) in order to achieve better outcomes .
the delegation of monetary policy to an independent central bank is the archetypal example : in the service of price stability , daily management of monetary policy is insulated from politics .
even if selective limitations on sovereignty may enhance democratic performance , there is no guarantee that all limitations implied by market integration would do so .
in domestic politics , delegation is carefully calibrated and restricted to a few areas where the issues tend to be highly technical and partisan differences are not large .
a truly democracy @-@ enhancing globalization would respect these boundaries .
it would impose only those limits that are consistent with democratic delegation , possibly along with a limited number of procedural norms ( such as transparency , accountability , representativeness , use of scientific evidence , etc . ) that enhance democratic deliberation at home .
as the American example illustrates , it is possible to give up on sovereignty - as Florida , Texas , California , and the other US states have done - without giving up on democracy .
but combining market integration with democracy requires the creation of supranational political institutions that are representative and accountable .
the conflict between democracy and globalization becomes acute when globalization restricts the domestic articulation of policy preferences without a compensating expansion of democratic space at the regional / global level .
Europe is already on the wrong side of this boundary , as the political unrest in Spain and Greece indicates .
that is where my political trilemma begins to bite : we cannot have globalization , democracy , and national sovereignty simultaneously .
we must choose two among the three .
if European leaders want to maintain democracy , they must make a choice between political union and economic disintegration .
they must either explicitly renounce economic sovereignty or actively put it to use for the benefit of their citizens .
the first would entail coming clean with their own electorates and building democratic space above the level of the nation @-@ state .
the second would mean giving up on monetary union in order to be able to deploy national monetary and fiscal policies in the service of longer @-@ term recovery .
the longer this choice is postponed , the greater the economic and political cost that ultimately will have to be paid .
economic Policy &apos;s Narrative Imperative
Washington , DC - The best advice I received when taking up policymaking responsibilities in Turkey more than a decade ago was to take &quot; a lot of time and care to develop and communicate the &apos; narrative &quot; to support the policy program that you want to succeed . &quot;
the more that economic policy is subject to public debate - that is , the more democracy there is - the more important such policy narratives are .
the crisis faced by the European Union and the eurozone is a telling example of the need for a narrative that explains public policy and generates political support for it .
a successful narrative can be neither too complicated nor simplistic .
it must capture the imagination , address the public &apos;s anxieties , and generate realistic hope .
voters often sense cheap populism .
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi provided such a narrative to the financial markets last July .
he said that the ECB would do everything necessary to prevent the disintegration of the euro , adding simply : &quot; believe me , it will be enough . &quot;
with that sentence , Draghi eliminated the perceived re @-@ denomination tail risk that was highest in the case of Greece , but that was driving up borrowing costs in Spain , Italy , and Portugal as well .
it was not a populist message , because the ECB does indeed have the firepower to buy enough sovereign bonds on the secondary market to put a ceiling on interest rates , at least for many months .
central bankers , more generally , are typically able to provide short- or medium @-@ term narratives to financial markets .
US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke provided his own by pledging that US short @-@ term interest rates would remain very low , and the Bank of Japan &apos;s new chairman , Haruhiko Kuroda , has just provided another by saying that he will double the money supply so that inflation reaches 2 % .
while central bankers can provide such narratives to financial markets , it is political leaders who must provide the overall socioeconomic messages that encourage long @-@ term real investment , electoral support for reform , and hope for the future .
central bank alchemy , to borrow a term from the US journalist Neil Irwin &apos;s new book , has its limits .
Europe , in particular , needs a narrative of long @-@ term hope that will trigger a real recovery .
France is coming closer to the danger zone , and even Germany &apos;s annual GDP growth is falling well below 1 % per year .
in the meantime , the easing of sovereign interest @-@ rate spreads provides little comfort to the growing army of unemployed in southern Europe , where youth unemployment has reached dramatic heights - close to 60 % in Greece and Spain , and almost 40 % in Italy .
the narrative should address three essential questions .
how can the European model of strong social solidarity and security be reformed , but endure ?
how can economic growth be revived and sustained throughout the EU ?
and how can Europe &apos;s institutions function with enhanced legitimacy to accommodate countries that share the euro and others that retain their national currencies ?
for starters , a revolution is required in the organization of work , learning , and leisure .
social solidarity , essential to European identity , can and must include longer work lives , but also more work @-@ sharing , adult learning , and shorter average work weeks ( particularly close to retirement ) .
such flexibility requires the consent of all : employees must adjust to changing requirements ; employers must re @-@ organize their enterprises to allow more work @-@ sharing , work from home , and learning intervals ; and governments must overhaul taxes , income support , and regulation to promote a &quot; flex @-@ solidarity revolution &quot; that encourages personal choice and responsibility , while remaining committed to social cohesion .
this can lead to a better future for all , with citizens gaining better access to adult education , having more free time to pursue personal interests , and remaining productive and occupationally engaged far longer into their healthy lives .
Europe does not need Asia &apos;s rates of economic growth .
it can secure decent jobs and prosperity , with a sustained annual growth rate of around 2 % .
to achieve that , German voters should be told not that their country &apos;s resources will forever flow to Spain , but that their wages can rise at twice the rate of the recent past without risking inflation or a current @-@ account deficit , because Germany has the world &apos;s largest external surplus .
service @-@ sector industries throughout the EU must be opened up .
the countries with stronger fiscal positions should take the lead in a major pan @-@ European skill @-@ upgrading program .
the number of pan @-@ European scholarships should be doubled .
school programs everywhere should aim to educate trilingual citizens .
moreover , a full European banking union with shared resources for resolution should be created without further delay .
the European Investment Bank , which received a significant capital increase in 2012 , should add a large investment @-@ support program for medium @-@ size enterprises to its current operations , with a subsidy financed from the European budget to encourage first @-@ time job takers for a limited period .
jobs and training for young people must be the centerpiece for the new growth pact , and projects must move ahead in &quot; crisis mode , &quot; rather than according to business as usual .
finally , while monetary union obviously requires greater sharing of sovereignty , there should also be a &quot; greater Europe &quot; that includes the United Kingdom and others .
this implies two @-@ tier institutions that can accommodate both types of countries : the &quot; euro @-@ ins &quot; and those that prefer to preserve their monetary sovereignty in a larger Europe built around a vibrant single market and common democratic values .
these interconnected visions can and must be realized if Europe is to thrive again .
together , they form a compelling narrative that European leaders must begin to articulate .
why Eurobonds are UN @-@ American
Brussels - The emerging consensus in Europe nowadays is that only &quot; debt mutualization &quot; in the form of Eurobonds can resolve the euro crisis , with advocates frequently citing the early United States , when Alexander Hamilton , President George Washington &apos;s treasury secretary , successfully pressed the new federal government to assume the Revolutionary War debts of America &apos;s states .
but a closer look reveals that this early US experience provides neither a useful analogy nor an encouraging precedent for Eurobonds .
first , taking over a stock of existing state debt at the federal level is very different from allowing individual member states to issue bonds with &quot; joint and several &quot; liability underwritten by all member states collectively .
Hamilton did not have to worry about moral hazard , because the federal government did not guarantee any new debt incurred by the states .
second , it is seldom mentioned that US federal debt at the time ( around $ 40 million ) was much larger than that of the states ( about $ 18 million ) .
thus , assuming state debt was not central to the success of post @-@ war financial stabilization in the new country ; rather , it was a natural corollary of the fact that most of the debt had been incurred fighting for a common cause .
moreover , the most efficient sources of government revenues at the time were tariffs and taxes collected at the external border .
even from an efficiency point of view , it made sense to have the federal government service public debt .
Federal assumption of the states &quot; war debts also yielded an advantage in terms of economic development : once states no longer had any debt , they had no need to raise any revenues through direct taxation , which might have impeded the growth of America &apos;s internal market .
indeed , after the federal government assumed the states &quot; debt ( already a small part of the total ) , state revenues fell by 80 @-@ 90 % .
the states then became for some time fiscally irrelevant .
finally , the key to the success of financial stabilization was a profound restructuring .
Hamilton estimated that the federal government could raise enough revenues to pay approximately 4 % interest on the total amount of debt to be serviced - significantly less than the 6 % yield on the existing obligations .
holders of both state and federal bonds were thus offered a basket of long @-@ dated bonds , some with an interest rate of 3 % , and others with 6 % ( with a ten @-@ year grace period ) .
the basket was designed in such a way as to result in an average debt @-@ service cost of 4 % .
in modern terms , the &quot; net present value &quot; of the total debt ( federal and state ) was reduced by about one @-@ half if one were to apply the usual exit yield of 9 % .
moreover , the new federal bonds &quot; very long maturities meant that there was no rollover risk .
it would have been very dangerous to expose the federal government to this danger , given that the operation was rightly perceived at the outset as extremely risky .
for the country &apos;s first few years , debt service swallowed more than 80 % of all federal revenues .
the slightest negative shock could have bankrupted the new federal government .
fortunately , the opposite happened : Federal revenues tripled under the impact of a rapid post @-@ war reconstruction boom , and continued to grow rapidly , aided by the country &apos;s ability to remain neutral while wars ravaged the European continent .
by contrast , growth prospects in Europe today are rather dim , and interest payments , even for Greece or Italy , account for less than 20 % of total revenues .
the real problem is the rollover of existing debt in a stagnating economy .
for example , Italy will soon have a balanced budget in structural terms , but must still face the problem of refinancing old debt as it matures each year .
assuaging doubt about the sustainability of public debt in the eurozone would thus probably require a deep restructuring as well .
the eurozone crisis could certainly be resolved if all existing public debt were transformed into 20 @-@ year Eurobonds with a yield of 3 % , and a five @-@ year grace period on debt service .
one can easily anticipate the impact that this would have on financial markets .
more interesting in view of the current situation in the eurozone is what followed roughly a half @-@ century after Hamilton acted .
in the 1830 &quot; s and 1840 &quot; s , a number of states had over @-@ invested in the leading transport technology of the time - canals .
when the canal @-@ building boom ended , eight states and the Territory of Florida ( accounting for about 10 % of the entire US population at the time ) were unable to service their debt and defaulted on their , mostly British , loans .
British bankers threatened that they would never again invest in these untrustworthy Americans .
they could point to the precedent set by Hamilton , and had probably invested on the implicit understanding that , if necessary , the federal government would bail out the states again .
but , despite foreign creditors &quot; threats , the federal government did not come to the rescue .
the bailout request did not succeed because it could not muster a simple majority of the states ( represented by the Senate ) and the population ( represented by the House of Representatives ) under the normal decision @-@ making procedure ( the &quot; Community method , &quot; in European Union jargon ) .
the defaults proved to be costly .
the 1840 &quot; s were a period of slow growth , and continued pressure from foreign creditors forced most of the official debtors to resume payments after a while .
default was not an easy way out , and all US states ( with the exception of Vermont ) have since embraced balanced @-@ budget amendments to their constitutions as a way to shore up their fiscal credibility .
are EU members prepared to take a similar step ?
Europe &apos;s Asian Pivot
Cambridge / Oxford - The Obama administration &apos;s so @-@ called &quot; pivot to Asia &quot; is the most important strategic shift that the United States has undertaken since the end of the Cold War - and it has profound implications for Europe .
but Europe &apos;s leaders have largely ignored or misunderstood its significance , and thus have failed to seize the opportunity that it represents .
for example , some in Europe believe that America &apos;s interest in Asia is a recent development .
but , as President Barack Obama put it in 2011 , &quot; The US has been , and always will be , a Pacific nation . &quot;
the shift is aimed at ensuring that the US plays &quot; a larger and long @-@ term role in shaping this region , &quot; where it has long helped to maintain stability and contributed to unprecedented economic growth .
given this , America &apos;s pivot should be viewed more as a consolidation of established policies than as an abrupt , short @-@ term change .
the policy &apos;s scope is also widely misunderstood .
while the policy does include a rebalancing of America &apos;s military posture in Asia - by 2020 , the US Navy will deploy more of its forces , including six of its 11 carrier groups , to the Pacific Ocean - it covers the entire spectrum of diplomacy , economics , development , culture , and inter @-@ societal relations .
this comprehensive approach is evident in Obama &apos;s choice of destination for the first overseas trip of his second term .
by visiting Myanmar , Thailand , and Cambodia , Obama reinforced earlier efforts to strengthen diplomatic and economic engagement with the Asia @-@ Pacific region .
furthermore , America officially joined the East Asia Summit in 2011 , easing concerns in the region about China &apos;s increasingly aggressive posture in the South China Sea .
likewise , America &apos;s proposed Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership and offers of economic engagement to Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) countries are the latest initiatives underscoring its determination to strengthen its economic ties in the region .
such efforts to safeguard regional stability will ultimately benefit Europe , for which Asia has become an increasingly important trading partner .
given the rising risk of conflict in Asia - owing to a toxic combination of rapid GDP growth , an arms race , historical resentments , rampant chauvinism , territorial disputes , and a lack of effective institutional arrangements for conflict resolution - Europe should welcome a stronger US presence in the region .
at the same time , Europe &apos;s leaders must recognize that , by increasing its engagement in Asia , the US is not turning away from its European partners .
on the contrary , as US Vice President Joe Biden said in February , Europe remains &quot; the cornerstone of &#91; US &#93; engagement with the rest of the world . &quot;
US leaders are well aware of the geopolitical factors that make Europe their most important and reliable ally .
its proximity to the Middle East and Africa - where the European Union and its member countries are the most important aid donors , trading partners , and security actors - will ensure the partnership &apos;s continued relevance , as will the common values and deep economic integration that underpin transatlantic relations .
but the rebalancing does have strategic implications for Europe .
America &apos;s military presence in Europe will be gradually reduced , as will its willingness to take the lead in international crises - even those affecting Europe &apos;s interests .
as a result , while the US will continue to provide intelligence , air support , and ammunition on a case @-@ by @-@ case basis , as it did recently in Libya and Mali , Europe will increasingly have to act first and alone .
if Europe is to overcome its current financial constraints and acquire the military capacity and level of coordination needed to fulfill its new role , it must pool and share its resources more effectively .
furthermore , whether on a bilateral basis , through NATO , or through the EU , France &apos;s insistence on military sovereignty must be reconciled with Germany &apos;s culture of excessive military restraint .
failure to share resources and coordinate policy would seriously undermine Europe &apos;s security interests .
the US rebalancing will also create an opportunity for Europe to play a greater role in an increasingly important region .
by joining the US in the rebalancing process and supporting relations with China that are built on cooperation rather than containment , the EU would contribute to global stability , while spreading European values .
to this end , the EU can leverage its position as a leading trading partner , investor , and aid donor ; it can also contribute at leaders &quot; summits , such as the Asia @-@ Europe Meeting and the ASEAN Regional Forum .
the Obama administration seems to understand the potential benefits of such a &quot; joint rebalancing , &quot; with the EU @-@ US statement on the Asia @-@ Pacific region issued last July suggesting a move toward policy coordination .
but , in pursuing such harmonization , Europeans should recognize that their Asia strategy - which has so far focused on commerce and , to a lesser degree , on the rule of law and human rights - will have to take on a security dimension .
indeed , if conflicts in Asia become more virulent , Europe cannot expect the US to shoulder the burden of maintaining regional stability alone .
while this does not necessarily imply a military role for Europe in Asia ( although participation in peacekeeping missions should not be excluded ) , it does mean a more forceful diplomatic posture in support of mediation and multilateralism .
a joint rebalancing would help to fortify all facets of the EU @-@ US relationship , possibly catalyzing progress on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership .
it would also strengthen the largest economies &quot; rule @-@ making capacity vis @-@ à @-@ vis the emerging economies , most notably China , in maintaining a liberal economic order .
in short , a common approach toward Asia would reinvigorate the transatlantic relationship at just the right time , and would guarantee that , despite having suffered from internal disagreements in the last decade , the EU @-@ US partnership remains the cornerstone of a peaceful and prosperous world order .
why Fair Trade ?
London - historically , the term &quot; fair trade &quot; has meant many things .
the Fair Trade League was founded in Britain in 1881 to restrict imports from foreign countries .
in the United States , businesses and labor unions use &quot; fair trade &quot; laws to construct what economist Joseph Stiglitz calls &quot; barbed @-@ wire barriers to imports . &quot;
these so called &quot; anti @-@ dumping &quot; laws allow a company that suspects a foreign rival of selling a product below cost to request that the government impose special tariffs to protect it from &quot; unfair &quot; competition .
such dark protectionist thoughts are far from the minds of the benevolent organizers of the United Kingdom &apos;s annual &quot; Fairtrade fortnight , &quot; during which I just bought two bars of fair @-@ trade chocolate and a jar of fair @-@ trade chunky peanut butter .
their worthy aim is to raise the price paid to developing @-@ country farmers for their produce by excluding the inflated profits of the middlemen on whom they depend for getting their goods to distant markets .
fair @-@ trade products like cocoa , coffee , tea , and bananas do not compete with domestic European production , and therefore do not have a protectionist motive .
this is how it works : in exchange for being paid a guaranteed price and meeting &quot; agreed labor and environmental standards &quot; ( minimum wages , no pesticides ) , poor @-@ country farming cooperatives receive a FAIRTRADE mark for their products , issued by the FAIRTRADE labeling Organization .
this certification enables supermarkets and other retailers to sell the products at a premium .
third @-@ world farmers get a boost to their income , while first @-@ world consumers get to feel virtuous : a marriage made in heaven .
the fair @-@ trade movement , launched in the 1980 &quot; s , has been growing rapidly .
in a notable breakthrough in 1997 , the British House of Commons decided to serve only fair @-@ trade coffee .
by the end of 2007 , more than 600 producers &quot; organizations , representing 1.4 million farmers in 58 countries , were selling fair @-@ trade products .
today , a quarter of all bananas in UK supermarkets are sold under a FAIRTRADE mark .
but FAIRTRADE @-@ labeled products still represent a very small share - typically less than 1 % - of global sales of cocoa , tea , coffee , etc .
the economic rationale for guaranteed prices is well known : stabilizing the prices of primary products , which are subject to sharp fluctuations , stabilizes their producers &quot; incomes .
this argument inspired proposals - most famously by John Maynard Keynes in 1942 - to create &quot; buffer stocks &quot; for the main commodities , which would take supply off the market when prices fell , and add to supply when prices rose .
Keynes &apos;s proposal never made it into the Bretton Woods Agreement of 1944 , and , while buffer @-@ stock schemes re @-@ surfaced in the 1970 &quot; s , they , too , went nowhere .
left @-@ wing economists like Raúl Prebisch , moreover , later advanced the theory of &quot; declining terms of trade &quot; for primary products : their prices &quot; long @-@ run tendency to fall relative to the prices of manufactured goods .
this tendency seemed to be at work from the mid @-@ 1980 &quot; s , as commodity producers experienced a persistent decline in prices .
in addition , price fluctuations throughout that decade were huge , with dire effects on sub @-@ Saharan African and other developing countries that were largely dependent on commodities for export earnings .
since then , however , the price decline has been reversed .
food commodity prices have increased by 150 % since 2001 .
this has raised farm producers &quot; income independently of the fair @-@ trade movement &apos;s efforts .
the &quot; declining terms of trade &quot; argument has collapsed .
but primary @-@ product prices remain much more volatile than the prices of manufactured goods and services , causing large fluctuations in producers &quot; incomes .
this exaggerates the effects of booms and busts .
so the issue of price stabilization has not gone away .
it is difficult to see how the fair @-@ trade movement can contribute much to solving this problem , because the only serious policy for stabilizing producers &quot; incomes is to control supply . but that is beyond the scope of fair trade .
the target of all versions of fair trade is &quot; free trade , &quot; and the most damaging attacks on FAIRTRADE have come from free traders .
in Unfair Trade , a pamphlet published in 2008 by the Adam Smith Institute , Mark Sidwell argues that FAIRTRADE keeps uncompetitive farmers on the land , holding back diversification and mechanization .
according to Sidwell , the FAIRTRADE scheme turns developing countries into low @-@ profit , labor @-@ intensive agrarian ghettos , denying future generations the chance of a better life .
this is without considering the effect that FAIRTRADE has on the poorest people in these countries - not farmers but casual laborers - who are excluded from the scheme by its expensive regulations and labor standards .
in other words , FAIRTRADE protects farmers against their rivals and against agricultural laborers .
consumers , Sidwell argues , are also being duped .
only a tiny proportion - as little as 1 % - of the premium that we pay for a FAIRTRADE chocolate bar will ever make it to cocoa producers .
nor is FAIRTRADE necessarily a guarantee of quality : because producers get a minimum price for fair @-@ trade goods , they sell the best of their crop on the open market .
but , despite its shaky economics , the fair @-@ trade movement should not be despised .
while cynics say that its only achievement is to make consumers feel better about their purchases - rather like buying indulgences in the old Catholic Church - this is to sell fair trade short .
in fact , the movement represents a spark of protest against mindless consumerism , grass @-@ roots resistance against an impersonal logic , and an expression of communal activism .
that justification will not convince economists , who prefer a dryer sort of reasoning .
but it is not out of place to remind ourselves that economists and bureaucrats need not always have things their own way .
is US Monetary Policy Made in China ?
Amsterdam - For much of the year , investors have been fixated on when the Fed will achieve &quot; liftoff &quot; - that is , when it will raise interest rates by 25 basis points , or 0.25 % , as a first step toward normalizing monetary conditions .
markets have soared and plummeted in response to small changes in Fed statements perceived as affecting the likelihood that liftoff is imminent .
but , in seeking to gauge changes in US monetary conditions , investors have been looking in the wrong place .
since mid @-@ August , when Chinese policymakers startled the markets by devaluing the renminbi by 2 % , China &apos;s official intervention in foreign @-@ exchange markets has continued , in order to prevent the currency from falling further .
the Chinese authorities have been selling foreign securities , mainly United States Treasury bonds , and buying up renminbi .
this is the opposite of what China did when the renminbi was strong .
back then , China bought US Treasury bonds to keep the currency from rising and eroding the competitiveness of Chinese exporters .
as a result , it accumulated an astounding $ 4 trillion of foreign reserves .
and what was true of China was also true of other emerging @-@ market countries receiving capital inflows .
these countries &quot; foreign reserves , mainly held in US securities , topped $ 8 trillion at their peak last year .
the effects of these purchases attracted considerable attention .
in 2005 , US Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan pointed to the phenomenon as an explanation for his famous &quot; conundrum &quot; : interest rates on Treasury bonds were lower than market conditions appeared to warrant .
his successor , Ben Bernanke , similarly pointed to purchases of US debt by foreign central banks and governments as a reason why American interest rates were so low .
now this process has gone into reverse .
although no one outside official Chinese circles knows the exact magnitude of China &apos;s foreign @-@ exchange intervention , informed guesses suggest that it has been running at roughly $ 100 billion a month since mid @-@ August .
observers believe that roughly 60 % of China &apos;s liquid reserves are in US Treasury bills .
given that reserve managers prefer to avoid unbalancing their carefully composed portfolios , they probably have been selling Treasuries at a rate of roughly $ 60 billion a month .
the effects are analogous - but opposite - to those of quantitative easing .
recall that the Fed began its third round of quantitative easing ( QE3 ) by purchasing $ 40 billion of securities a month , before boosting the volume to $ 85 billion .
monthly sales of $ 60 billion by China &apos;s government would lie squarely in the middle .
estimates of the effects of QE3 differ .
but the weight of the evidence is that QE3 had a modest but significant downward impact on Treasury yields and a positive effect on demand for riskier assets .
Menzie Chinn of the University of Wisconsin has examined the impact of foreign purchases and sales of US government securities on ten @-@ year Treasury yields .
his estimates imply that foreign sales at a rate of $ 60 billion per month raise yields by ten basis points .
given that China has been at it for 2.5 months , this implies that the equivalent of a 25 @-@ basis @-@ point increase in interest rates has already been injected into the market .
some would object that the renminbi is weak because China is experiencing capital outflows by private investors , and that some of this private money also flows into US financial markets . this is technically correct , but it is already factored into the changes in interest rates described above .
recall that capital also flowed out of the US when the Fed was engaged in QE , without vitiating the effects . that was what the earlier debate over &quot; currency wars &quot; - when emerging markets complained about being inundated by financial inflows from the US - was all about .
another objection is that QE operates not just through the so @-@ called portfolio channel - by changing the mix of securities in the market - but also through the expectations channel .
it signals that the authorities are seriously committed to making the future different from the past .
but if Chinese intervention is just a one @-@ off event , and there are no expectations of it continuing , then this second channel shouldn &apos;t be operative , and the impact will be smaller than that of QE .
the problem is that no one knows how long capital outflows from China will persist or how long the Chinese authorities will continue to intervene .
from this standpoint , the Fed &apos;s decision to wait to begin liftoff is eminently sensible .
and , given that China holds ( and is therefore now selling ) euros as well , the European Central Bank also should bear this in mind when it decides in December whether to ramp up its own program of quantitative easing .
why Finance Can Save the Planet
Paris - Most people hate finance , viewing it as the epitome of irresponsibility and greed .
but , even after causing a once @-@ in @-@ a @-@ century recession and unemployment for millions , finance looks indispensable for preventing an even worse catastrophe : climate change .
action is urgently needed to contain global warming and prevent a disaster for humanity ; yet the global community is desperately short of tools .
there is not much support for the most desirable solutions advocated by economists , such as a global cap on greenhouse @-@ gas emissions , coupled with a trading system , or the enforcement of a worldwide carbon price through a global tax on CO2 emissions .
instead , negotiations for the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris in December are being conducted on the basis of voluntary , unilateral pledges called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions .
although the inclusion of voluntary targets has the merit of creating global momentum , this approach is unlikely to result in commitments that are both binding and commensurate to the challenge .
that is why climate advocates are increasingly looking for other means of triggering action .
finance is at the top of their list .
for starters , finance provides an accurate yardstick to gauge if deeds are consistent with words .
in 2011 , &quot; Unburnable Carbon , &quot; a path @-@ breaking report by the nongovernmental Carbon Tracker Initiative , showed that the proven fossil @-@ fuel reserves owned by governments and private companies exceed by a factor of five the quantity of carbon that can be burned in the next 50 years if global warming is to be kept below two degrees Celsius .
reserves held just by the 200 top publicly listed fuel companies - thus excluding state @-@ owned producers such as Saudi Arabia &apos;s Aramco - exceed this carbon budget by one @-@ third .
and that means that these companies &quot; stock @-@ market valuation is inconsistent with containing global warning .
this realization prompted a campaign to convince investors to divest from carbon @-@ rich assets .
individuals and institutions representing a $ 2.6 trillion portfolio have already joined the divestment movement .
furthermore , Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has highlighted the threat represented by potentially stranded carbon assets .
investors are being warned that , from the standpoint of financial stability , &quot; brown &quot; securities bear specific risk .
the amount of divestment may look big - and it is , particularly given that the campaign started recently .
yet $ 2.6 trillion amounts to less than 5 % of global private non @-@ financial securities .
the trend is real , but it is still too little to trigger significant changes in fossil @-@ fuel companies &quot; valuation and behavior .
a second reason why finance matters is that the transition to a low @-@ carbon economy requires huge investments .
according to the International Energy Agency , global investment in energy supply currently amounts to $ 1.6 trillion annually , and 70 % of it is still based on oil , coal , or gas .
green investment amounts to only 15 % of the total , and investment in energy efficiency - in buildings , transport , and industry - totals a meager $ 130 billion .
containing the increase in average surface temperature to two degrees requires developing clean technologies , and even more important , a four @-@ fold increase in investment in energy efficiency over the next ten years .
yet such investment will not be financed easily : its return depends on a still @-@ elusive carbon price and will often materialize only in the long run , while improving energy efficiency implies replacing hundreds of millions of outdated vehicles and refitting hundreds of millions of energy @-@ voracious buildings .
adequate financing instruments are required for the right purpose at the right place and at the right scale .
development banks and green banks have a huge role to play .
for example , dedicated long @-@ term loans , coupled with a tax break or a subsidy , would help households decide to modernize their homes .
but the real hope among climate specialists is that innovative finance could help provide the planning clarity that is currently missing .
to elicit the investments that are necessary to mitigate climate change and green the economy , the elimination of fossil @-@ fuel subsidies and a credible , fast @-@ rising path for the price of carbon are vital .
but , because high fuel prices are unpopular with consumers and raise competitiveness concerns among businesses , governments are reluctant to take action today - and may renege on their commitments to act tomorrow .
to overcome such trepidation , advocates for climate action are turning to incentives .
some have recommended that governments issue CO2 performance bonds , whose yield would be reduced if companies exceed their carbon target .
another idea , put forward in a recent paper by Michel Aglietta and his colleagues , is to map out a path for an indicative price of carbon called its &quot; social value &quot; and provide green project developers a government @-@ guaranteed carbon certificate representing the value of the corresponding emissions reduction .
central banks , they suggest , would then refinance loans to such developers , up to the value of the carbon certificate .
this would amount to a calculated bet .
if the price of carbon in , say , ten years , actually corresponds to the announced social value , the project will be profitable and the developer will repay the loan .
but if the government reneges on its commitment , the developer will default , leaving the central bank with a claim on the government .
failure to increase the price of carbon would result either in higher public debt or , in the case of monetization , inflation .
the idea is to force governments to have skin in the game , by balancing the risk of inaction on the carbon tax with the risk of insolvency or inflation .
there would be no procrastination .
action against global warming would take place without delay .
but a decade or so later , governments - and societies more broadly - would need to choose between taxation , debt , and inflation .
undertaking massive investment now and deciding only later how to finance it looks irresponsible - and so it is .
but not acting at all would be even more irresponsible .
banking Reform &apos;s Fear Factor
Washington , DC - Nearly five years after the worst financial crisis since the 1930 &quot; s , and three years after the enactment of the Dodd @-@ Frank financial reforms in the United States , one question is on everyone &apos;s mind : why have we made so little progress ?
new rules have been promised , but very few have actually been implemented .
there is not yet a &quot; Volcker Rule &quot; ( limiting proprietary trading by banks ) , the rules for derivatives are still a work @-@ in @-@ progress , and money @-@ market funds remain unreformed . even worse , our biggest banks have become even larger .
there is no sign that they have abandoned the incentive structure that encourages excessive risk @-@ taking .
and the great distortions from being &quot; too big to fail &quot; loom large over many economies .
there are three possible explanations for what has gone wrong .
one is that financial reform is inherently complicated .
but , though many technical details need to be fleshed out , some of the world &apos;s smartest people work in the relevant regulatory agencies .
they are more than capable of writing and enforcing rules - that is , when this is what they are really asked to do .
the second explanation focuses on conflict among agencies with overlapping jurisdictions , both within and across countries .
again , there is an element of truth to this ; but we have also seen a great deal of coordination even on the most complex topics - such as how much equity big banks should have , or how the potential failure of such a firm should be handled .
that leaves the final explanation : those in charge of financial reform really did not want to make rapid progress .
in both the US and Europe , government leaders are gripped by one overriding fear : that their economies will slip back into recession - or worse .
the big banks play on this fear , arguing that financial reform will cause them to become unprofitable and make them unable to lend , or that there will be some other dire unintended consequence .
there has been a veritable avalanche of lobbying on this point , which has resulted in top officials moving slowly , for fear of damaging the economy .
but this is a grave mistake - based on a failure to understand how big banks can damage the economy .
higher equity @-@ capital requirements , for example , require banks to fund themselves with relatively more equity and relatively less debt .
this makes them safer , because they are more able to absorb losses , and less likely to become zombie banks ( which do not make sensible loans ) .
the banks claim that higher capital requirements and other regulations will drive up the cost of credit .
but there is no sign of any such effect - a point made , rather belatedly , in the Federal Reserve &apos;s monetary policy report to the US Congress last week .
on the contrary , the biggest US banks are reporting very healthy profits for the last quarter .
unfortunately , a big part of these banks &quot; profits stems from trading securities - exactly the sort of high @-@ risk activity that got them into trouble in the run @-@ up to the 2008 global financial crisis .
these are highly leveraged businesses , typically funding their balance sheets with no more than 5 % equity ( and thus 95 % debt ) .
to understand why this is a problem , consider what happens when you buy a house with just 5 % down ( or less than 3 % down , which is a better analogy for some European banks ) .
if house prices go up , you make a good return on your equity ( and a better return than if you had put 20 % down ) .
but if house prices go down , your equity may well be wiped out ( which is what it means to be underwater on your mortgage ) .
higher equity @-@ capital requirements for banks are good for the broader economy - they make financial crises ( and the zombie @-@ syndrome ) less likely , less severe , or both .
US banks are currently funded with more equity than was the case before the financial crisis , and they are doing fine .
nonetheless , we should still worry about their ability to blow themselves up in a novel and creative fashion - hence the need for the Volcker Rule , derivatives reform , and new rules for money @-@ market funds .
and equity @-@ capital requirements for large , systemically important financial institutions remain too low .
the latest indications are that US policymakers are finally starting to focus on this point .
many European banks , however , have less equity than their US counterparts , which creates an important source of vulnerability going forward .
if there is to be a broad @-@ based European recovery , the banks must raise more equity , thereby strengthening their ability to absorb potential losses .
unfortunately , there is little sign that European policymakers understand this point .
instead , senior officials in Europe think and talk like US policymakers did three years ago .
they are wary of rocking the financial boat , so they go easy on financial reform and refuse to insist on more equity capital for banks .
this is a mistake that they - and possibly all of us - may come to regret .
models Behaving Badly
London - &quot; Why did no one see the crisis coming ? &quot;
Queen Elizabeth II asked economists during a visit to the London School of Economics at the end of 2008 .
four years later , the repeated failure of economic forecasters to predict the depth and duration of the slump would have elicited a similar question from the queen : why the overestimate of recovery ?
consider the facts . in its 2011 forecast , the International Monetary Fund predicted that the European economy would grow by 2.1 % in 2012 .
in fact , it looks certain to shrink this year by 0.2 % .
in the United Kingdom , the 2010 forecast of the Office for Budget Responsibility ( OBR ) projected 2.6 % growth in 2011 and 2.8 % growth in 2012 ; in fact , the UK economy grew by 0.9 % in 2011 and will flat @-@ line in 2012 .
the OECD &apos;s latest forecast for eurozone GDP in 2012 is 2.3 % lower than its projection in 2010 .
likewise , the IMF now predicts that the European economy will be 7.8 % smaller in 2015 than it thought just two years ago .
some forecasters are more pessimistic than others ( the OBR has a particularly sunny disposition ) , but no one , it seems , has been pessimistic enough .
economic forecasting is necessarily imprecise : too many things happen for forecasters to be able to foresee all of them .
so judgment calls and best guesses are an inevitable part of &quot; scientific &quot; economic forecasts .
but imprecision is one thing ; the systematic overestimate of the economic recovery in Europe is quite another .
indeed , the figures have been repeatedly revised , even over quite short periods of time , casting strong doubt on the validity of the economic models being used .
these models , and the institutions using them , rely on a built @-@ in theory of the economy , which enables them to &quot; assume &quot; certain relationships .
it is among these assumptions that the source of the errors must lie .
two key mistakes stand out .
the models used by all of the forecasting organizations dramatically underestimated the fiscal multiplier : the impact of changes in government spending on output .
second , they overestimated the extent to which quantitative easing ( QE ) by the monetary authorities - that is , printing money - could counterbalance fiscal tightening .
until recently , the OBR , broadly in line with the IMF , assumed a fiscal multiplier of 0.6 : for every dollar cut from government spending , the economy would shrink by only 60 cents .
this assumes &quot; Ricardian equivalence &quot; : debt @-@ financed public spending at least partly crowds out private spending through its impact on expectations and confidence .
if households and firms anticipate a tax increase in the future as a result of government borrowing today , they will reduce their consumption and investment accordingly .
on this view , if fiscal austerity relieves households of the burden of future tax increases , they will increase their spending .
this may be true when the economy is operating at full employment - when state and market are in competition for every last resource .
but when there is spare capacity in the economy , the resources &quot; freed up &quot; by public @-@ sector retrenchment may simply be wasted .
forecasting organizations are finally admitting that they underestimated the fiscal multiplier .
the OBR , reviewing its recent mistakes , accepted that &quot; the average &#91; fiscal &#93; multiplier over the two years would have needed to be 1.3 - more than double our estimate - to fully explain the weak level of GDP in 2011 @-@ 12 . &quot;
the IMF has conceded that &quot; multipliers have actually been in the 0.9 and 1.7 range since the Great Recession . &quot;
the effect of underestimating the fiscal multiplier has been systematic misjudgment of the damage that &quot; fiscal consolidation &quot; does to the economy .
this leads us to the second mistake .
forecasters assumed that monetary expansion would provide an effective antidote to fiscal contraction .
the Bank of England hoped that by printing £ 375 billion of new money , ( $ 600 billion ) , it would stimulate total spending to the tune of £ 50 billion , or 3 % of GDP .
but the evidence emerging from successive rounds of QE in the UK and the US suggests that while it did lower bond yields , the extra money was largely retained within the banking system , and never reached the real economy .
this implies that the problem has mainly been a lack of demand for credit - reluctance on the part of businesses and households to borrow on almost any terms in a flat market .
these two mistakes compounded each other : if the negative impact of austerity on economic growth is greater than was originally assumed , and the positive impact of quantitative easing is weaker , then the policy mix favored by practically all European governments has been hugely wrong .
there is much greater scope for fiscal stimulus to boost growth , and much smaller scope for monetary stimulus .
this is all quite technical , but it matters a great deal for the welfare of populations .
all of these models assume outcomes on the basis of existing policies .
their consistent over @-@ optimism about these policies &quot; impact on economic growth validates pursuing them , and enables governments to claim that their remedies are &quot; working , &quot; when they clearly are not .
this is a cruel deception .
before they can do any good , the forecasters must go back to the drawing board , and ask themselves whether the theories of the economy underpinning their models are the right ones .
Hollande in Mali
Paris - While hundreds of thousands demonstrated in Paris against the right of homosexual couples to marry and adopt children , French troops were arriving in Mali to stop a coalition of Islamist and rebel forces from taking control of its capital , Bamako , and creating in the Sahel a sanctuary for terrorists .
these are trying times for French President François Hollande .
besieged economically at home , where his popularity is at its lowest since his election last year , can he regain credibility , if not support , as supreme commander of French forces ?
once upon a time , &quot; I intervene , therefore I am &quot; might as well have been a French motto , particularly in Africa .
but , while French national identity is intimately bound up with France &apos;s international standing - how it is perceived in the world - enthusiasm for intervention has receded .
the benefits have become more dubious , while the costs and risks have grown increasingly evident .
if France has again become a regional gendarme by default , it is largely for three reasons .
American enthusiasm for intervention in Africa has greatly diminished since the operation in Somalia in 1992 @-@ 1993 - and more globally following the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
European interest in military intervention in Africa is as low as ever .
and , as for the region &apos;s governments , it would be an understatement to say that they are not yet ready militarily to take their fate into their own hands .
while France is not alone - manifestations of support have come from its Western and African partners , as well as from the Middle East - it will bear the primary responsibility and the risks .
for Islamic fundamentalists , France is now the &quot; Great Satan . &quot;
indeed , the conflict in Mali is taking place geographically in Africa , but in many ways its causes and ramifications lie in the Middle East .
when France intervened in an African country in the past , there was no risk of terrorist attacks on its territory or on its citizens elsewhere in the world .
that is no longer the case .
it is too early to say what will happen in Mali or the Sahel - or , for that matter , in France itself .
for the moment , the French are standing , overwhelmingly , behind Hollande .
they would have criticized him had he remained passive while Bamako fell into the hands of terrorists .
yet this support may be fragile , and could collapse if something goes wrong on the ground - or , worse , in France .
before the intervention , Mali was not a French priority .
rising unemployment at home seemed to be a more urgent task than did addressing instability in Africa .
while the French public agrees that Mali cannot be allowed to become a haven for terrorists , the way Afghanistan did in the late 1990 &quot; s , attitudes toward intervention have evolved in recent decades .
in the early 1980 &quot; s , after a particularly bloody terrorist attack on French and American forces in Lebanon , France &apos;s tolerance for military casualties seemed much higher than that of the United States .
but this has changed .
the French now find themselves on the front line at a time when they have much less appetite for it .
moreover , budget restrictions have severely constrained French military capabilities .
French and British military intervention was successful in Libya in 2011 at least in part as a result of US military procurement .
of course , from a French perspective , the US role is somewhat ironic .
in the years after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , the Americans always had to be on the front line - battling the enemy abroad to avoid having to battle him at home , in the parlance of the time - while the European allies were perceived as the cleaning staff .
but imperial fatigue after Iraq and Afghanistan has left its imprint .
Americans are starting to enjoy - probably too much for their allies - what President Barack Obama , describing the US role in Libya , called &quot; leading from behind . &quot;
for Hollande , war in Mali is both an opportunity and a risk .
if Nicolas Sarkozy , whom he defeated , was widely regarded as &quot; too &quot; presidential , Hollande has given the impression of not being presidential &quot; enough . &quot;
his fall from public grace - too statist and fiscally intrusive for the right , but too moderate and social democratic for the true left - was more rapid than that of any president of the Fifth Republic .
of course , with unemployment rising every month , it is difficult to remain popular for long .
as the supreme commander of an army at war , Hollande can now try to reinvent himself .
but , successive presidents since Jacques Chirac have failed to reconcile the French with politics .
France &apos;s citizens have tended to expect too much from their state , and now they may be expecting too little from politics and politicians at a time when deep divisions on fundamental economic and social issues run not only between the traditional right and left , but also within both camps .
will foreign intervention reunite the French ?
will war in Africa be the defining moment of Hollande &apos;s presidency ?
will he be remembered as the French Harry Truman - a discreet , uncharismatic man who , when faced with urgent and dramatic circumstances , ended up doing the right things for lack of a better alternative ?
this is a portentous moment both for Mali and for security in the Sahel and Europe .
it is no less significant for Hollande and France .
France Alone ?
Paris - In less than two years , France has carried out three decisive foreign military interventions .
in March 2011 , its airstrikes in Libya ( alongside those of Great Britain ) thwarted Colonel Muammar el @-@ Qaddafi &apos;s troops as they prepared to retake the city of Benghazi .
a month later , French forces in Côte d &apos;Ivoire arrested President Laurent Gbagbo , who had refused to recognize his rival &apos;s election victory , putting the country at risk of civil war .
now France has intervened in Mali .
the latest intervention was initially planned as part of a European mission to support African forces , but France abruptly decided to act unilaterally to blunt the advance of Islamists who threatened to overrun Mopti , the last barrier before reaching the capital , Bamako .
beyond that objective , France seeks to protect its many nationals in the region ; maintain stability in the Sahel , where states are very weak ; and prevent Mali &apos;s transformation into a base of Islamist terrorism directed at Europe .
a lot is at stake - all the more so because French intervention is likely to be extensive .
while the Islamists have been temporarily defeated , they are well armed and receive supplies from Libya via Algeria , which has suppressed Islamists at home but seems to turn a blind eye to their transit through its territory .
moreover , the capabilities of the Malian army and those of other West African countries that are supposed to join the operation are too weak to turn the tide .
the United States tried to train the Malian army , but failed miserably .
so , with the security of Europe as a whole at stake , why is France the only country involved ?
one explanation is to view the intervention as a neo @-@ colonial bid to protect a French preserve .
this is a profound error .
France has no interest in protecting a Malian regime that it knows to be corrupt and incompetent ; indeed , France recently refused to support a request from President François Bozizé &quot; s regime in the neighboring Central African Republic for aid in dealing with rebels .
France &apos;s motivations are broader .
in particular , France has always considered Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and the Arab world to be natural spheres of political and strategic influence that are necessary to maintaining its position as a global power .
the second explanation is more credible : France , aside from Great Britain , is Europe &apos;s only true military power .
it believes that operational military capability is a condition of power - a view that is not shared by the overwhelming majority of European states , which continue to display a collective aversion to war .
to be sure , Europe has the means for joint action .
in 2003 , following the start of the Iraq war , Europe embraced a strategy prepared by Javier Solana , then the European Union &apos;s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
but , while a large number of Europeans naively believed that this was the prelude to a joint European strategy , the proposal was drafted in terms that were so vague as to allow any outcome - or none .
the EU &apos;s Lisbon Treaty mentions &quot; permanent structured cooperation &quot; in security and defense policy , and an entire institutional apparatus of political and military committees exists to anticipate , prepare for , and implement military operations at the European level .
but this mechanism lacks the common political will needed to activate it ; the less it is used , the less usable it will become .
during the Libyan crisis , Solana &apos;s successor , Catherine Ashton , deliberately sought to limit the EU &apos;s role to that of a super @-@ NGO focused on humanitarian aid and economic development .
recently , during the vote on Palestinian representation at the United Nations , the EU called for its members to abstain - an odd way to affirm Europe &apos;s commitment to global leadership .
for Great Britain , Europe @-@ wide defense is a nonstarter .
Britain has deviated from this principle only once , when it agreed to participate in the Atalanta anti @-@ piracy operation off the Horn of Africa - probably because it was placed in command .
as a result , those who want a common European defense capability lack the means to create it , while those who have the means to create it do not want it ( with the possible exception of France ) .
Britain &apos;s bilateral cooperation with France - highlighted during the Libyan crisis - is sometimes very strong .
but , despite the two countries &quot; 2010 treaty on defense and security cooperation , the British have decided , for budgetary reasons , to acquire aircraft that will not be compatible with French aircraft carriers .
even Spain and Italy , the two countries most affected by developments in the Mediterranean and the Sahel , have reduced their military expenditures significantly .
unlike Germany , both participated in the Libyan intervention , but with highly limiting rules of engagement for their forces .
for example , Italian naval forces were instructed to avoid the waters off the coast of Tripoli , and Spanish tanker aircraft were forbidden to refuel fighter jets .
Europe as a whole currently devotes only 1.6 % of its GDP to defense , compared to 4.8 % for the US .
it is the only world region where military expenditures are decreasing .
its deployed forces are extremely small , accounting for 4 % of all military personnel worldwide , versus 14 % for the US .
industrial cooperation , which could constitute an economic and military asset , is also weakening , as demonstrated by Germany &apos;s successful opposition to the proposed EADS / BAE merger , which was officially canceled in October .
Germany had seemed to embark on a more robust policy since its participation in military operations in Afghanistan .
now , however , it recoils at any prospect of military intervention , even as it remains the world &apos;s third @-@ largest arms exporter .
Europe is reluctant to develop a substantial military force , because the European project was created in opposition to the idea of power .
yet this stance has become untenable .
Europe faces real threats , which France alone cannot contain .
moreover , the international system is increasingly coalescing around national powers that consider military force to be an essential prerequisite of influence .
Europe does not face a choice between soft and hard power .
it must combine both if it is to survive .
the French disconnection
Paris - Dire conditions can permit what was once unthinkable to push its way into public debate .
in France , the idea that now dares to speak its name is that the country will sink into an ever @-@ deeper economic malaise unless it regains its monetary sovereignty .
two striking statements on economic policy by France &apos;s leaders in the first weeks of this year have highlighted the force of this logic .
first , President François Hollande , worried about the euro &apos;s appreciation against other major world currencies , called for an exchange @-@ rate target .
then , Pierre Moscovici , the finance minister , said that Europe might grant France a delay in meeting the 3 % -of @-@ GDP budget @-@ deficit target mandated from this year onward under the eurozone &apos;s newly ratified fiscal compact .
these positions imply a desire to exercise sovereign power over the Economic and Monetary Union &apos;s rules and decisions .
back in 1989 @-@ 1991 , exactly the same motive underlay President François Mitterrand &apos;s imposition of the euro on Germany - that is , to harness the Bundesbank &apos;s monetary power to a framework in which France could be confident of wielding decisive influence .
since the single currency was France &apos;s condition for accepting German reunification , Germany played along .
two decades later , Germany may be in a different mood .
the sovereign @-@ debt @-@ and @-@ banking crisis that has roiled the monetary union since 2010 has steadily exposed the realities at play here , as irrevocably fixed exchange rates lock in and deepen differences in eurozone members &quot; competitiveness .
in France &apos;s case , the loss of competitiveness and resulting sharp decline in export performance has been aggravated by relying on crushing taxation of labor to finance generous welfare programs and top @-@ drawer public services ( a practice exacerbated by stifling labor @-@ market regulation ) .
in a monetary union , there are only two ways to close a competitiveness gap between countries : transfers from the more competitive to the less competitive , or internal devaluation , which means real wage cuts .
not surprisingly , the preference has been for transfers , which , until the 2008 financial crash , took the form of cross @-@ border private @-@ sector lending to governments and banks .
following the credit @-@ bubble burst in 2008 , fiscal transfers replaced these private financial flows , causing budget deficits to balloon .
and now , with the German government , as chief creditor , calling the shots on cross @-@ border transfers to weaker eurozone countries , all such transfers are conditional on austerity ( that is , internal devaluation ) .
bailouts from the European Stability Mechanism represent the clearest example of this , with the fiscal compact now committing signatories to tight deficit targets and structural adjustment .
and more austerity is a vital , if less well remarked on , condition of the European Central Bank &apos;s declared willingness to buy unlimited quantities of troubled countries &quot; short @-@ term government debt .
so far , the &quot; bazooka &quot; represented by the ECB &apos;s &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; program has had the desired effect - without having to be used .
eurozone financial markets have stabilized , and the euro has appreciated against the dollar and the yen .
but , as Hollande &apos;s recent declarations indicate , currency appreciation is the last thing that an uncompetitive country like France needs .
although the French government , unlike its Spanish and Italian counterparts , has not yet had any difficulty financing itself at low interest rates , currency appreciation as the economy slides into recession is like fuel poured onto an unlit bonfire .
unless growth is restored , France &apos;s already large public debt will expand unsustainably , heightening the risk that investors will shun French government bonds .
from this predicament stems the fashionable idea that the bond market would actually welcome less fiscal austerity , because this would boost economic growth , in turn making the level of public debt appear more sustainable in the long run .
it is no surprise that Moscovici is beginning to push for a &quot; collective European decision &quot; to relax the fiscal treaty &apos;s terms , given that French compliance would require massive new spending cuts .
will Germany agree to such a relaxation - or , for that matter , to Hollande &apos;s implicit demand that the ECB follow Japan &apos;s example and loosen monetary policy to drive the exchange rate back down ?
unlike Japan ( and , of course , the United States ) , France , as a member of a monetary union , cannot pursue domestic goals unilaterally .
to avoid disaster , France has only two options : somehow force a change in German policy or go it alone .
there are two reasons why , until now , the second option - leaving the monetary union - has been unthinkable .
the first has to do with economic and financial risks .
ditching the euro might trigger a banking crisis , capital flight , inflation , and perhaps even sovereign default .
on the other hand , higher competitiveness and erosion of the real value of debt would quickly outweigh these costs by restoring confidence in the French economy &apos;s prospects .
this strategy &apos;s success , starting with the speed of restored access to external financing , would depend on the credibility of government policies - monetary , fiscal , and , above all , the radical and indispensable supply @-@ side reforms for which there would now be breathing space .
the specter of continuing economic stagnation and ever @-@ rising unemployment ( with the young and older workers being the worst hit ) should remove the second , geopolitical obstacle to a French exit from the eurozone .
for French elites since World War II , alignment with Germany has been central to projecting French power and influence .
such ambitions must now be sacrificed for the sake of the French public &apos;s well @-@ being .
France will not regain its economic strength without setting aside the euro .
even during that adjustment , there is no reason why relations with European partners should suffer in any fundamental sense .
on the contrary , the sustainable prosperity that would result from that adjustment would create a much healthier long @-@ term foundation for continuing the quest for an &quot; ever closer union &quot; in Europe .
why France Will Sink Europe &apos;s Constitution
if public opinion polls are to be believed , on May 29 the French will reject the European Union &apos;s draft constitutional treaty .
because all EU member countries must ratify the constitution , a French &quot; Non &quot; will , in effect , kill it .
amazing as this turn of events seems , it has been long in the making .
it is amazing because France is not just a founding member of the European Community , but also has been the main driving force behind all major steps toward &quot; ever closer union . &quot;
but French opposition was also predictable because , for over a decade now , France has veered away from Europe and now finds itself increasingly isolated .
of course , Europe has also moved away from France through successive enlargements , but the main roots of the estrangement lie in France itself .
the French regard with great sadness their declining status and prestige - not only in world politics , but also in culture , science and , importantly , language .
Europe , in their view , was always a way of reclaiming world influence .
for three decades , this worked .
France and Germany had forged an alliance that called the shots in Europe .
not interested in geopolitical power - a legacy of its Nazi past - Germany was content to back France &apos;s ambitions as long as the Common Market allowed it to be Europe &apos;s economic powerhouse .
but that alliance is unraveling as Germany &apos;s own status declines , owing to its mediocre economic performance and the loss of its prestigious Deutschemark .
moreover , Germany is increasingly interested in exercising political influence on its own ; as a result , it is no longer happy with what it gets from the alliance with France .
at the same time , successive EU enlargements over the decades have brought in other powerful contenders , chiefly Spain and the UK , as well as smaller countries who are unwilling to bow before French @-@ German leadership .
in short , France has lost control of Europe .
this is not new , but it has only recently started to sink in , and it hurts .
France is also economically wounded .
here is a country that has long cherished its &quot; exception &quot; from the normal rules of market economics , a foggy view that rejects both central planning and free markets and claims to offer a well @-@ balanced middle ground .
the French do not care that they have never been able to articulate their vision of a &quot; third way , &quot; for they remain deeply convinced that the state has a key role to play in steering markets in order to defend &quot; higher &quot; values from the single @-@ minded pursuit of materialism .
this view , propagated since World War II by a quasi @-@ Marxist intelligentsia , is so ingrained that the French do not even bother to understand how markets operate .
they look upon economics as an ideological battleground , where all views can be entertained without being confronted with logic , much less with facts .
yet facts have been hitting hard .
growth has been lackluster for a quarter of a century and unemployment remains stubbornly high .
urban crime , once described as the wages of unfettered individualism , now resembles what is found in the United States , the French model &apos;s bête noire .
what has this to do with Europe ?
the EU , by design , increases economic competition , but France is ill equipped .
one after the other , most European countries have reformed their economies , shedding the cozy arrangements that used to protect every interest group from the pressure of competition .
even Germany , after even worse performance than France , has now taken decisive steps .
unable to reform their labor markets because of the fear of street protests , French governments of all political stripes seek to protect their ailing firms , only to face limits imposed by the rules of the Common Market .
the bloated French public sector , which many see as the employer of last resort , cannot afford its expensive personnel .
while many private French firms are thriving , they do so by economizing on manpower and , increasingly , by outsourcing production , often to new EU member countries where labor costs are considerably lower .
public education is in shambles and France &apos;s higher education system now faces competition from other European countries .
humbled by economic malaise and loss of influence , the French are scared .
they fear the future , because the future means either market @-@ oriented reforms or further economic and political downgrading , both of which are seen as unacceptable , if only because they clash with French self @-@ esteem .
the European Constitution has little to do with any of these challenges , but a majority of French people has started questioning the strategy that has long masked France &apos;s diminishing status .
they are alarmed by what they see as the domination of Anglo @-@ Saxon economic principles - the last nail in the coffin of France &apos;s mythical &quot; exception . &quot;
so the EU is now seen as the Trojan horse that threatens the myriad of state @-@ sanctioned benefits and handouts that every citizen enjoys .
of course , most French people would ultimately benefit from doing away with this inefficient web of big and small privileges , but most voters , depressed by poor economic prospects and unnerved by high unemployment , are simply unwilling to take the risk .
they do not understand the roots of their economic troubles and are nostalgic for better times .
they mistakenly see the European Constitution as one more challenge , at a time when they want to be nursed and protected .
scared people rarely make wise choices .
Bismarck versus Bismarck
Athens - The centrality of Germany to Europe and , more widely , to world affairs has been amply , and often bloodily , demonstrated over many centuries .
indeed , Germany &apos;s strategic position at the heart of Europe , as well as its huge economic and military potential , made it first a prize to be sought , and then , following Otto von Bismarck &apos;s completion of German unification in 1871 , a nation @-@ state to be feared .
Bismarck &apos;s legacy was a Germany that dominated European politics until the end of World War II .
that legacy is now reasserting itself .
after the interlude of the Cold War , during which Germany served as the center of discord between East and West , reunification permitted the reassertion of German power within the context of the European Union and , most notably , the eurozone .
today , however , the question is whether Germany is ready and willing to provide leadership in the conduct of the EU &apos;s affairs - and , if so , to what end .
Europe is currently facing its most challenging crisis of the postwar period .
after six quarters of recession , the slump is spreading to the eurozone &apos;s core countries .
unemployment , above 12 % on average , is at a record high .
in Spain and Greece , more than one @-@ quarter of the labor force is jobless , while the unemployment rate hovers around 60 % among young people .
despite harsh austerity , large fiscal deficits persist , and banks remain undercapitalized and unable to support a sustained economic recovery .
social malaise is deepening as expectations - and actual prospects - for economic improvement are likely to remain poor for the foreseeable future .
faith in the European project is declining , and , given the eurozone &apos;s lack of cohesion , stagnation and recession may lead to popular rejection of the EU , accompanied by serious challenges to democracy , including the rise of neo @-@ fascist parties .
and yet , despite the risks , European leaders remain remarkably inactive , apparently reassured by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s promise to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to protect the monetary union from collapse .
but prolonged inaction , induced by relative calm in financial markets , will perpetuate stagnation and eventually lead to a breakup of one sort or another .
either gradual attrition , with weaker countries defaulting , will lead to a more restricted German @-@ led club of &quot; virtuous &quot; countries , or Germany itself will choose to pursue a policy of narrow fiscal advantage by seceding from the eurozone .
the political and economic weakness of France and Italy , together with Britain &apos;s gradual withdrawal from EU affairs , highlight Germany &apos;s key role in rescuing the eurozone from the current crisis .
but true leadership requires a sense of direction and a willingness to pay up , and , here , Germany has lately been found wanting .
despite German Chancellor Angela Merkel &apos;s evident political skills and high domestic standing , her government lacks a concrete design for &quot; ever closer Union &quot; in Europe .
as a result , it , too , is in a weak position to mobilize the resources and competences required to restore Europe .
instead , Merkel &apos;s Germany has been doing as little as possible , as late as possible , to prevent the euro &apos;s collapse .
this policy cannot endure for long .
either stagnation will lead to the eurozone &apos;s breakup , or circumstances will force a policy change .
so , in which areas must Germany lead ?
first , European public debt should be partly and gradually mutualized .
national banking systems should be unified , in order to separate private losses from sovereign debt , with centralized supervision and resolution authorities , as well as a deposit @-@ insurance scheme , forming the core of a European banking union .
strong central institutions , responsible to a directly elected parliament , are needed to coordinate fiscal and economic policies .
in the shorter term , the single market should be extended to services , and free @-@ trade arrangements should be promoted either multilaterally or bilaterally with major trading partners such as the United States .
austerity should be eased , particularly in the fiscally stronger core economies , and substantial resources should be devoted to boosting youth employment and investment in small and medium @-@ size firms in the over @-@ indebted countries .
Germany &apos;s reluctance to lead on these issues partly reflects historical inhibitions , which are always difficult to overcome .
the persistence of pre @-@ Keynesian orthodoxy in German economic thought , with its moral abhorrence of the &quot; sin of borrowing &quot; ( and thus its neglect of aggregate demand ) , does not help , either .
the federalist structure of Germany &apos;s political system , moreover , favors parochial approaches over grander designs .
nonetheless , Germany must accept that the alternative to a democratically unified currency union is German economic hegemony .
in the longer run , that outcome would destroy the common European project , in turn undermining Germany &apos;s own economic prosperity and strategic security - a Bismarckian scenario from which Bismarck would have recoiled in horror .
why Germany Should Lead or Leave
new YORK - Europe has been in a financial crisis since 2007 .
when the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers endangered the credit of financial institutions , private credit was replaced by the credit of the state , revealing an unrecognized flaw in the euro .
by transferring their right to print money to the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , member countries exposed themselves to the risk of default , like Third World countries heavily indebted in a foreign currency .
commercial banks loaded with weaker countries &quot; government bonds became potentially insolvent .
there is a parallel between the ongoing euro crisis and the international banking crisis of 1982 .
back then , the International Monetary Fund saved the global banking system by lending just enough money to heavily indebted countries ; default was avoided , but at the cost of a lasting depression .
Latin America suffered a lost decade .
Germany is playing the same role today as the IMF did then .
the setting differs , but the effect is the same .
creditors are shifting the entire burden of adjustment on to the debtor countries and avoiding their own responsibility .
the euro crisis is a complex mixture of banking and sovereign @-@ debt problems , as well as divergences in economic performance that have given rise to balance @-@ of @-@ payments imbalances within the eurozone .
the authorities did not understand the complexity of the crisis , let alone see a solution .
so they tried to buy time .
usually , that works .
financial panics subside , and the authorities realize a profit on their intervention .
but not this time , because the financial problems were combined with a process of political disintegration .
when the European Union was created , it was the embodiment of an open society - a voluntary association of equal states that surrendered part of their sovereignty for the common good .
the euro crisis is now turning the EU into something fundamentally different , dividing member countries into two classes - creditors and debtors - with the creditors in charge .
as the strongest creditor country , Germany has emerged as the hegemon .
debtor countries pay substantial risk premiums for financing their government debt .
this is reflected in their cost of financing in general .
to make matters worse , the Bundesbank remains committed to an outmoded monetary doctrine rooted in Germany &apos;s traumatic experience with inflation .
as a result , it recognizes only inflation as a threat to stability , and ignores deflation , which is the real threat today .
moreover , Germany &apos;s insistence on austerity for debtor countries can easily become counterproductive by increasing the debt ratio as GDP falls .
there is a real danger that a two @-@ tier Europe will become permanent .
both human and financial resources will be attracted to the center , leaving the periphery permanently depressed . but the periphery is seething with discontent .
Europe &apos;s tragedy is not the result of an evil plot , but stems , rather , from a lack of coherent policies .
as in ancient Greek tragedies , misconceptions and a sheer lack of understanding have had unintended but fateful consequences .
Germany , as the largest creditor country , is in charge , but refuses to take on additional liabilities ; as a result , every opportunity to resolve the crisis has been missed .
the crisis spread from Greece to other deficit countries , eventually calling into question the euro &apos;s very survival .
since a breakup of the euro would cause immense damage , Germany always does the minimum necessary to hold it together .
most recently , German Chancellor Angela Merkel has backed ECB President Mario Draghi , leaving Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann isolated .
this will enable the ECB to put a lid on the borrowing costs of countries that submit to an austerity program under the supervision of the Troika ( the IMF , the ECB , and the European Commission ) .
that will save the euro , but it is also a step toward the permanent division of Europe into debtors and creditors .
the debtors are bound to reject a two @-@ tier Europe sooner or later .
if the euro breaks up in disarray , the common market and the EU will be destroyed , leaving Europe worse off than it was when the effort to unite it began , owing to a legacy of mutual mistrust and hostility .
the later the breakup , the worse the ultimate outcome .
so it is time to consider alternatives that until recently would have been inconceivable .
in my judgment , the best course of action is to persuade Germany to choose between either leading the creation of a political union with genuine burden @-@ sharing , or leaving the euro .
since all of the accumulated debt is denominated in euros , it makes all the difference who remains in charge of the monetary union.If Germany left , the euro would depreciate .
debtor countries would regain their competitiveness ; their debt would diminish in real terms ; and , with the ECB under their control , the threat of default would disappear and their borrowing costs would fall to levels comparable to that in the United Kingdom .
the creditor countries , by contrast , would incur losses on their claims and investments denominated in euros and encounter stiffer competition at home from other eurozone members .
the extent of creditor countries &quot; losses would depend on the extent of the depreciation , giving them an interest in keeping the depreciation within bounds .
after initial dislocations , the eventual outcome would fulfill John Maynard Keynes &quot; dream of an international currency system in which both creditors and debtors share responsibility for maintaining stability .
and Europe would avert the looming depression .
the same result could be achieved , with less cost to Germany , if Germany chose to behave as a benevolent hegemon .
that would mean implementing the proposed European banking union ; establishing a more or less level playing field between debtor and creditor countries by establishing a Debt Reduction Fund , and eventually converting all debt into Eurobonds ; and aiming at nominal GDP growth of up to 5 % , so that Europe could grow its way out of excessive indebtedness .
whether Germany decides to lead or leave , either alternative would be better than creating an unsustainable two @-@ tier Europe .
why Greece declined a Euro Holiday
Brussels - For the entire first half of this year , since the far @-@ left , anti @-@ austerity Syriza party came to power in January , the Greek saga virtually monopolized the attention of European policymakers .
even as their country &apos;s economy crashed , Greece &apos;s new government remained adamant in demanding debt relief without austerity - that is , until mid @-@ July , when they suddenly agreed to the creditors &quot; terms .
indeed , as of July 13 , Greece &apos;s staunchly anti @-@ austerity government has been obliged to impose even tougher austerity and pursue painful structural reforms , under its creditors &quot; close supervision .
why did the Greek government concede to terms that not only controverted its own promises , but also closely resembled those that voters had overwhelmingly rejected in a popular referendum barely a week earlier ?
many believe that Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was responding to an ultimatum from his European partners : accept our demands or leave the euro .
the question is why a Greek exit from the euro ( &quot; Grexit &quot; ) amounted to such a potent threat .
in fact , from an economic perspective , Grexit no longer represents the potential catastrophe that it once did .
after all , the main short @-@ term cost - financial @-@ system disruption - has already materialized in Greece : banks and the stock market have been shut down , and capital controls have been imposed .
while those actions were needed to stem large @-@ scale capital flight and prevent the banking system &apos;s collapse , they also caused the Greek economy to contract sharply .
in this context , Greek negotiators might have considered another proposal , circulated informally by the German finance ministry , recommending that Greece receive immediate debt forgiveness , in exchange for leaving the euro temporarily .
if Greece remained in the euro , no relief would be granted - a proviso consistent with the German position that debt restructuring for eurozone countries would be illegal .
while the legal argument is probably spurious , an outright debt reduction for a eurozone country remains politically impossible .
the German proposal , spearheaded by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble , highlights the fundamental change that has occurred in Greece &apos;s relationship with its European partners since its last bailout package three years ago .
in 2012 , Greece was offered hundreds of billions of euros in financial support , and its creditors , including Greek commercial banks , were pushed to accept substantial &quot; voluntary &quot; haircuts .
tellingly , when George Papandreou , Greece &apos;s prime minister at the time , proposed a referendum on the existing adjustment program and his country &apos;s continued eurozone membership in 2011 , he was warned off in no uncertain terms by France &apos;s then @-@ President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
though Papandreou would have campaigned for the adjustment program and the euro , a referendum was a risk that his European partners were unwilling to take .
Tsipras &apos;s government , by contrast , was able to hold its referendum , and even campaign against the creditors &quot; proposed adjustment program ( which , it should be noted , was no longer on the table ) .
even the resounding &quot; no &quot; delivered by Greek voters could not strengthen the government &apos;s negotiating position , for a simple reason : Grexit is no longer considered a threat to the euro &apos;s stability .
that is why German officials - especially Schäuble - have been encouraging Greece to leave .
one can only speculate about Schäuble &apos;s motivation in pushing for Grexit .
he seems to believe that a more integrated eurozone , though certainly desirable , is not feasible with a country that cannot be trusted to abide by the terms to which its government has agreed .
whatever Schäuble &apos;s reasons , his proposal could have represented a way out for Greece , whose economy had been squeezed dry by austerity and whose banking system was already closed .
immediate debt reduction and the recovery of economic sovereignty - even at the expense of exiting the euro , at least temporarily - would seem to have offered significant long @-@ term benefits .
in a sense , it amounted to a golden opportunity , with Germany offering to pay for something that many believe Greece should be doing anyway .
nonetheless , the Greek government rejected an exit , and instead accepted the creditors &quot; tough terms .
this suggests that , during the negotiations , Greece &apos;s leaders were driven by more than economics .
perhaps , contrary to popular belief , countries &quot; political attachment to Europe via the euro remains very strong , even where , as in Greece , people have endured unprecedented hardship since joining the monetary union .
the monetary union &apos;s rationale , as many have noted , was always more political than economic .
for precisely that reason , it may well be too early to write off the single currency .
why host the World Cup ?
NORTHAMPTON , MASSACHUSETTS - Whom would you trust more , Russian President Vladimir Putin or Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel ?
whereas Putin is reveling in the attention that Russia is receiving as host of the 2018 World Cup , Emanuel has informed the US Soccer Federation and FIFA that Chicago has no interest in serving as a host city when the event comes to North America in 2026 .
Canada and Mexico will each host ten matches , and the United States will host another 60 .
so why is the third @-@ largest US city taking a pass ?
to understand what it means to host a global sporting event , consider the fact that Putin &apos;s government spent $ 51 @-@ 70 billion to stage the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , and is projected to spend at least $ 14 billion hosting the current World Cup , which runs through July 15 .
Russia &apos;s budget provided for the construction of seven new stadiums - including one in St. Petersburg that cost around $ 1.7 billion - and renovations to five other venues . and that does not even account for the additional expenses for training facilities , lodging , expanded infrastructure , and security .
Chicago , having already hosted the opening ceremony and first match of the 1994 World Cup , has adopted quite a different mindset .
Emanuel &apos;s spokesperson , Matt McGrath , recently issued a statement explaining that , &quot; FIFA could not provide a basic level of certainty on some major unknowns that put our city and taxpayers at risk . &quot;
FIFA , McGrath alleges , was demanding something tantamount to a &quot; blank check , &quot; including an &quot; open @-@ ended ability to modify the agreement ... at any time and at their discretion . &quot;
moreover , FIFA would have required that Soldier Field - home to the Chicago Bears football team - be taken out of use for two months prior to the tournament .
in the end , Emanuel &apos;s office concluded that , &quot; The uncertainty for taxpayers , coupled with FIFA &apos;s inflexibility and unwillingness to negotiate , were clear indications that further pursuit of the bid wasn &apos;t in Chicago &apos;s best interests . &quot;
in addition to holding anywhere from two to six games - potentially over the course of a number of weeks - World Cup host cities are expected to throw a &quot; fan fest , &quot; furnish training facilities for the teams , and provide extensive tax exemptions for a range of activities .
in fact , FIFA prohibits both direct and indirect taxation on all income from the event , exempting continental soccer confederations , host @-@ country broadcasters , and FIFA member associations , service providers , and contractors .
it is little wonder , then , that Minneapolis and Vancouver have joined Chicago in declining the hosting honor .
to justify its imperious behavior , FIFA points out that , &quot; &#91; the &#93; World Cup is a major sporting event that attracts global attention to the host Country / host Countries and provides the opportunity for significant financial investment in sporting and public infrastructure . &quot;
and that added attention and investment , FIFA claims , &quot; may contribute to significant mid- and long @-@ term socioeconomic benefits ... as well as economic growth . &quot;
but note the carefully qualified language .
FIFA only goes so far as to promise an &quot; opportunity for significant financial investment &quot; in infrastructure , as well as attention and investment that &quot; may contribute &quot; to growth .
in reality , scholarly evidence shows that the World Cup rarely benefits host countries and cities as much as FIFA would like the public , and public officials , to think .
for example , consider what Russia gets in exchange for its $ 14 billion @-@ plus investment in this year &apos;s event .
while all of the revenue from ticket sales , international broadcasting rights , and sponsorships will go directly to FIFA , Russia will be left with seven new stadiums and five refurbished facilities that it does not need .
and unless it demolishes these venues , it will have to spend tens of millions of dollars every year to maintain them . meanwhile , hundreds of acres of scarce urban real estate will have been forfeited as sites for white elephants .
to be sure , images of sleek new facilities are being disseminated worldwide .
but the optics are not necessarily working in Russia &apos;s favor .
apparently , there was no hiding the 6,000 empty seats at the Uruguay @-@ Egypt match on June 15 .
if history is any guide , it is highly unlikely that the 2018 World Cup will increase Russia &apos;s international investment or trade , boost its tourism industry , or strengthen its people &apos;s commitment to physical fitness .
what it will do is instill a fleeting sense of national pride among a significant portion of Russians , while offering an ephemeral distraction from the country &apos;s mounting problems .
with or without the World Cup , oil @-@ price volatility and international sanctions imposed in response to Putin &apos;s 2014 annexation of Crimea will continue to darken Russia &apos;s economic prospects and diminish ordinary Russians &quot; standard of living .
so , whom should you trust ?
I &apos;m going with Emanuel .
why India is riskier than China
new HAVEN - Today , fears are growing that China and India are about to be the next victims of the ongoing global economic carnage .
this would have enormous consequences .
Asia &apos;s developing and newly industrialized economies grew at an 8.5 % average annual rate over 2010 @-@ 11 - nearly triple the 3 % growth elsewhere in the world .
if China and India are next to fall , Asia would be at risk , and it would be hard to avoid a global recession .
in one important sense , these concerns are understandable : both economies depend heavily on the broader global climate .
China is sensitive to downside risks to external demand - more relevant than ever since crisis @-@ torn Europe and the United States collectively accounted for 38 % of total exports in 2010 .
but India , with its large current @-@ account deficit and external funding needs , is more exposed to tough conditions in global financial markets .
yet fears of hard landings for both economies are overblown , especially regarding China .
yes , China is paying a price for aggressive economic stimulus undertaken in the depths of the subprime crisis .
the banking system funded the bulk of the additional spending , and thus is exposed to any deterioration in credit quality that may have arisen from such efforts .
there are also concerns about frothy property markets and mounting inflation .
while none of these problems should be minimized , they are unlikely to trigger a hard landing .
long fixated on stability , Chinese policymakers have been quick to take preemptive action .
that is particularly evident in Chinese officials &quot; successful campaign against inflation .
administrative measures in the agricultural sector , aimed at alleviating supply bottlenecks for pork , cooking oil , fresh vegetables , and fertilizer , have pushed food @-@ price inflation lower .
this is the main reason why the headline consumer inflation rate receded from 6.5 % in July 2011 to 4.2 % in November .
meanwhile , the People &apos;s Bank of China , which hiked benchmark one @-@ year lending rates five times in the 12 months ending this October , to 6.5 % , now has plenty of scope for monetary easing should economic conditions deteriorate .
the same is true with mandatory reserves in the banking sector , where the government has already pruned 50 basis points off the record 21.5 % required @-@ reserve ratio .
relatively small fiscal deficits - only around 2 % of GDP in 2010 - leave China with an added dimension of policy flexibility should circumstances dictate .
nor has China been passive with respect to mounting speculative excesses in residential property .
in April 2010 , it implemented tough new regulations , raising down @-@ payments from 20 % to 30 % for a first home , to 50 % for a second residence , and to 100 % for purchases of three or more units .
this strategy appears to be working .
in November , house prices declined in 49 of the 70 cities that China monitors monthly .
moreover , it is a serious exaggeration to claim , as many do today , that the Chinese economy is one massive real @-@ estate bubble .
yes , total fixed investment is approaching an unprecedented 50 % of GDP , but residential and nonresidential real estate , combined , accounts for only 15 @-@ 20 % of that - no more than 10 % of the overall economy .
in terms of floor space , residential construction accounts for half of China &apos;s real @-@ estate investment .
identifying the share of residential real estate that goes to private developers in the dozen or so first @-@ tier cities ( which account for most of the Chinese property market &apos;s fizz ) suggests that less than 1 % of GDP would be at risk in the event of a housing @-@ market collapse - not exactly a recipe for a hard landing .
as for Chinese banks , the main problem appears to be exposure to ballooning local @-@ government debt , which , according to the government , totaled $ 1.7 trillion ( roughly 30 % of GDP ) at the end of 2010 .
approximately half of this debt was on their books prior to the crisis .
some of the new debt that resulted from the stimulus could well end up being impaired , but ongoing urbanization - around 15 @-@ 20 million people per year move to cities - provides enormous support on the demand side for investment in infrastructure development and residential and commercial construction .
that tempers the risks to credit quality and , along with relatively low loan @-@ to @-@ deposit ratios of around 65 % , should cushion the Chinese banking system .
India is more problematic .
as the only economy in Asia with a current @-@ account deficit , its external funding problems can hardly be taken lightly .
like China , India &apos;s economic @-@ growth momentum is ebbing .
but unlike China , the downshift is more pronounced - GDP growth fell through the 7 % threshold in the third calendar @-@ year quarter of 2011 , and annual industrial output actually fell by 5.1 % in October .
but the real problem is that , in contrast to China , Indian authorities have far less policy leeway .
for starters , the rupee is in near free @-@ fall .
that means that the Reserve Bank of India - which has hiked its benchmark policy rate 13 times since the start of 2010 to deal with a still @-@ serious inflation problem - can ill afford to ease monetary policy .
moreover , an outsize consolidated government budget deficit of around 9 % of GDP limits India &apos;s fiscal @-@ policy discretion .
while China is in better shape than India , neither economy is likely to implode on its own .
it would take another shock to trigger a hard landing in Asia .
one obvious possibility today would be a disruptive breakup of the European Monetary Union .
in that case , both China and India , like most of the world &apos;s economies , could find themselves in serious difficulty - with an outright contraction of Chinese exports , as in late 2008 and early 2009 , and heightened external funding pressures for India .
while I remain a euro @-@ skeptic , I believe that the political will to advance European integration will prevail .
consequently , I attach a low probability to the currency union &apos;s disintegration .
barring such a worst @-@ case outcome for Europe , the odds of a hard landing in either India or China should remain low .
seduced by the political economy of false prosperity , the West has squandered its might .
driven by strategy and stability , Asia has built on its newfound strength .
but now it must reinvent itself .
Japanese @-@ like stagnation in the developed world is challenging externally dependent Asia to shift its focus to internal demand .
downside pressures currently squeezing China and India underscore that challenge .
Asia &apos;s defining moment could be hand .
why is China Booming ?
Providence , R.I. - China is now celebrating the 30th anniversary of the period officially known as &quot; reform and opening . &quot;
labeling time in this way echoes China &apos;s imperial history .
during moments of political transition - a military victory , for example - the emperor might designate a special &quot; era name &quot; to help celebrate the good news .
or the court might test out a new era name after a political debacle , in an effort to wipe the slate clean .
the last emperor of the Tang Dynasty proclaimed seven era names in fourteen years , as he sought in vain to &quot; re @-@ brand &quot; his reign and avoid his regime &apos;s demise .
Deng Xiaoping began to champion &quot; reform and opening &quot; in 1978 .
&quot; reform &quot; suggested a loosening of central controls on economic life , undertaken in a spirit of pragmatism and gradualism , as an antidote to Mao Zedong &apos;s ideology of &quot; revolution . &quot;
similarly , &quot; opening &quot; heralded the PRC &apos;s integration into the world community - especially the capitalist West .
Deng &apos;s principles still guide policy today .
one must go back to the Qing Dynasty ( 1644 @-@ 1912 ) and its 60 @-@ year era of &quot; heavenly flourishing &quot; ( Qianlong ) in the eighteenth century to find a comparable period of coherent political and economic policy .
the era of &quot; reform and opening &quot; has outlived its &quot; emperor &quot; by more than a decade , and has been the common thread running through transfers of political authority from Deng to Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao .
even the largest popular challenge the Chinese Communist Party ever faced , the demonstrations of 1989 , now looks like a blip that helped Deng consolidate support for his model of development .
if one factor undergirds China &apos;s commitment to &quot; reform and opening , &quot; it is the extraordinary macroeconomic changes of the past 30 years .
in China , people call it fazhan , or &quot; development , &quot; but in much of rest of the world , it is more commonly described simply as the &quot; China Boom , &quot; or the &quot; China Miracle . &quot;
the boom began in the countryside in the late 1970 &quot; s and 1980 &quot; s , and was followed by today &apos;s urban , industrial @-@ led growth .
indeed , there have been many smaller &quot; booms &quot; - in consumption , foreign direct investment , domestic stock markets , trade , travel , overseas study , military modernization , and international diplomacy .
there is also a boom in pollution and toxic waste , and booming interest in religion - from Buddhism to Pentecostal Christianity - and in Confucian philosophy .
little in China today speaks of moderation .
a leading fashion industry executive argues that a key engine driving the economic boom has been the influx of women into the workforce , particularly in the manufacturing zones of the south .
another compelling explanation comes from a venture capitalist who credits Chinese society with copious reserves of entrepreneurial energy that derives , he believes , from the fact that Chinese culture attaches very little shame to failing in a business enterprise .
high tolerance for failure keeps everybody striving to succeed .
whatever the cause , the boom seems an unlikely capstone to a century of war , ferment , and revolution , and only adds to the sense of discontinuity that characterizes modern China .
certainly , few observers looking in 1978 at the smoldering embers of the Cultural Revolution , or at the seeming ruination of the post @-@ 1989 years , thought China would emerge as the lightning rod of the world &apos;s developmental hopes .
paradoxically , the apparently discontinuous and contradictory nature of the &quot; era of reform and opening &quot; may actually help explain how China &apos;s boom came about .
the tumult of the Maoist period instilled in a broad cross @-@ section of people a profound appreciation for stability , and a yearning to be left alone .
Deng capitalized on this revolution @-@ weariness by diminishing the role of politics and the state in people &apos;s private lives and freeing them to release their pent @-@ up energy to pursue their own goals .
revolutionary communism may well have cleared the path for the boom in other ways as well , suggesting that the shift from socialist utopianism to capitalist pragmatism was less a U @-@ turn than a sequential process of &quot; creative destruction . &quot;
after all , Mao &apos;s Cultural Revolution against &quot; feudal society &quot; did raze much of the cultural landscape , denuding it not only of traditional values and institutions , but also of failed socialist efforts , leaving China ready for the seeds of capitalist development .
Mao &apos;s revolution fueled countless rectification movements and campaigns that inverted the once @-@ inviolate primacy of ruler over ruled , scholar over worker , husband over wife , father over son , and family over individual .
by the time of the reforms of the 1980 &quot; s and 1990 &quot; s , bonds tying individuals to culture , the state , the work unit , and household @-@ registration systems , for example , had largely unraveled .
the path had been cleared for a vast new population of atomized entrepreneurs and laborers , freed from fealty to family and Party , to storm the marketplace with newly liberated individual energy .
of course , the boom &apos;s costs should not be discounted .
environmental damage has been staggering , the gap between rich and poor has been growing , and urbanization - with all its attendant problems - has surged .
and , at least so far , the boom has not induced the systemic political changes for which many hoped .
but still , a key question remains unanswered : why did China &apos;s boom happen ?
this is one of the great questions of our time , relevant not only to China &apos;s future , but to scores of other developing countries enthralled by China &apos;s extraordinary , but still largely unexplained , success .
why is China lashing Out ?
new YORK - It must be galling for the Chinese government to keep seeing Nobel Prizes go to the wrong Chinese .
the first wrong Chinese was Gao Xingjian , a critical playwright , artist , and novelist , who received the Nobel Prize for literature in 2000 , while living in exile in Paris .
the latest is Liu Xiaobo , a literary critic and political writer , who was awarded this year &apos;s Nobel Prize for Peace while serving a prison sentence for &quot; subversion &quot; of the Communist regime .
since the Dalai Lama is not a Chinese citizen , I will leave out his Nobel Peace Prize , though to China &apos;s rulers it was perhaps the most irritating of all .
yet the Chinese government &apos;s response to Liu &apos;s Nobel Prize has been extraordinary .
instead of a show of lofty disdain , or official silence , it made a colossal fuss , protesting fiercely about plots to undermine China , and putting dozens of prominent Chinese intellectuals , including Liu &apos;s wife , Liu Xia , under house arrest .
as a result , the utterly powerless , hitherto quite obscure Liu Xiaobo , has become not only world famous , but much better known inside China , too .
combine this with China &apos;s bullying of Japan , by blocking the export of rare @-@ earth metals vital for Japanese industry , over a few uninhabited islands between Taiwan and Okinawa , and its refusal to let the renminbi appreciate , and one must wonder why China is being so heavy @-@ handed in its foreign relations .
these strong @-@ arm tactics stand out even more against the deftness of Chinese diplomacy over the last few decades .
Japan , the old wartime enemy , has been outmaneuvered repeatedly , and a soft touch made South Koreans and Southeast Asians feel relatively comfortable with China &apos;s increasing power .
but China &apos;s recent thuggish behavior is changing Asian opinions .
as the warm welcome given to Hillary Clinton on her recent swing through Asia - even in communist Vietnam - appears to show , Southeast Asians are more than happy to hang on to Pax Americana for a bit longer , out of fear of China .
other Asian countries might even be drawn closer to Japan , the only alternative to the US as a counterbalance to the Middle Kingdom .
this cannot be what China wants .
so why is China being so severe ?
one possible explanation is that China is a little drunk on its new great @-@ power status .
for the first time in almost 200 years , China can really throw its weight around , and it will do what it wants , regardless of what other countries may think .
a few decades ago , it was Japan that thought it was going to be Number One , and its businessmen , politicians , and bureaucrats were not shy about letting the rest of the world know .
call China &apos;s recent actions revenge for a century of humiliation by stronger powers .
but this may not be the best explanation for China &apos;s behavior .
in fact , the reason may be just the opposite : a sense among China &apos;s rulers of weakness at home .
at least since 1989 , the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party &apos;s monopoly on power has been fragile .
Communist ideology is a spent force .
using the People &apos;s Liberation Army to murder civilian protesters , not only in Beijing , but all over China in June 1989 , further undermined the one @-@ party system &apos;s legitimacy .
the way to regain the support of the burgeoning Chinese middle class was to promise a quick leap to greater prosperity through high @-@ speed economic growth .
the ideological vacuum left by the death of Marxist orthodoxy was filled with nationalism .
and nationalism in China , promoted through schools , mass media , and &quot; patriotic &quot; monuments and museums , means one thing : only the firm rule of the CCP will prevent foreigners , especially Westerners and the Japanese , from humiliating Chinese ever again .
this is why anyone , even a relatively unknown intellectual like Liu Xiaobo , who challenges the legitimacy of Communist Party rule by demanding multi @-@ party elections , must be crushed .
it is why the government does not dare to let the renminbi appreciate too fast , lest economic growth slow , causing the Party loses face and legitimacy .
and it is why bullying Japan is always a good option : China &apos;s rulers do not necessarily hate Japan , but they are afraid to look weak in the eyes of their citizens , who are taught from kindergarten that foreign powers want to humiliate China .
this suggests that if Liu Xiaobo and like @-@ minded dissidents ever got their wish , and democracy came to China , the problem of Chinese nationalism would not go away .
after all , if the people feel persecuted by Japan or the United States , then the people will demand chauvinistic policies .
democracy has not tempered South Korean chauvinism much , either , since the demise of the military dictatorship in the 1980 &quot; s .
but nationalism may not be a political constant .
nationalism is often fed by a sense of impotence .
when citizens feel disempowered by an authoritarian government , the next best thing is to feel empowered by national prowess .
in a multi @-@ party democracy , on the other hand , citizens are concerned with other interests , material , social , even cultural ones , and thus less likely to be drawn into aggressive chauvinism .
or so we must hope .
the state of many democracies today is not the best advertisement for political freedom . but the Chinese should have the right to decide about that themselves .
and Liu Xiaobo should be honored for saying so .
why is France Burning ?
the urban disturbances in France have been called the most severe since the riots by students and workers in 1968 .
the analogy is misleading .
while the 1968 protests challenged the French Republican model to live up to its finest aspirations , today &apos;s crisis challenges the French Revolution &apos;s model of citizenship and integration itself .
the French Republican model asserts that all French citizens have the same cultural identity .
indeed , this is the only acceptable identity .
to achieve this shared identity , all citizens have to speak the one official language and be educated according to a common curriculum .
but they also enjoy equal rights , and have the same duties , in the public arena .
all this is not only fostered by the state , but also requires the kind of uniformity that only a centralized state can impose .
indeed , the French Revolution &apos;s ideological commitment to unity was so strong that during parts of the nineteenth century , advocating federalism was a capital offense .
three components of this model incited today &apos;s crisis and make it difficult for the French Republic to address it effectively .
the first component is the classic French Republican prohibition on gathering data in the official census - or by government agencies or public or private enterprises - on ethnicity , religion , and even social class .
collecting these data would , it is argued , violate the Republican tenet that France is &quot; one and indivisible . &quot;
but the absence of a secondary breakdown of such data , like the UK @-@ style , four @-@ fold class analysis ( plus examination of patterns of unemployment by ethnicity or religion ) , makes it hard for social workers , public heath officials , and economic planners to diagnose new problems .
without the necessary data for analysis , public health policies , for example , cannot be directed toward groups that are especially disadvantaged or otherwise at risk .
the second factor is the classic French Republican rejection of , and legal norms against , any form of &quot; affirmative action , &quot; or positive discrimination , even of the most inoffensive kind .
like the prohibition of fine @-@ tuned data - without which positive discrimination is in any case impossible - affirmative action is seen as damaging to the Republican model because it is based on recognition of ethnic differences .
the third component is the post @-@ welfare state , which is now part of the French model of citizenship and guarantees all full @-@ time employees one of the highest minimum wages in the world and high employer @-@ paid benefits .
this makes it extremely difficult to let workers go , which makes employers reluctant to hire new people in the first place .
many of the social @-@ democratic countries of Europe , like Sweden , Holland , and Denmark , created similar norms in their full @-@ employment eras .
unlike France , however , they also used census data to identify pockets of new unemployment , and to invest socially and politically , not only in excellent job @-@ training programs , but in job creation , and , just as importantly , in job @-@ placement schemes .
France is now very bad at creating new jobs .
it has few training programs , but high benefits for the unemployed and strong restrictions against firing workers .
put all of this together , and it is like slamming a door in the face of young minority men looking for work .
this is the primary cause of the 30 @-@ 50 % unemployment rates among minorities aged 16 @-@ 24 in many French &quot; urban zones of sensitivity . &quot;
thus , the riots that France is now seeing emerge from French policies , not from instigations by Islamists .
France has simply failed to incorporate minority citizens - many of them third @-@ generation immigrants who have been educated for twenty years in assimilationist public schools .
but few political leaders accept that the crisis has anything to do with the French model of citizenship .
indeed , they confidently wait for assimilation to kick in .
but in today &apos;s high unemployment , low job @-@ creation , and now multicultural France , assimilation will not occur without big changes .
France is only now beginning to come to grips with the crisis of its Republican model of equal citizenship .
a newly created Minister of Social Cohesion has begun to commission studies documenting discrimination .
one study showed that for similarly qualified job applicants , those with an Islamic @-@ sounding name , and an address in an ethnically segmented suburb , had only one @-@ fifth the chance of even getting an interview as people with a French @-@ sounding name and a &quot; safe &quot; address .
two hundred and fifty of the largest private and public enterprises have created an organization aimed at working with the government to allow them , for the first time ever , to document , and then redress , their discriminatory employment practices .
fortunately , organized Muslim leaders so far have not aggravated the rioting .
of course , the government &apos;s reduction of community policing in favor of paramilitary forces stationed in quasi @-@ military barracks , and the Minister of Interior &apos;s description of the young rioters as &quot; scum &quot; who should be washed away with an industrial power hose , has not helped .
the French Republican model enshrines the laudable abstract principles of liberty , equality , and fraternity .
however , so long as second- and third @-@ generation minority citizens are taught that the only acceptable cultural identity is French , but are not in fact accepted as French - indeed , are blocked from enjoying the full rights of French citizenship - the Republican model will fuel alienation rather than democratic integration .
why ISIS persists
new YORK - Deadly terrorist attacks in Istanbul , Dhaka , and Baghdad demonstrate the murderous reach of the Islamic State ( ISIS ) in Europe , North Africa , the Middle East , and parts of Asia .
the longer ISIS maintains its strongholds in Syria and Iraq , the longer its terrorist network will create such carnage .
yet ISIS is not especially difficult to defeat .
the problem is that none of the states involved in Iraq and Syria , including the United States and its allies , has so far treated ISIS as its primary foe .
it &apos;s time they do .
ISIS has a small fighting force , which the US puts at 20,000 to 25,000 in Iraq and Syria , and another 5,000 or so in Libya .
compared to the number of active military personnel in Syria ( 125,000 ) , Iraq ( 271,500 ) , Saudi Arabia ( 233,500 ) , Turkey ( 510,600 ) , or Iran ( 523,000 ) , ISIS is minuscule .
despite US President Barack Obama &apos;s pledge in September 2014 to &quot; degrade and ultimately destroy &quot; ISIS , the US and its allies , including Saudi Arabia , Turkey , and Israel ( behind the scenes ) , have been focusing instead on toppling Syria &apos;s Bashar al @-@ Assad .
consider a recent candid statement by Israeli Major General Herzi Halevy ( quoted to me by a journalist who attended the speech where Halevy made it ) : &quot; Israel does not want to see the situation in Syria end with &#91; ISIS &#93; defeated , the superpowers gone from the region , and &#91; Israel &#93; left with a Hezbollah and Iran that have greater capabilities . &quot;
Israel opposes ISIS , but Israel &apos;s greater concern is Assad &apos;s Iranian backing .
Assad enables Iran to support two paramilitary foes of Israel , Hezbollah and Hamas .
Israel therefore prioritizes the removal of Assad over the defeat of ISIS .
for the US , steered by neoconservatives , the war in Syria is a continuation of the plan for global US hegemony launched by Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Under Secretary Paul Wolfowitz at the Cold War &apos;s end .
in 1991 , Wolfowitz told US General Wesley Clark :
&quot; but one thing we did learn &#91; from the Persian Gulf War &#93; is that we can use our military in the region - in the Middle East - and the Soviets won &apos;t stop us .
and we &apos;ve got about 5 or 10 years to clean up those old Soviet regimes - Syria , Iran ( sic ) , Iraq - before the next great superpower comes on to challenge us . &quot;
the multiple US wars in the Middle East - Afghanistan , Iraq , Syria , Libya , and others - have sought to remove the Soviet Union , and then Russia , from the scene and to give the US hegemonic sway .
these efforts have failed miserably .
for Saudi Arabia , as for Israel , the main goal is to oust Assad in order to weaken Iran .
Syria is part of the extensive proxy war between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia that plays out in the battlefields of Syria and Yemen and in bitter Shia @-@ Sunni confrontations in Bahrain and other divided countries in the region ( including Saudi Arabia itself ) .
for Turkey , the overthrow of Assad would bolster its regional standing .
yet Turkey now faces three foes on its southern border : Assad , ISIS , and nationalist Kurds .
ISIS has so far taken a back seat to Turkey &apos;s concerns about Assad and the Kurds .
but ISIS @-@ directed terrorist attacks in Turkey may be changing that .
Russia and Iran , too , have pursued their own regional interests , including through proxy wars and support for paramilitary operations .
yet both have signaled their readiness to cooperate with the US to defeat ISIS , and perhaps to solve other problems as well .
the US has so far spurned these offers , because of its focus on toppling Assad .
the US foreign @-@ policy establishment blames Russian President Vladimir Putin for defending Assad , while Russia blames the US for trying to overthrow him .
these complaints might seem symmetrical , but they &apos;re not .
the attempt by the US and its allies to overthrow Assad violates the UN Charter , while Russia &apos;s support of Assad is consistent with Syria &apos;s right of self @-@ defense under that charter .
yes , Assad is a despot , but the UN Charter does not give license to any country to choose which despots to depose .
the persistence of ISIS underscores three strategic flaws in US foreign policy , along with a fatal tactical flaw .
first , the neocon quest for US hegemony through regime change is not only bloody @-@ minded arrogance ; it is classic imperial overreach .
it has failed everywhere the US has tried it .
Syria and Libya are the latest examples .
second , the CIA has long armed and trained Sunni jihadists through covert operations funded by Saudi Arabia .
in turn , these jihadists gave birth to ISIS , which is a direct , if unanticipated , consequence of the policies pursued by the CIA and its Saudi partners .
third , the US perception of Iran and Russia as implacable foes of America is in many ways outdated and a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy .
a rapprochement with both countries is possible .
fourth , on the tactical side , the US attempt to fight a two @-@ front war against both Assad and ISIS has failed .
whenever Assad has been weakened , Sunni jihadists , including ISIS and al @-@ Nusra Front , have filled the vacuum .
Assad and his Iraqi counterparts can defeat ISIS if the US , Russia , Saudi Arabia , and Iran provide air cover and logistical support .
yes , Assad would remain in power ; yes , Russia would retain an ally in Syria ; and yes , Iran would have influence there .
terrorist attacks would no doubt continue , perhaps even in the name of ISIS for a while ; but the group would be denied its base of operations in Syria and Iraq .
such an outcome would not only end ISIS on the ground in the Middle East ; it could lay the groundwork for reducing regional tensions more generally .
the US and Russia could begin to reverse their recent new cold war through shared efforts to stamp out jihadist terrorism .
( a pledge that NATO will not offer admission to Ukraine or escalate missile defenses in Eastern Europe would also help . )
there &apos;s more .
a cooperative approach to defeating ISIS would give Saudi Arabia and Turkey reason and opportunity to find a new modus vivendi with Iran .
Israel &apos;s security could be enhanced by bringing Iran into a cooperative economic and geopolitical relationship with the West , in turn enhancing the chances for a long @-@ overdue two @-@ state settlement with Palestine .
the rise of ISIS is a symptom of the shortcomings of current Western - particularly US - strategy .
the West can defeat ISIS .
the question is whether the US will undertake the strategic reassessment needed to accomplish that end .
why Is Physics Beautiful ?
Cambridge - The nineteenth @-@ century physicist Heinrich Hertz once described his feeling that James Clerk Maxwell &apos;s equations , which depict the fundamentals of electricity and magnetism , &quot; have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own , that they are wiser ... even than their discoverers , that we get more out of them than was originally put into them . &quot;
not long after , Albert Einstein called Niels Bohr &apos;s atomic model &quot; the highest form of musicality in the sphere of thought . &quot;
more recently , the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman , describing his discovery of new laws of physics , declared , &quot; You can recognize truth by its beauty and simplicity . &quot;
similar sentiments are all but universal among modern physicists .
wishful thinking could never produce working iPhones , photographs of Pluto , or atomic bombs .
physics , as summarized in a handful of mathematically precise laws , indisputably works .
yet many things that &quot; work &quot; do not inspire the kind of admiration that the fundamental laws of nature do .
their beauty is rooted , first , in the laws &quot; symmetry , here meaning the possibility of change without change - a precise yet almost mystical concept .
just as a circle can be rotated about its center at any angle , changing the position of each of its points without changing its form , symmetric laws apply to changed situations without changing or losing validity .
for example , special relativity asserts that the fundamental laws of physics remain the same when we view the world from a platform moving at constant velocity .
similarly , so @-@ called time translation symmetry encodes the uniformity of physical law in time : even as the universe ages , the laws remain the same .
the second source of beauty in the laws of physics is their productivity - what I call their exuberance .
just a handful of basic principles generates an astonishing wealth of consequences - everything in the physical world !
you can write the equations of the core theories of physics - known as the standard model - quite comfortably on a T @-@ shirt .
to paraphrase Hertz , they give back far more than we put in .
it is important to note that the laws of physics need not necessarily have such marvelous properties .
consider this hypothetical situation : developments in computer power , virtual reality , and artificial intelligence enable the creation of self @-@ aware beings whose &quot; world &quot; is , from our perspective , a programmed simulation .
if a self @-@ aware Super Mario began to analyze the laws of his world , he would find very little symmetry or productivity .
instead , he would find a vast collection of loosely connected , quirky rules , reflecting the whims of the programmer .
the beauty of physical law is too impressive to be accidental .
it has led people throughout history to believe that some tasteful higher being created us , and that we inhabit a consciously designed world , like our notional Super Mario .
but this is an extravagant hypothesis , which goes far beyond the facts it is meant to explain .
before adopting it , we should explore more economical alternatives .
the answer likely lies within us .
beautiful things are those in which we find pleasure and seek out .
they are , in neurobiological terms , things that stimulate our reward system .
that explains why parents tend to find their young children beautiful , and adults are attracted to nubile models and their images .
it makes evolutionary sense to reward such feelings .
the evolutionary utility of the beauty of physical laws is somewhat less obvious , but no less real .
given the usefulness of accurately assessing the consequences of our actions , our reward system has evolved so that we derive joy from making successful predictions .
understanding the forces and patterns defining our world , and especially principles that apply ( without changing ) to a wide variety of situations , can help to improve our predictions .
the fact that we can often infer the behavior of complex objects or systems from knowledge of their parts - that we get back more than we put in - can help us to hone our predictions further .
in short , because evolution predisposes us to find beautiful those things that help us understand the world correctly , it is no accident that we find the correct laws of nature beautiful .
viewed from this perspective , the apparent beauty of the laws of physics - our attraction to their symmetry and exuberance - is not surprising .
what remains mysterious is why they are comprehensible .
a profound link between beauty and comprehensibility is an increasingly important source of scientific progress .
today &apos;s frontiers of fundamental physics are far removed from everyday experience .
they are difficult and expensive to access experimentally , and we cannot rely on our intuition to fill in the blanks .
the patient accumulation of fact recommended by Francis Bacon , Isaac Newton , and Sherlock Holmes is thus no longer practical .
instead , we reverse the process , using guesswork to motivate experiment .
we first construct beautiful equations , then derive their consequences , and , finally , craft experiments to test them .
in recent decades , that strategy has proved remarkably successful .
it has given us quantum chromodynamics , which resolves the central problem of nuclear physics , as well as predicting the Higgs particle and much else .
rather than recognizing the beauty of laws otherwise discovered , we use principles of beauty - vast symmetry and a high ratio of output to input - to enable discovery .
when this works , we have an &quot; anthropic &quot; explanation of the laws &quot; beauty : if they were not beautiful , we would not have found them .
why is the US Presidential Race So Close ?
Washington , DC - Many people around the world are probably wondering why Hillary Clinton - who is obviously more prepared and better suited for the American presidency than her opponent , Donald Trump - isn &apos;t waltzing to victory .
many Americans share the world &apos;s bewilderment .
national opinion polls may well continue to fluctuate until the election on November 8 .
but Trump has been closing in on Clinton in recent weeks , even threatening to catch up with her in the Electoral College vote , where the Democrats &quot; control of some of the most populous states ( New York and California ) give Clinton an advantage .
why is this happening ?
for starters , Trump , despite knowing almost nothing about governance or public policy , has managed to consolidate most Republicans behind him .
one motivation is Republicans &quot; long @-@ held hatred of Clinton .
another is the Supreme Court ; the court already has one vacant seat for the next president to fill and is likely to have more over the next four years .
Trump has also exploited many Americans &quot; economic anxieties , tapping the same anti @-@ immigrant , anti @-@ elite rage that is sweeping across European countries .
but Trump cannot win by appealing only to white men without a college degree .
so he has been clumsily trying to suggest that he also cares about African Americans and Latinos - not by talking to African @-@ American and Latino voters , but by speaking in exaggerated stereotypes about them to white audiences .
not surprisingly , African @-@ Americans and Latinos consider his comments insensitive and patronizing ; white women - his real target audience - haven &apos;t yet been persuaded , either .
meanwhile , Clinton is having her own difficulties reconstructing President Barack Obama &apos;s coalition of women , African Americans , Latinos , and millennials .
many young people who passionately supported Clinton &apos;s Democratic primary opponent , Senator Bernie Sanders , have ignored Sanders &apos;s own admonitions to support Clinton , and are saying that they &apos;ll vote for third @-@ party candidates , which would help Trump .
since the two major parties &quot; national conventions in July , each candidate has alternately made gains and suffered losses .
this month , just as Trump was rising in the polls , he attempted to separate himself from the racist &quot; birther &quot; movement , which falsely claims that Obama - America &apos;s first black president - wasn &apos;t born in the United States , and thus was ineligible for the presidency .
Trump &apos;s remarks , terse and grudging , reminded everyone that he himself was one of the loudest &quot; birthers &quot; of all .
his damage @-@ control effort further backfired , because he falsely claimed that Clinton and her 2008 presidential campaign had started the birther rumor .
many news outlets finally used the word &quot; lie &quot; in their coverage of Trump , who had gone essentially unchallenged on past fabrications .
Trump &apos;s recent polling gains say less about his improvement as a candidate than they do about Clinton &apos;s own weaknesses and bad luck .
outside her base of passionate loyalists , Clinton has always had a voter @-@ enthusiasm problem .
she comes across to many as a packaged know @-@ it @-@ all , the super @-@ smart girl who put off the boys in school .
and she confronts a fair amount of sexism , even among her supporters .
( a former Democratic governor recently declared that she should smile more .
would he have said that about a man ? )
but Clinton has also created some of her own problems .
her poor judgment in using a private email server as Secretary of State , thereby risking the disclosure of classified material , has become a chronic burden for her campaign .
she compounded the problem when she claimed , falsely , that her predecessors had done the same thing , and that State Department security officials had cleared it .
and , unlike Trump , she received no deference from the press on this issue .
the email saga added to voters &quot; long @-@ held impression that Clinton isn &apos;t &quot; honest and trustworthy , &quot; and it exposed her to attacks from adversaries on the right .
the highly conservative advocacy group Judicial Watch has continually called attention to the issue , forcing the disclosure of emails that Clinton hadn &apos;t turned over to the State Department .
( the FBI found nearly 15,000 emails on Clinton &apos;s server that she hadn &apos;t provided . )
numerous as @-@ yet @-@ undisclosed emails with the potential to damage Clinton may well be released before the election .
while FBI Director James Comey decided not to recommend prosecution of Clinton for the email issue , he hurt her campaign by commenting that she &apos;d been &quot; extremely careless . &quot;
in any case , the choice not to prosecute had Republicans and conservative commentators howling that she &apos;d received preferential treatment from the Democratic administration .
polls showed that 56 % of respondents agreed that Clinton should have been prosecuted .
a new issue for Clinton arose in August , when the Associated Press reported that numerous donors to the Clinton Foundation had received special treatment by the State Department during Clinton &apos;s tenure there , mainly by winning an appointment with her .
but many of these people would have received an appointment anyway ; and there is no evidence that State Department policies were changed as a result .
meanwhile , the Washington Post has begun to report on questionable - possibly illegal - expenditures by Trump &apos;s own charitable foundation .
Trump , who hadn &apos;t donated to his foundation since 2008 , subsequently used its funds to buy personal items ( including a six @-@ foot portrait of himself ) and to pay legal settlements .
previously , it had also been disclosed that funds from the Trump Foundation had been used to contribute to the election campaigns of attorneys @-@ general in Florida and Texas , which would also be illegal .
finally , Clinton had the bad luck of falling ill , with cellphone video showing her nearly collapsing as she left early a ceremony in New York City commemorating the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attack .
this added further fuel to right @-@ wing media speculation that she is in poor health ; Trump added the sexist charge that she lacks the &quot; stamina &quot; to be president .
the press covering Clinton were furious to learn that twodays earlier she had been diagnosed with pneumonia and had kept it to herself .
but American presidential elections are brutal marathons , and it &apos;s understandable that she did not want to cancel planned events .
a later poll showed that the majority of the public agreed .
Clinton &apos;s four @-@ day convalescence came just as she was preparing to make the case for why people should vote for her , rather than why they shouldn &apos;t vote for Trump .
just as she resumed campaigning , there were bombings in New York and New Jersey , and two more police shootings of unarmed African Americans , which spurred demonstrations in North Carolina , a swing state .
the events took over the national dialogue , with Trump , as usual , playing on racial divisions and blaming Obama and Clinton .
this is the background against which the candidates will head into face @-@ to @-@ face debates , which tend to play a large ( even excessive ) role in shaping US elections .
it would be unwise to call this election over before it is .
pulling the OMT Trigger
Chicago - Europe has been experiencing a period of calm after the storm since European Central Bank President Mario Draghi &apos;s &quot; whatever it takes &quot; speech in July and the ECB &apos;s decision in September to proceed with its &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) program to purchase distressed eurozone members &quot; government bonds .
the interest @-@ rate spreads for Italian and Spanish government bonds have dropped dramatically , corporate @-@ bond issues have resumed , and a sense of normalcy is slowly pervading the continent .
but it would be foolish to conclude that the euro &apos;s problems have been solved .
the economic fundamentals are far from stable , while the reduced financial tension is the fortunate outcome of an expectation game .
as long as investors believe that Italy and Spain will eventually be rescued by the OMT , these countries &quot; borrowing costs will be low , and the rescue will not be needed .
if , however , the slightest doubt about the OMT &apos;s effectiveness arises , the expectation game will shift into reverse , and both countries &quot; bonds will quickly come under attack .
one such source of doubt may be the OMT &apos;s safety catch .
to become operational , all European governments must approve it .
the rules vary among EU countries , but , in Germany , &quot; government approval &quot; implies parliamentary approval .
in an emergency situation , it is difficult to imagine that Germany will not prefer approval to the disaster of an Italian or Spanish default .
still , any delay could be enough to trigger a bank run in either country .
by the time the German Bundestag decided , it could be too late .
to eliminate this uncertainty , Italy and Spain should ask for the OMT intervention before it is desperately needed - a request that the Bundestag would most likely approve , viewing it as an insurance scheme rather than a pure transfer .
doing so would also eliminate the uncertainty surrounding the program itself and its implementation mechanisms .
identifying and addressing problems when intervention is not urgently needed is much easier than working them out under the threat of a pending sovereign default .
finally , an early request for OMT intervention would not only reduce the Italian and Spanish governments &quot; borrowing costs ( and thus their fiscal deficits ) , but would also lower the cost of capital for local firms , which currently find it difficult to borrow and invest .
thus , it would provide a much @-@ needed boost to these countries &quot; struggling economies .
so , if triggering OMT intervention would be so beneficial , why are the Spanish and Italian governments so reluctant to do so ?
the main reason is political .
in the 1930 &quot; s , all European governments feared that breaking from the gold standard would be perceived as a sign of weakness .
as a result , they waited too long .
the same is true of the OMT program : elected politicians fear that triggering it would be perceived as a sign of weakness , implying a cost that they have a strong incentive to delay paying .
but why is Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti , who is not an elected politician ( and has promised not to run for election ) , so hesitant ?
given that he does not have to fear electoral defeat , he could help Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy by filing first , which would weaken the political stigma for Rajoy &apos;s government were it to file subsequently .
triggering OMT now would also be a safe play for Italy in the face of an imminent general election with a highly uncertain outcome .
what is not uncertain is that an anti @-@ euro party , run by a professional comedian , Beppe Grillo , will gain at least 20 % of the Italian vote .
the political instability that could ensue would not provide a good opportunity to ask Germany for help .
in fact , if one were to imagine reasons why Germany might not approve a request by Italy to trigger the OMT , political turmoil would top the list .
by contrast , triggering the OMT in advance would promote political stability in the face of uncertainty , because it would tie the hands of any future Italian government .
why , then , is Monti not acting ?
one possible reason is personal pride .
Monti wants to be remembered as the prime minister who saved Italy from disaster .
he does not want to go down in history as the prime minister who had to surrender Italy &apos;s sovereignty to save the country from default .
an alternative explanation is that Monti does indeed have political ambitions .
while Monti &apos;s mandate was set to last until the election , he might be trying to extend it with the support of the new parliament .
delay for either of these reasons would be a very selfish act .
Monti should not risk European stability for his personal benefit .
he should trigger OMT before it is too late .
Italy &apos;s French Temptation
Florence - Italy is once again being gulled by the false hope that if it can just &quot; fix &quot; its institutions , its politics will normalize .
this time , it is the French model that is enticing Italy &apos;s leaders .
since February &apos;s inconclusive general election , Italian lawmakers have managed to agree on only one thing : the reelection of 88 @-@ year @-@ old President Giorgio Napolitano , which makes him the first two @-@ term president since Italy abolished the monarchy in 1946 .
the main center @-@ left and center @-@ right parties that supported Napolitano - despite the protests of Beppe Grillo and his anti @-@ establishment Five Star Movement , which won a quarter of the parliamentary vote - hope that he can oversee the creation of a broad @-@ based coalition government .
but addressing Italy &apos;s myriad institutional weaknesses - which have led to ungovernability , endemic fragmentation , disfattismo ( defeatism ) , and widespread public frustration with the establishment - will require an overhaul of the country &apos;s political system .
given that France overcame similar weaknesses and political deadlock with the creation of the Fifth Republic , which includes a robust executive led by a powerful president , the French model seems like an effective one to follow .
indeed , at first glance , pursuing such a change in Italy appears simple .
perhaps it is not surprising that Italians admire France &apos;s Fifth Republic .
after all , its governments - unlike those in Italy - have been remarkably stable and relatively durable , lasting 643 days , on average .
moreover , no one party or figure has dominated French politics for too long , with power alternating regularly between parties of the left and the right , at least since François Mitterrand &apos;s first victory in 1981 .
but , for many Italians , the French political system &apos;s most attractive feature is that the president is the true head of the executive - and , since the presidential and legislative terms were aligned in 2000 , that authority has run for five years at a time .
to Italian lawmakers , mired in stalemate and indecision , the French executive &apos;s considerable influence over the parliament is appealing .
that influence is bolstered by the electoral rules &quot; inherent bias in favor of powerful parties .
indeed , no electoral system creates a greater vote @-@ seat distortion than France &apos;s two @-@ round majoritarian system .
for example , in 2012 , the Socialists obtained nearly 50 % of the seats in the National Assembly , despite having won only 29 % of the vote in the first round .
the right @-@ wing RPR @-@ UDF coalition did even better in 1993 , when it won 38.5 % of the vote in the first round but obtained an astonishing 82 % of the seats .
in France , smaller parties can gain parliamentary seats only if they manage to negotiate a pre @-@ election agreement with one of the major parties to secure for them some constituencies .
one could argue that this system facilitates more efficient governance , and thus could potentially save Italy from its debilitating gridlock .
but it is difficult to see how it is good for democracy .
before becoming overly enamored of French institutions , Italians should consider what the French think of their own system .
in fact , the French are extremely frustrated with their country &apos;s politics , particularly with their presidents .
this dissatisfaction does not reflect a failure of François Hollande , whose approval rating stands at only 26 % one year into his presidential term ; his two immediate predecessors , Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy , also left office in disgrace .
according to Eurobarometer data collected over the last two decades , Italy &apos;s political system , its leaders , and its democratic institutions have the lowest level of citizen satisfaction among the first 15 European Union countries .
but France is a close second .
likewise , France is second only to Italy when it comes to the desire to reform and restructure its political institutions .
at the end of the day , there is no institutional reform that could miraculously &quot; save &quot; Italy .
while a semi @-@ presidential system like France &apos;s could enable Italy to suppress symmetric bicameralism and reform the worst aspects of its electoral law ( known as porcellum , or &quot; the crap law &quot; ) , thereby improving governability , it would create as many problems as it would solve .
French history demonstrates that excessive presidential power is likely to create an almighty and , at times , politically feckless executive , alongside a weak parliament that chronically under @-@ represents a significant proportion of the population .
beyond the incantatory formulas , Italians should reflect carefully on the desirability of adopting such a system .
why Marx Was Wrong
Stockholm - The bicentennial of Karl Marx &apos;s birth has occasioned a surge of interest in the man &apos;s work , complete with the unveiling of a statue in his hometown of Trier , Germany .
at a celebration of Marxism in Beijing last week , Chinese President Xi Jinping declared that , &quot; like a spectacular sunrise , the theory illuminated the path of humanity &apos;s exploration of the law of history , and humanity &apos;s search for &#91; its &#93; own liberation . &quot;
he would go on to claim that Marx &quot; pointed out the direction , with scientific theory , toward an ideal society with no oppression or exploitation , where every person would enjoy equality and freedom . &quot;
given that Xi &apos;s words were uttered in &quot; Marxist &quot; China , those in attendance had no choice but to agree with them .
yet , speaking in Trier on the same day , European Commission President Jean @-@ Claude Juncker offered a somewhat generous appraisal of his own : &quot; today he stands for things which is he not responsible for and which he didn &apos;t cause , because many of the things he wrote down were redrafted into the opposite . &quot;
it is not entirely clear what Juncker meant by this .
Marxism , after all , has inflicted untold misery on tens of millions of people who have been forced to live under regimes waving its banner .
for much of the twentieth century , 40 % of humanity suffered famines , gulags , censorship , and other forms of repression at the hands of self @-@ proclaimed Marxists .
in his speech , Juncker seemed to be alluding to the standard counterargument : that communist atrocities throughout the twentieth century were due to some sort of distortion of Marx &apos;s thought , for which the man himself can scarcely be held responsible .
is there anything to this argument ?
Marx spent most of his life analyzing the political economy of the industrializing mid @-@ nineteenth @-@ century West .
but his enduring relevance owes more to his ideas for the future , and the implications they would have for society .
in considering his legacy , this area of his thought cannot be ignored .
Marx regarded private property as the source of all evil in the emerging capitalist societies of his day .
accordingly , he believed that only by abolishing it could society &apos;s class divisions be healed , and a harmonious future ensured .
under communism , his collaborator Friedrich Engels later claimed , the state itself would become unnecessary and &quot; wither away . &quot;
these assertions were not made as speculation , but rather as scientific claims about what the future held in store .
but , of course , it was all rubbish , and Marx &apos;s theory of history - dialectical materialism - has since been proved wrong and dangerous in practically every respect .
the great twentieth @-@ century philosopher Karl Popper , one of Marx &apos;s strongest critics , rightly called him a &quot; false prophet . &quot;
and , if more evidence were needed , the countries that embraced capitalism in the twentieth century went on to become democratic , open , and prosperous societies .
by contrast , every regime that has rejected capitalism in the name of Marxism has failed - and not by coincidence or as a result of some unfortunate doctrinal misunderstanding on the part of Marx &apos;s followers .
by abolishing private ownership and establishing state control of the economy , one not only deprives society of the entrepreneurship needed to propel it forward ; one also abolishes freedom itself .
because Marxism treats all contradictions in society as the products of a class struggle that will disappear when private property does , dissent after the establishment of communism is impossible .
by definition , any challenge to the new order must be an illegitimate remnant of the oppressive order that came before .
thus , Marxist regimes have in fact been logical extensions of his doctrines .
of course Juncker is right that Marx - who died 34 years before the Russian Revolution - was not responsible for the Gulag , and yet his ideas clearly were .
in his landmark three @-@ volume study Main currents of Marxism , the Polish philosopher Leszek Kołakowski , who became a leading critic of Marxism after having embraced it in his youth , notes that Marx showed almost no interest in people as they actually exist .
&quot; Marxism takes little or no account of the fact that people are born and die , that they are men and women , young or old , healthy or sick , &quot; he writes .
as such , &quot; Evil and suffering , in his eyes , had no meaning except as instruments of liberation ; they were purely social facts , not an essential part of the human condition . &quot;
Kołakowski &apos;s insight helps to explain why regimes that have embraced Marx &apos;s mechanical and deterministic doctrine inevitably must turn to totalitarianism when confronting the reality of a complex society .
they have not always fully succeeded ; but the results have always been tragic .
for his part , Xi views China &apos;s economic development over the past few decades as &quot; cast iron proof &quot; of Marxism &apos;s continued validity .
but , if anything , it is exactly the other way around .
remember that it was the China of pure communism that produced the famine and terror of the &quot; Great Leap Forward &quot; and the &quot; Cultural Revolution . &quot;
Mao &apos;s decision to deprive farmers of their land and entrepreneurs of their firms had predictably disastrous results , and the Communist Party of China has since abandoned that doctrinaire approach .
under Mao &apos;s successor , Deng Xiaoping , the CPC launched China &apos;s great economic &quot; opening @-@ up . &quot;
after 1978 , it began to restore private ownership and permit entrepreneurship , and the results have been nothing short of spectacular .
if China &apos;s development is being held back by anything today , it is the remnants of Marxism that are still visible in inefficient state @-@ owned enterprises and the repression of dissent .
China &apos;s centralized single @-@ party system is simply incompatible with a modern and diverse society .
two hundred years after Marx &apos;s birth , it is certainly wise to reflect on his intellectual legacy .
we should do so not in celebration , however , but to inoculate our open societies against the totalitarian temptation that lurks in his false theories .
why Mexico is Sick
Mexico City - As I reflect on my troubled country , the lyrics of a Bruce Springsteen song come to mind : &quot; we are far , far away from home . our home is far , far away from us . &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels to live in Mexico nowadays : far from democratic normalcy ; far from a health system that inspires confidence ; far from a government that builds trust ; far from home and close to everything that imperils it .
my homeland has become a place where too many people are victims , succumbing to a virus , or gunned down by a drug @-@ trafficker ; assaulted by a robber , shot by an ill @-@ trained policeman , or kidnapped by a member of a criminal gang .
the flu epidemic , which probably began in the southern state of Veracruz , is yet another sign that all is not well in Mexico .
the country seems to be caught in a permanent , uneasy tug @-@ of @-@ war between the past and the future , between change and the actors who seek to place obstacles in its path .
for example , when initial reports surfaced about the first swine flu cases , it took three weeks for the information to reach federal health authorities , because state governments were reluctant to report cases quickly due to political and electoral considerations .
Mexico faces mid @-@ term elections for Congress in the fall , and President Felipe Calderón &apos;s National Action Party is trailing slightly in the polls over its main rivals , who would like nothing better than to see a health emergency translate into a political defeat .
in the face of a public health system that seemed incapable of diagnosing and treating the outbreak quickly , the government felt it had little choice but to shut down Mexico City , dealing a severe blow to an already crippled economy .
in contrast with Mexico &apos;s authoritarian past , when an &quot; imperial presidency &quot; constituted a major obstacle to modernization , power has been dispersed .
what the executive branch has relinquished , or been forced to give up , vested interests have seized .
the problem is no longer too much power in the president &apos;s hands , but too much power in the hands of &quot; veto centers &quot; - including public @-@ sector unions - that are blocking much @-@ needed reforms , including in the health system .
in all likelihood , the 22 reported dead from swine flu reflect a social safety net falling to pieces due to lack of public investment and union recalcitrance .
the flu also revealed some of Mexico &apos;s other fundamental flaws .
the political system has become a peculiar hybrid of authoritarian remnants and newly established mechanisms for transparency .
the electoral process has been unable to guarantee decent democratic governance , rein in predatory practices among the political class , or make public officials follow established rules , keep them responsive to citizen preferences , and deter them from channeling public funds into private hands .
lack of accountability has both encouraged corruption and fed perceptions that abuse remains unpunished . impunity , in turn , erodes the credibility of the country &apos;s institutions , including public hospitals and clinics .
today , conspiracy theories abound in Mexico about the origins of the virus , because government officials are viewed with such ingrained suspicion .
throughout the epidemic , citizens have largely obeyed government guidelines and followed public health prescriptions . but that doesn &apos;t mean they trust the government .
public @-@ opinion polls reveal that more than 50 % of the population believe that political parties are &quot; not necessary &quot; for the good of the country .
disapproval of Congress is growing , and people &apos;s satisfaction with representative democracy has decreased .
in the midst of the epidemic , 66 % of Mexicans believe that the country is regressing .
seventy @-@ five percent of crimes are not reported due to lack of trust in the authorities , and 98 % of crimes are never resolved or punished .
public opinion seems disenchanted with a democracy incapable of offering tangible solutions to problems , the flu crisis being the most recent example .
saddled by a viral infection , drug @-@ related insecurity , and rising crime , Mexico feels like a besieged place .
the noted columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa wrote last week : &quot; all that &apos;s missing is for Mexico to get peed on by a dog . &quot;
Mexico &apos;s bad health is a symptom of problems that run deeper and are more widespread than swine flu .
over the past ten years , political and economic actors intent on preserving the status quo have blocked further democratic change and economic reform , condemning Mexico to move sideways , even as other emerging markets surge ahead .
lately , political battles among key actors have not been about how to build a more effective of representative political system or a more equitable , dynamic economy , but about how to maintain control of accumulated power or distribute it among their allies .
political parties appear far removed from citizen demands , beset by internal divisions , incapable of addressing deep @-@ rooted inequality and lawlessness , and prone to populist or authoritarian leadership that promises quick fixes to entrenched problems .
Mexico &apos;s current quandary is the flu , but it faces more important challenges than a mutating microbe .
with more than 40 million people living in poverty and 7,000 killed in drug @-@ related violence last year , Mexico will need to reform quickly to address what the virus has brought to light : a government far removed from the suffering of ordinary people and too frequently insensitive to their plight .
in this national crisis , Mexico &apos;s people have closed ranks , collaborated , and showed that they are capable of working together to achieve common goals in the public interest .
but their political and economic elites frequently seem incapable of doing so .
that is why home seems far , far away for so many Mexicans .
how Economics Survived the Economic Crisis
London - The tenth anniversary of the start of the Great Recession was the occasion for an elegant essay by the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman , who noted how little the debate about the causes and consequences of the crisis have changed over the last decade .
whereas the Great Depression of the 1930s produced Keynesian economics , and the stagflation of the 1970s produced Milton Friedman &apos;s monetarism , the Great Recession has produced no similar intellectual shift .
this is deeply depressing to young students of economics , who hoped for a suitably challenging response from the profession .
why has there been none ?
Krugman &apos;s answer is typically ingenious : the old macroeconomics was , as the saying goes , &quot; good enough for government work . &quot; it prevented another Great Depression .
so students should lock up their dreams and learn their lessons .
a decade ago , two schools of macroeconomists contended for primacy : the New Classical - or the &quot; freshwater &quot; - School , descended from Milton Friedman and Robert Lucas and headquartered at the University of Chicago , and the New Keynesian , or &quot; saltwater , &quot; School , descended from John Maynard Keynes , and based at MIT and Harvard .
freshwater @-@ types believed that budgets deficits were always bad , whereas the saltwater camp believed that deficits were beneficial in a slump .
Krugman is a New Keynesian , and his essay was intended to show that the Great Recession vindicated standard New Keynesian models .
but there are serious problems with Krugman &apos;s narrative .
for starters , there is his answer to Queen Elizabeth II &apos;s now @-@ famous question : &quot; why did no one see it coming ? &quot;
Krugman &apos;s cheerful response is that the New Keynesians were looking the other way .
theirs was a failure not of theory , but of &quot; data collection . &quot; they had &quot; overlooked &quot; crucial institutional changes in the financial system .
while this was regrettable , it raised no &quot; deep conceptual issue &quot; - that is , it didn &apos;t demand that they reconsider their theory .
faced with the crisis itself , the New Keynesians had risen to the challenge .
they dusted off their old sticky @-@ price models from the 1950s and 1960s , which told them three things . first , very large budget deficits would not drive up near @-@ zero interest rates .
second , even large increases in the monetary base would not lead to high inflation , or even to corresponding increases in broader monetary aggregates . and , third , there would be a positive national income multiplier , almost surely greater than one , from changes in government spending and taxation .
these propositions made the case for budget deficits in the aftermath of the collapse of 2008 .
policies based on them were implemented and worked &quot; remarkably well . &quot;
the success of New Keynesian policy had the ironic effect of allowing &quot; the more inflexible members of our profession &#91; the New Classicals from Chicago &#93; to ignore events in a way they couldn &apos;t in past episodes . &quot; so neither school - sect might be the better word - was challenged to re @-@ think first principles .
this clever history of pre- and post @-@ crash economics leaves key questions unanswered .
first , if New Keynesian economics was &quot; good enough , &quot; why didn &apos;t New Keynesian economists urge precautions against the collapse of 2007 @-@ 2008 ?
after all , they did not rule out the possibility of such a collapse a priori .
Krugman admits to a gap in &quot; evidence collection . &quot; but the choice of evidence is theory @-@ driven .
in my view , New Keynesian economists turned a blind eye to instabilities building up in the banking system , because their models told them that financial institutions could accurately price risk .
so there was a &quot; deep conceptual issue &quot; involved in New Keynesian analysis : its failure to explain how banks might come to &quot; underprice risk worldwide , &quot; as Alan Greenspan put it .
second , Krugman fails to explain why the Keynesian policies vindicated in 2008 @-@ 2009 were so rapidly reversed and replaced by fiscal austerity .
why didn &apos;t policymakers stick to their stodgy fixed @-@ price models until they had done their work ?
why abandon them in 2009 , when Western economies were still 4 @-@ 5 % below their pre @-@ crash levels ?
the answer I would give is that when Keynes was briefly exhumed for six months in 2008 @-@ 2009 , it was for political , not intellectual , reasons .
because the New Keynesian models did not offer a sufficient basis for maintaining Keynesian policies once the economic emergency had been overcome , they were quickly abandoned .
Krugman comes close to acknowledging this : new Keynesians , he writes , &quot; start with rational behavior and market equilibrium as a baseline , and try to get economic dysfunction by tweaking that baseline at the edges . &quot;
such tweaks enable New Keynesian models to generate temporary real effects from nominal shocks , and thus justify quite radical intervention in times of emergency .
but no tweaks can create a strong enough case to justify sustained interventionist policy .
the problem for New Keynesian macroeconomists is that they fail to acknowledge radical uncertainty in their models , leaving them without any theory of what to do in good times in order to avoid the bad times .
their focus on nominal wage and price rigidities implies that if these factors were absent , equilibrium would readily be achieved .
they regard the financial sector as neutral , not as fundamental ( capitalism &apos;s &quot; ephor , &quot; as Joseph Schumpeter put it ) .
without acknowledgement of uncertainty , saltwater economics is bound to collapse into its freshwater counterpart .
new Keynesian &quot; tweaking &quot; will create limited political space for intervention , but not nearly enough to do a proper job .
so Krugman &apos;s argument , while provocative , is certainly not conclusive .
macroeconomics still needs to come up with a big new idea .
why a Sino @-@ American Cold War Won &apos;t happen
Oxford - It is often said that the US and China - superpowers at economic , geopolitical , and ideological loggerheads - are heading toward a new cold war .
and the rhetoric - at least from one side - has come to resemble that of Winston Churchill &apos;s 1946 &quot; Iron Curtain &quot; speech , one of the inaugural events of the Cold War .
just this month , US Vice President Mike Pence accused China of predatory economic practices , military aggression against the United States , and attempts to undermine US President Donald Trump .
but despite the media hype , a new cold war is not inevitable - or even likely .
to be sure , Chinese leaders , fearing disorder and any weakening of the Communist Party of China &apos;s legitimacy , are determined to prevent the US from forcing changes on China &apos;s political and economic system .
China will continue to pursue reforms at its own pace and in its own way .
for Chinese President Xi Jinping , a top priority is to merge the CPC with the machinery of government in order to reduce corruption and burnish the state &apos;s ideological credentials .
any attempt to interfere in this process would be crossing a red line .
fortunately for Xi , Trump has no interest in &quot; democratizing &quot; other countries , and he doesn &apos;t seem to have been swayed by the US investors , financiers , and technology titans who want his administration to press for more access to the Chinese economy .
no doubt , US tariffs threaten the 18 % of Chinese exports that go to the US each year .
but the Trump administration has more urgent priorities than changing China &apos;s system of government , notwithstanding the aggressive rhetoric of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro .
Trump desperately wants to bolster US manufacturing by repatriating global supply chains and blocking or curbing imports .
&quot; make America Great Again &quot; is really about making in America again .
still , even if today &apos;s US @-@ China standoff does not evolve into a new cold war , it could weaken both countries and usher in a more multipolar world .
within China , US rhetorical broadsides , tariffs , and sanctions may be empowering Xi &apos;s domestic critics .
and it doesn &apos;t help that China currently has limited options for retaliating .
true , it could start to sell off some of its $ 1 trillion in US dollar reserves .
but that would weaken the value of the US Treasuries that it continues to hold .
within the US , Trump &apos;s decision to pursue sweeping import tariffs has been described by one industry representative as &quot; the most self @-@ destructive trade act I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
and the administration &apos;s renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement - which includes a clause to prevent Canada or Mexico from negotiating with China - has met with similar disdain .
such policies threaten both to destroy US jobs and to alienate America &apos;s allies , many of which are already distancing themselves .
indeed , the Trump administration &apos;s &quot; America First &quot; positions have increasingly translated into &quot; America Alone . &quot;
the US now constitutes a minority of one within the G7 , the G20 , and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .
after Trump pulled the US out of the Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) , the remaining parties moved ahead on their own .
far from setting the terms of debate on international issues , the Trump administration has convinced other countries to reduce their reliance on US leadership .
widespread circumvention of the US will hasten the emergence of a new multipolar order .
for example , by withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal , Trump has essentially dared the United Kingdom , France , Germany , China , Russia , and the European Union to defy US prerogatives .
for now , countries that rely on Iranian oil may have no choice but to go along with the US .
like most traded goods , oil exports are paid for in dollars - largely through the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) in Belgium - and the US has the power to shut down such transactions .
most companies and countries have concluded that doing business in Iran is not worth losing access to the US market and the international dollar @-@ payments system .
but in the future , they may no longer have to make such tradeoffs .
on August 21 , Germany &apos;s foreign minister , Heiko Maas , urged Europe to establish payment channels that are independent of the US .
and the following month , the EU &apos;s foreign policy chief announced plans to form a &quot; special purpose vehicle &quot; to &quot; assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with Iran . &quot;
meanwhile , Russia has said that it is developing its own system for financial transfers , to protect itself from being shut out of the SWIFT system in the event of harsher US sanctions .
and China has been pursuing a similar project at least since 2015 , when the People &apos;s Bank of China launched a system to facilitate cross @-@ border transactions in renminbi .
none of these alternative systems have yet to match the convenience of SWIFT and the dollar system .
but if a new system were to take hold , it could rapidly shift power away from the US .
rather than a cold war , the world may be heading toward an international system led by four powers , with the US , China , Russia , and Germany dominating their respective regions and seeking the upper hand in international negotiations .
such a scenario is reminiscent of the World War II vision of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt , who proposed that the four victorious allies - the US , the UK , China , and the Soviet Union - act as &quot; Four policemen , &quot; each patrolling its own sphere of influence and negotiating with the others on world peace .
today , approximations of the same four powers are once again in the lead , only now we have stronger international institutions to help keep the peace .
whether that peace lasts will depend on the willingness of the four powers to use and adapt those institutions to the emerging international system .
natural @-@ Born pianists ?
London - The editor of The Guardian , Alan Rusbridger , has written a book about how he decided to practice the piano 20 minutes a day .
eighteen months later , he played Chopin &apos;s fearsomely difficult Ballade No. 1 in G Minor to an admiring audience of friends .
could anyone have done this ?
or did it require special talent ?
the nature @-@ versus @-@ nurture debate has been around a long time . it is unresolved because the scientific question has always been entangled with politics .
broadly speaking , those stressing inborn capacity have been political conservatives ; those emphasizing nurture have been political radicals .
the nineteenth @-@ century philosopher John Stuart Mill was of the &quot; anyone can do it &quot; school .
he was convinced that his achievements were in no way due to superior heredity : anyone of &quot; normal intelligence and health , &quot; subjected to his father &apos;s educational system - which included learning Greek at the age of three - could have become John Stuart Mill .
Mill was part of his century &apos;s liberal attack on aristocratic privilege : achievement was the result of opportunity , not birth .
the practice of the faculties ( education ) unleashes potential that would otherwise remain dormant .
Charles Darwin seemingly overturned this optimistic view of the potential beneficial effects of nurture .
species evolve , Darwin said , through &quot; natural selection &quot; - the random selection , through competition , of biological traits favorable to survival in a world of scarce resources .
Herbert Spencer used the phrase &quot; survival of the fittest &quot; to explain how societies evolve .
social Darwinists interpreted natural selection to mean that any humanitarian effort to improve the condition of the poor would impede the progress of the human race by burdening it with an excess of drones .
society would be spending scarce resources on losers rather than winners .
this fit the ideology of a brand of capitalism that was &quot; red in tooth and claw . &quot;
indeed , social Darwinism provided a pseudo @-@ scientific justification for the American belief in laissez @-@ faire ( with the successful businessman epitomizing the survival of the fittest ) ; for eugenics ( the deliberate attempt to breed superior individuals , on the model of horse @-@ breeding , and prevent the &quot; over @-@ breeding &quot; of the unfit ) ; and for the eugenic @-@ cum @-@ racial theories of Nazism .
in reaction to social Darwinism &apos;s murderous tendencies , Mill &apos;s view became dominant after World War II in the form of social democracy .
state action to improve diet , education , health , and housing would enable the poor to realize their potential .
competition as a social principle was downgraded in favor of cooperation .
differences in innate ability were not denied ( at least by the sensible ) .
but it was rightly felt that there was a huge amount of work to be done to raise average levels of achievement before one needed to start worrying that one &apos;s policies were promoting the survival of the unfit .
then the mood began to shift again .
social democracy was attacked for penalizing the successful and rewarding the unsuccessful .
in 1976 , the biologist Richard Dawkins identified the unit of Darwinian selection as the &quot; selfish gene . &quot;
the evolutionary story was now recast as a battle of genes to secure their survival over time by means of mutations , which create individuals ( phenotypes ) best adapted to pass on their genes .
in the course of evolution , the inferior phenotypes disappear .
although this view of evolution would not have been possible before the discovery of DNA , it is no coincidence that it rose to prominence in the age of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher .
to be sure , the selfish gene needs to be &quot; altruistic &quot; insofar as its survival depends on the survival of the kinship group .
but it need not be that altruistic .
and , although Dawkins later regretted calling his gene &quot; selfish &quot; ( he says that &quot; immortal &quot; would have been better ) , his choice of adjective was certainly best adapted to maximizing sales of his book at that particular time .
since then , we have turned away from advocacy of selfishness , but we have not recovered an independent moral language .
the new orthodoxy , suitable for a world in which the unrestrained pursuit of greed has proved economically disastrous , is that the human species is genetically programmed to be moral , because only by acting morally ( caring for the survival of others ) can it ensure its long @-@ term survival .
the &quot; hard @-@ wiring &quot; metaphor dominates contemporary moral language .
according to the United Kingdom &apos;s chief rabbi , Jonathan sacks , religious beliefs are useful for our survival , by inducing us to act in socially cooperative ways : &quot; we have mirror neurons that lead us to feel pain when we see others suffering , &quot; he recently wrote .
consideration for others is &quot; located in the prefrontal cortex . &quot;
and religion &quot; reconfigures our neural pathways . &quot; in short : &quot; far from refuting religion , the Neo @-@ Darwinists have helped us understand why it matters . &quot;
so we need not fear that it will decline .
atheists might not agree .
but it is an extraordinary statement for a religious leader to make , because it sets to one side the question of the truth or falsehood , or the ethical value , of religious beliefs .
or rather : all that wiring in the prefrontal cortex must be ethical , because it is good for survival .
but , in that case , what ethical value is there in survival ?
does the continued survival of the human race have any value in itself , independent of what we achieve or create ?
we need to rescue morality from the claims of science .
we need to assert what philosophers and religious teachers have at all times asserted : that there is something called the good life , apart from survival , and our understanding of it has to be taught , just as Mill &apos;s father taught him the elements of Aristotle &apos;s Posterior Analytics .
our nature may predispose us to learn ; but what we learn depends on how we are nurtured .
Obama &apos;s Rocky Path to Success in Syria
new YORK - In my experience , if you are attacked for your diplomacy from both left and right , by doves and hawks , and by internationalists and isolationists , you probably have it just right .
in the avalanche of commentary on this month &apos;s US @-@ Russia deal on Syria &apos;s chemical weapons , few have been prepared to call it a &quot; win @-@ win @-@ win &quot; outcome for the United States , Russia , and the Syrian people .
but - at least so far - that is what it is .
President Barack Obama and his team , despite some missteps , deserve most of the credit .
the charge sheet against Obama over Syria is long .
the US , it is said , took no decisive action while 100,000 Syrians were dying , and it had no strategy to end the conflict .
Obama created expectations that the US would act if chemical weapons were used , only to stall when the time came .
then , when a response became unavoidable , he threatened both too much and too little military force .
he paid too little , then too much , attention to domestic opponents of intervention .
above all , he allowed an ever @-@ cynical Kremlin to outplay the US diplomatically .
but consider the constraints .
there was never a time in the crisis , until the chemical @-@ weapons issue erupted , when US military intervention in any form seemed likely to save more lives than it would endanger .
the increasing influence of jihadists in the rebel ranks made support for an outright opposition victory increasingly untenable .
there simply was not enough hard evidence of Syrian President Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s use of chemical weapons , at least before the Ghouta massacre in August , to pressure Russia - either in the United Nations Security Council or the court of global opinion - to reconsider its reflex support of the regime .
moreover , while the Obama administration remained determined to preserve US leadership in responding - with force , where necessary - to mass atrocity crimes ( the global &quot; responsibility to protect &quot; agenda ) , a decade of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan has left Americans desperately war @-@ weary .
that is true in the West generally , as shown by the United Kingdom &apos;s parliamentary vote against participating in any intervention .
for almost everyone , George W. Bush &apos;s &quot; decisiveness &quot; made vacillation seem like a better option .
against this background , consider what Obama has achieved .
a descent into chemical @-@ weapons hell has been averted , almost certainly permanently : the Assad regime knows that it has no friends or protectors left should it cross that red line again .
military intervention , with all of its problems , has been avoided for now ; but Assad knows that the US will have no option but to attack - with or without explicit Security Council and Congressional resolutions - should he perpetrate another such horror .
above all , diplomatic cooperation on chemical weapons has opened the door at last to a negotiated settlement of the underlying conflict in Syria .
and the UN is back at center stage , as a rules @-@ based international order demands that it should be on such issues , with both its weapons inspectors and the Security Council regarded as central to future developments .
yes , there were some things that could and should have been done differently .
there always are .
if the justified intervention in Libya by the US , the UK , and France had not later been conducted with such cloth @-@ eared indifference to Russian , Chinese , and developing @-@ country concern about mandate overreach , greater unity on Syria could have been achieved in the Security Council in 2011 , when a united message might have stopped Assad cold .
going to Congress for approval was always going to involve more risks than rewards .
Secretary of State John Kerry &apos;s description of the planned US military response to the Ghouta massacre as likely to be &quot; unbelievably small &quot; almost derailed the utility of the US threat in concentrating Syrian and Russian officials &quot; minds .
and the administration could have helped itself by better explaining that a cooperative response to the Assad regime &apos;s use of chemical weapons had long been on the table , and was not just the result of deftly opportunistic Russian diplomacy in response to a Kerry thought @-@ bubble .
what has trumped these missteps , and enabled each side to focus on opportunities rather than excuses , is that both the US and Russia now understand that they have common interests in Syria .
both sides want not only to preclude the Assad regime &apos;s further use of chemical weapons , but also to find a route to sustainable peace in Syria , and to reestablish the authority and utility of the UN in these situations .
of course , optimism must be tempered .
plenty can go wrong in the period ahead .
either a beleaguered Assad or an increasingly desperate opposition might destroy the deal on the ground .
the fragile rapprochement between the US and Russia may not hold , particularly if the US again insists - breaking its recent helpful silence - that Assad has no place at the negotiating table .
but when the major powers cooperate in a just cause , the world is a safer and saner place .
that is where both the US and Russia - and on this issue China as well - want to be .
if Obama &apos;s caution and flexibility have been the key to getting us here , let us give praise where it is due .
the US with Iran in Syria
Princeton - The prospect of a US military strike on Syria has dimmed following President Barack Obama &apos;s embrace of an international initiative to take control of Syria &apos;s chemical @-@ weapons stockpile .
the eleventh @-@ hour U @-@ turn on the push for military action has come against a backdrop of intensifying diplomatic pressure from the international community to avoid escalation of the violence in Syria .
and that outcome is not possible without Iran .
in a joint press conference with his Syrian counterpart , Walid al @-@ Moallem , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov tabled a proposal , originally agreed with Iran , calling for Syria to &quot; place chemical weapons storage sites under international control . &quot;
the stockpiles would then be destroyed and Syria would fully join the international Chemical Weapons Convention .
the second component of the Russian @-@ Iranian proposal calls for international efforts , under the auspices of the United Nations Security Council , to rein in Syrian rebel forces &quot; chemical @-@ weapons capabilities .
Moallem immediately embraced the proposal .
hours later , UN Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon did as well , while Obama said that &quot; I fervently hope that this can be resolved in a non @-@ military way . &quot;
this initiative would allow Obama to escape from a messy political and foreign @-@ policy predicament .
but the matter is far from settled : Obama has not ruled out a military strike .
so here are 12 reasons why America should grasp the opportunity for a diplomatic resolution afforded by the Russian @-@ Iranian plan .
first , there is evidence that the Syrian opposition has amassed chemical weapons .
in December 2012 , Iran officially informed the US about chemical weapons , including sarin gas , being transferred to Syria .
the US declined to cooperate with Iran to press ahead on the case .
second , US military strikes on Syria have the potential to engulf the entire region - and perhaps the US - in a broader war .
after its experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade , the US can hardly afford a Syrian quagmire .
third , with the regional Sunni @-@ Shia conflict intensifying , the prospect of tens of billions of petrodollars backing terrorist extremists has already destabilized the region .
US military strikes against Syria would further fuel extremism and result in widespread atrocities by the rebels against Syrians of all faiths .
reports point to the execution and mutilation of Syrian @-@ government prisoners .
there is no doubt that the fate of Syria &apos;s Christian and Jewish communities is now extremely precarious .
fourth , America &apos;s decision to back extremists in Syria contradicts its &quot; war on terrorism &quot; and will erode international support for it .
the prospect of Iranian cooperation to root out Al Qaeda extremists , which it provided in Afghanistan and Iraq , would be unlikely following any intervention .
fifth , it is wrong to assume that without Syrian President Bashar al @-@ Assad , Iran would lose its influence in the Muslim world as well as its link to Hezbollah in Lebanon .
America &apos;s regional position weakened , and Iran &apos;s strengthened , following the US @-@ led invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq ; US intervention in Syria could reproduce that pattern .
sixth , a US attack on Syria would leave the US isolated internationally and end any hope of a diplomatic resolution .
there is no domestic or international appetite for another US military adventure - NATO , the G @-@ 20 , the Europeans , Russia , China , and 60 % of Americans oppose a unilateral US military strike .
seventh , the civilian casualties arising from a military strike would be high .
if the main justification for an attack is humanitarian - to end the senseless slaughter of Syrian civilians - US military intervention would do more harm than good .
eighth , US involvement in Syria will breathe new life into efforts to press for a wider war between the US and Iran .
al Qaeda affiliates will target US regional interests in the hope that the blame falls on Iran and its militant proxies - providing a pretext for US military confrontation .
ninth , a US military strike against a third Muslim @-@ majority country would demolish the credibility of Obama &apos;s efforts to repair America &apos;s image in the Islamic world .
indeed , it would most likely prove to be a strategic boon to the &quot; resistance axis &quot; - Iran and Hezbollah .
tenth , any US unilateral military strike against Syria would ratchet up tensions between the US and Russia .
this , in turn , would strengthen the Russia @-@ Iran alliance .
eleventh , Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has issued permission for President Hassan Rouhani &apos;s new administration to enter into direct talks with the US .
no better opportunity to end decades of bilateral hostility is likely to come along .
in these circumstances , a US attack on Syria would almost certainly dash any hope of a US @-@ Iran rapprochement for years to come .
finally , with the moderate Rouhani now installed as President , a US military strike could undermine a golden opportunity for America and Iran to reach a face @-@ saving solution ( for both sides ) on Iran &apos;s nuclear program .
both Iran and the US consider the use of weapons of mass destruction a grave crime .
indeed , Iran was a major victim of chemical @-@ weapons attacks during its 1980 @-@ 1988 war with Saddam Hussein &apos;s Iraq .
Iran can be a major partner to halt proliferation of WMDs in Syria , the Middle East , and beyond .
Iran maintains that the Security Council is the only body legally authorized to verify allegations concerning the use of such deadly weapons and to decide on the appropriate response .
one promising avenue for US @-@ Iran cooperation on Syria could be joint support for a fact @-@ finding mission by the Security Council to identify the perpetrators .
Obama has his &quot; red line &quot; on the use of chemical weapons .
so does Khamenei .
why Pay More for Fairness ?
marks &amp; Spencer , a supermarket and clothing chain with 400 stores throughout Britain , recently announced that it is converting its entire range of coffee and tea , totaling 38 lines , to Fairtrade , a marketing symbol of &quot; ethical production . &quot;
the chain already sells only Fairtrade tea and coffee in its 200 Café Revive coffee shops .
it is also boosting its purchases of shirts and other goods made with Fairtrade cotton .
the announcement came during &quot; Fairtrade fortnight , &quot; a two @-@ week promotion of Fairtrade products that included speaking tours by farmers from developing countries , telling Britons how Fairtrade has assisted their communities .
the movement toward more ethical consumption has made significant gains in the United States as well , as consumers increasingly turn to organic , locally produced foods , and eggs from hens not kept in cages .
in the UK , a survey has found that half of those shown the Fairtrade symbol recognized it and understood that it refers to products that give a better deal for Third World farmers .
there is no comparable US research , but related data , and discussions with my own students , suggests that the figure would be much lower .
traders seeking Fairtrade certification must pay producers a price that covers the costs of sustainable production and provides a living wage .
for example , the minimum price for coffee is $ 1.26 per pound , no matter how low the market price may fall .
if the market price rises above that figure , the fair trade price will increase so that it remains five cents per pound higher .
small farmers , for their part , are required to be organized in cooperatives or other groups that allow democratic participation .
plantations and factories can use the Fairtrade label if they pay their workers decent wages , comply with health , safety , and environmental standards , allow unions or other forms of workers &quot; associations , provide good housing if workers are not living at home , and do not use child labor or forced labor .
not every one approves of Fairtrade .
brink Lindsey , director of the pro @-@ market Cato Institute &apos;s Center for Trade Policy Studies , believes that the campaign for Fairtrade coffee is a &quot; well @-@ meaning dead end . &quot;
with some justification , he argues that the real cause of the fall in coffee prices was not the profiteering of multinationals , but big increases in coffee production in Brazil and Vietnam , combined with new techniques that make it possible to grow coffee with less labor and hence more cheaply .
in Lindsey &apos;s view , if we want to assist coffee growers , we should encourage them either to abandon coffee and produce more profitable crops - and here he rightly points to rich nations &quot; trade barriers and subsidies as obstacles that must be dismantled - or to move into higher @-@ value products , like specialty coffees , that bring higher prices .
what is curious about Lindsey &apos;s argument , however , is that the Fairtrade coffee campaign can be seen as doing just what he recommends - encouraging coffee farmers to produce a specialty coffee that brings a higher price .
pro @-@ market economists don &apos;t object to corporations that blatantly use snob appeal to promote their products .
if people want to pay $ 48 for a pound of Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee because that &apos;s what James Bond prefers , economists don &apos;t object that the market is being distorted .
so why be critical when consumers choose to pay $ 12 for a pound of coffee that they know has been grown without toxic chemicals , under shade trees that help birds to survive , by farmers who can now afford to feed and educate their children ?
economists might reply that if you want to help people feed and educate their children , you can pay $ 10 for a pound of non @-@ Fairtrade coffee that tastes the same and give the $ 2 you save to an aid agency that provides food and education to poor children .
that &apos;s a possible strategy , but there are advantages to Fairtrade .
the growers know that they have to provide a product that consumers like , both for its taste and for the way it is grown .
if their product sells well , they can take pride in having produced something that is sought after around the world .
from the growers &quot; perspective , receiving a premium by selling a Fairtrade product is preferable to receiving a charitable handout that they would get whether they worked or not and regardless of the quality of what they produce .
paying more for a Fairtrade label is no more &quot; anti @-@ market &quot; than paying more for a Gucci label , and it reflects better ethical priorities .
Fairtrade is not a government subsidy .
its success depends on market demand , not political lobbying .
fortunately , in Europe , that market demand is growing rapidly .
one hopes that it will soon reach similar levels throughout the developed world , and wherever people can make choices about their discretionary spending .
the Populist War Against Intelligence
Atlanta - Despite his seemingly limitless capacity for vindictiveness , it would be a mistake to interpret US President Donald Trump &apos;s decision to withdraw the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan as only his latest vendetta for lèse @-@ majesté .
true , Brennan has all but labeled Trump and his behavior , including his Russian connections , a national security threat .
but Trump &apos;s move is more than personal payback .
as the most recent blow in his two @-@ year @-@ long attack on the intelligence community , his slap at Brennan is a harbinger of more to come as he tries to bring his espionage agencies to heel .
more ominously for the health of the democracies of the West , other populists are following Trump &apos;s example .
in Europe , a variety of right @-@ wing parties , having now found themselves in power , are taking on former government antagonists , who have monitored and policed their extremism for decades .
in Austria , the country &apos;s populist leaders have been intimidating , muzzling , and purging the country &apos;s intelligence services .
in February , on orders from the populist interior minister , Austrian police raided the country &apos;s main intelligence agency - the very organization charged with monitoring right @-@ wing extremism .
( it should be recalled that the Freedom Party , the coalition partner in Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz &apos;s government , was founded by ex @-@ SS officers ) .
and what was the pretext for the raid and subsequent demotion of senior Austrian intelligence officials ?
that the agency was running an operation aimed at harming North Korea .
no doubt , Trump wishes that he could pull off such a stunt , and both halt the investigation of him led by Robert Mueller and bring to heel all of the US intelligence agencies .
a fan of strongman leaders who &quot; get it done , &quot; Trump admires diktats and brazen contempt for legal processes .
he almost certainly will pay even closer attention as the intelligence @-@ fueled investigations into his presidential campaign &apos;s possible collusion with Moscow in 2016 close in on him .
it is this combination of self @-@ interest and contempt for law that makes Trump &apos;s revocation of the Brennan &apos;s security clearance so troubling .
the regulations governing clearances are straightforward : the president has the power to deny access to official secrets if someone is found to have compromised classified information or is at risk of doing so .
by all accounts , Brennan has done nothing of the sort .
in fact , Trump admits that .
buried in the explanatory word salad that accompanied the revocation of Brennan &apos;s security clearance , the White House claimed that Brennan &apos;s &quot; erratic &quot; behavior was the cause .
that accusation would be laughable if it wasn &apos;t so serious .
Trump has simply ignored the laws - including laws governing the US intelligence services - that he swore faithfully to execute .
eleven former CIA directors and deputy directors , as well as 70 former senior CIA officers ( including me ) , said as much last week , criticizing the unprecedented revocation as political coercion and accusing Trump of misusing presidential powers , damaging national security , and threatening current and former officials &quot; right of free speech .
as if to underscore the point , White House spokespeople say that Trump intends to order more revocations , including a former national security adviser and deputy attorney general , as well as former directors of national intelligence , the CIA and the National Security Agency .
the hit list is no coincidence .
those in the crosshairs have overseen intelligence collection and analysis that informed the intelligence community &apos;s conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election , including possible collusion with Trump &apos;s presidential campaign .
with attacks on the intelligence and law enforcement communities playing well among his supporters , Trump could well double down on this demagoguery .
but his willingness to use his presidential powers as a blatantly partisan political weapon breaks ground that no American should want him to tread .
the damage that has resulted from the raid in Austria shows why .
while Austrian courts ultimately will determine the raid &apos;s legality , the effects are already clear .
by stripping Austria &apos;s spies of their files , the raid has essentially put the intelligence service out of operation and raised doubts among allied intelligence services about the Austrians &quot; reliability .
internal operations are dead in the water , as is intelligence sharing with European counterparts .
Washington is not Vienna , but the parallels deserve close attention nonetheless .
Trump &apos;s attacks on the intelligence community and its former leaders are unprecedented , and it would be naive not to consider their impact , not only on the current intelligence leadership but also on the rank @-@ and @-@ file officers that do the difficult and often dangerous work of intelligence gathering and analysis .
that is why it is so important to adhere to the laws that empower ( and constrain ) intelligence agencies and that underpin the political independence and integrity of their officers .
events in Austria should be a warning .
for democracies to thrive , government must be transparent as well as publicly accountable .
when it comes to overseeing intelligence agencies pledged to protect their sources and methods , the challenges are obvious .
but so , too , are the threats , including to the democratic process itself , when politicians violate rather than respect the rules that govern their intelligence services &quot; integrity .
in the final analysis , Brennan isn &apos;t the only victim of Trump &apos;s unwarranted and vindictive action .
so are all Americans when national leaders put their own interests above those of the country and corrupt the political system they are sworn to defend .
why Putin Makes a Bad Ally
Stanford - Russian President Vladimir Putin &apos;s intervention in the Syrian conflict has been welcomed by some as a moment for the Kremlin to &quot; come in from the cold . &quot;
Russia &apos;s conflict with the Islamic State , the argument goes , has aligned the country &apos;s interests with those of the West .
even Turkey &apos;s downing of a Russian warplane does not seem not to have deflated this optimism .
indeed , at a recent press conference , US President Barack Obama again urged Putin to join the alliance against the Islamic State .
and French President François Hollande billed his recent visit to Moscow as an effort to build a broad international coalition against the terrorist group .
at first blush , the idea that Russia is a natural ally against Islamist terrorists seems to make sense .
the country has suffered horrific terrorist attacks by Islamist extremists , including the bombing in November of a plane above the Sinai Peninsula , which killed 224 passengers and crew , nearly all of them Russian .
around 20 million Muslims , most of them Sunni , live within the Russian Federation , and the country &apos;s security officials report that some 7,000 fighters from the former Soviet republics and Russia have joined the Islamic State .
on deeper examination , however , it becomes clear that an anti @-@ terror alliance with Russia is wishful thinking .
Putin has not gone into Syria to defeat the Islamic State .
he has intervened to save the regime of Russia &apos;s client , Syrian President Bashar al @-@ Assad .
Putin may sometimes give the appearance that he is ready to abandon Assad , but ultimately he will defend him .
leaving Assad to his fate would be a sign of weakness - and thus anathema to Putin .
ordinary Russians may be in danger of attacks by Islamic extremists , but they pose little threat to Putin or his allies .
Russia has indeed suffered a number of terrorist attacks , including the 2004 Beslan massacre , in which 334 people , most of them schoolchildren , were killed .
in nearly every case , the response to the attacks was brutal , inept , and costly in terms of civilian lives lost .
and yet the Putin regime has emerged unscathed each time .
indeed , terrorist attacks at the turn of the century solidified public opinion against Chechen rebels and gave Putin the public support he needed to raze Grozny , Chechnya &apos;s capital .
Putin &apos;s confidence in dealing with terrorism reflects the design of Russia &apos;s security state .
Russia spends more on internal security than it does on national defense .
it has interior ministry troops , federal security agency ( FSB ) special forces , OMON ( mobile special service ) troops , military intelligence troops , and a vast network of internal spies and informants .
regime opponents are not allowed to run for office , their rights to demonstrate are restricted , and they are subject to a legal arbitrariness in the courts .
citizens have virtually no protection from wiretaps or the interception of their electronic communications .
every society must balance civil rights against national security .
Putin &apos;s Russia has swung to one extreme of the spectrum , while the United States and Europe ( despite the protests of civil libertarians ) have chosen to occupy the other end .
indeed , Russia is an example of the upper limit of what state power can do to control terrorist activity .
it would be a rare extremist group that had not been infiltrated with an informant who reports to Moscow .
there is even evidence that those who carried out the Beslan massacre were infiltrated by Russian intelligence .
moreover , any terrorist group knows that their operations will be met with the most extreme use of force .
in Beslan , for example , Russian special forces used thermobaric weapons .
as the reaction to the attacks in Paris illustrates , the seemingly random murder of 130 civilians has monumental resonance in the West - especially when the religious and ideological motives are difficult to understand .
but the Kremlin places a lower value on human lives than Western societies do .
in Putin &apos;s calculations , the loss of lives in extremist attacks is unwelcome , but ultimately acceptable if it does not threaten the regime .
the Russian people might be horrified and frightened .
but the Russian regime is primarily concerned with its own survival - and with how it might use the public &apos;s horror to its benefit .
working with the West to combat the Islamic State serves neither of those purposes .
hard to be Easing
new YORK - The United States Federal Reserve &apos;s decision to undertake a third round of quantitative easing , or QE3 , has raised three important questions . will QE3 jump @-@ start America &apos;s anemic economic growth ?
will it lead to a persistent increase in risky assets , especially in US and other global equity markets ?
finally , will its effects on GDP growth and equity markets be similar or different ?
many now argue that QE3 &quot; s effect on risky assets should be as powerful , if not more so , than that of QE1 , QE2 , and &quot; Operation Twist , &quot; the Fed &apos;s earlier bond @-@ purchase program .
after all , while the previous rounds of US monetary easing have been associated with a persistent increase in equity prices , the size and duration of QE3 are more substantial .
but , despite the Fed &apos;s impressive commitment to aggressive monetary easing , its effects on the real economy and on US equities could well be smaller and more fleeting than those of previous QE rounds .
consider , first , that the previous QE rounds came at times of much lower equity valuations and earnings .
in March 2009 , the S &amp; P 500 index was down to 660 , earnings per share ( EPS ) of US companies and banks had sunk to a financial @-@ crisis low , and price / earnings ratios were in the single digits .
today , the S &amp; P 500 is more than 100 % higher ( hovering near 1,430 ) , the average EPS is close to $ 100 , and P / E ratios are above 14 .
even during QE2 , in the summer of 2010 , the S &amp; P 500 , P / E ratios , and EPS were much lower than they are today .
if , as is likely , economic growth in the US remains anemic in spite of QE3 , top @-@ line revenues and bottom @-@ line earnings will turn south , with negative effects on equity valuations .
moreover , fiscal support is absent this time : QE1 and QE2 helped to prevent a deeper recession and avoid a double dip , respectively , because each was associated with a significant fiscal stimulus .
in contrast , QE3 will be associated with a fiscal contraction , possibly even a large fiscal cliff .
even if the US avoids the full fiscal cliff of 4.5 % of GDP that is looming at the end of the year , it is highly likely that a fiscal drag amounting to 1.5 % of GDP will hit the economy in 2013 .
with the US economy currently growing at a 1.6 % annual rate , a fiscal drag of even 1 % implies near @-@ stagnation in 2013 , though a modest recovery in housing and manufacturing , together with QE3 , should keep US growth at about its current level in 2013 .
but there is no broader rebound underway .
in both 2010 and 2011 , leading economic indicators showed that the first @-@ half slowdown had bottomed out , and that growth was already accelerating before the announcement of monetary easing .
thus , QE nudged along an economy that was already recovering , which prolonged asset reflation .
by contrast , the latest data suggest that the US economy is performing as sluggishly now as it was in the first half of the year .
indeed , if anything , weakness in the US labor market , low capital expenditures , and slow income growth have contradicted signals in the early summer that third @-@ quarter growth might be more robust .
meanwhile , the main transmission channels of monetary stimulus to the real economy - the bond , credit , currency , and stock markets - remain weak , if not broken .
indeed , the bond @-@ market channel is unlikely to boost growth .
long @-@ term government bond yields are already very low , and a further reduction will not significantly change private agents &quot; borrowing costs .
the credit channel also is not working properly , as banks have hoarded most of the extra liquidity from QE , creating excess reserves rather than increasing lending .
those who can borrow have ample cash and are cautious about spending , while those who want to borrow - highly indebted households and firms ( especially small and medium @-@ size enterprises ) - face a credit crunch .
the currency channel is similarly impaired .
with global growth weakening , net exports are unlikely to improve robustly , even with a weaker dollar .
moreover , many major central banks are implementing variants of QE alongside the Fed , dampening the effect of the Fed &apos;s actions on the dollar &apos;s value .
perhaps most important , a weaker dollar &apos;s effect on the trade balance , and thus on growth , is limited by two factors .
first , a weaker dollar is associated with a higher dollar price for commodities , which implies a drag on the trade balance , because the US is a net commodity @-@ importing country .
second , any improvement in GDP derived from stronger exports leads to an increase in imports .
empirical studies estimate that the overall impact of a weaker US dollar on the trade balance is close to zero .
the only other significant channel to transmit QE to the real economy is the wealth effect of an equity @-@ market increase , but there is some circularity in the argument that QE3 will lead to a persistent rise in equity prices .
if persistent asset reflation requires a significant GDP growth recovery , it is tautological to say that if equity prices rise enough following QE , the resulting increase in GDP from a wealth effect justifies the rise in asset prices .
if monetary policy &apos;s transmission channels to the real economy are broken , one cannot assume that QE will have a significant effect on economic growth .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has recently emphasized the importance of an additional channel : the confidence channel , through which the Fed &apos;s commitment to maintaining generous monetary conditions for longer could improve private spending .
the issue is how substantial and durable such effects will be .
confidence is fragile in an environment characterized by ongoing deleveraging , macro uncertainties , weak labor @-@ market growth , and a fiscal drag .
in short , QE3 reduces the tail risk of an outright economic contraction , but is unlikely to lead to a sustained recovery in an economy that is still enduring a painful deleveraging process .
in the short run , QE3 will lead investors to take on risk , and will stimulate modest asset reflation .
but the equity @-@ price rise is likely to fizzle out over time if economic growth disappoints , as is likely , and drags down expectations about corporate revenues and profitability .
quantitative quicksand
Pittsburgh - Almost all recoveries from recession have included rapid employment growth - until now .
though advanced @-@ country central banks have pursued expansionary monetary policy in the wake of the global economic crisis in an effort to boost demand , job creation has lagged .
as a result , workers , increasingly convinced that they will be unable to find employment for a sustained period , are leaving the labor force in droves .
nowhere is this phenomenon more pronounced than in the United States , where the Federal Reserve has reduced interest rates to unprecedented levels and , through quantitative easing ( QE ) , augmented bank reserves by purchasing financial assets .
but inflation - which rapid money @-@ supply expansion inevitably fuels - has so far remained subdued , at roughly 2 % , because banks are not using their swelling reserves to expand credit and increase liquidity .
while this is keeping price volatility in check , it is also hindering employment growth .
rather than changing its approach , however , the Fed has responded to slow employment growth by launching additional rounds of QE .
apparently , its rationale is that if expanding reserves by more than $ 2 trillion has not produced the desired results , adding $ 85 billion more monthly - another $ 1 trillion this year - might do the trick .
America &apos;s central bankers need not search far to find out why QE is not working ; evidence is published regularly for anyone to see .
during QE2 ( from November 2010 to July 2011 ) , the Fed added a total of $ 557.9 billion to reserves , and excess reserves grew by $ 546.5 billion .
that means that banks circulated only 2 % of QE2 &quot; s contribution , leaving the rest idle .
similarly , since QE3 was launched last September , total bank reserves have grown by $ 244.1 billion , and excess reserves by $ 239.4 billion - meaning that 99 % of the funds remain idle .
given that banks earn 0.25 % in interest on their reserve accounts , but pay very low - indeed , near @-@ zero - interest to their depositors , they might choose to leave the money idle , drawing risk @-@ free interest , rather than circulate it through the economy .
at current interest rates , banks lend to the government , large stable corporations , and commercial real @-@ estate dealers ; they do not extend credit to riskier borrowers , like start @-@ up companies or first @-@ time home buyers .
while speculators and bankers profit from the decline in interest rates that accompanies the Fed &apos;s asset purchases , the intended monetary and credit stimulus is absent .
at some point , the Fed must realize that its current policy is not working .
but developing a more effective alternative requires an understanding of the US economy &apos;s actual problems - something that the Fed also seems to lack .
indeed , Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke often says that his goal is to prevent another Great Depression , even though the Fed addressed that risk effectively in 2008 .
the US economy has not responded to the Fed &apos;s monetary expansion , because America &apos;s biggest problems are not liquidity problems .
as every economics student learns early on , monetary policy cannot fix problems in the real economy ; only policy changes affecting the real economy can .
the Fed should relearn that lesson .
one major problem , insufficient investment , is rooted in President Barack Obama &apos;s effort to increase the tax paid by those whose annual incomes exceed $ 250,000 and , more recently , in his proposal to cap retirement entitlements .
while such proposals have been met with opposition , Obama cannot be expected to sign a deficit @-@ reduction bill that does not include more revenue .
as long as that revenue &apos;s sources , and the future effects of new regulations , remain uncertain , those whom the policies would most harm - the country &apos;s largest savers - are unlikely to invest .
likewise , Obama &apos;s health @-@ care reform , the Affordable Care Act , has hampered employment growth , as businesses reduce their hiring and cut workers &quot; hours to shelter themselves from increased labor costs ( estimates of the rise vary ) .
meanwhile , the faltering European economy and slowing GDP growth in China and elsewhere are impeding export demand .
while subdued liquidity and credit growth are delaying the inflationary impact of the Fed &apos;s determination to expand banks &quot; already @-@ massive reserves , America cannot escape inflation forever .
the reserves that the Fed - and almost all other major central banks - are building will eventually be used .
Shinzo Abe &apos;s Monetary @-@ Policy Delusions
new HAVEN - The politicization of central banking continues unabated .
the resurrection of Shinzo Abe and Japan &apos;s Liberal Democratic Party - pillars of the political system that has left the Japanese economy mired in two lost decades and counting - is just the latest case in point .
Japan &apos;s recent election hinged critically on Abe &apos;s views of the Bank of Japan &apos;s monetary policy stance .
he argued that a timid BOJ should learn from its more aggressive counterparts , the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank .
just as the Fed and the ECB have apparently saved the day through their unconventional and aggressive quantitative easing ( QE ) , goes the argument , Abe believes it is now time for the BOJ to do the same .
it certainly looks as if he will get his way .
with BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa &apos;s term ending in April , Abe will be able to select a successor - and two deputy governors as well - to do his bidding .
but will it work ?
while experimental monetary policy is now widely accepted as standard operating procedure in today &apos;s post @-@ crisis era , its efficacy is dubious .
nearly four years after the world hit bottom in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , QE &apos;s impact has been strikingly asymmetric .
while massive liquidity injections were effective in unfreezing credit markets and arrested the worst of the crisis - witness the role of the Fed &apos;s first round of QE in 2009 @-@ 2010 - subsequent efforts have not sparked anything close to a normal cyclical recovery .
the reason is not hard to fathom .
hobbled by severe damage to private and public @-@ sector balance sheets , and with policy interest rates at or near zero , post @-@ bubble economies have been mired in a classic &quot; liquidity trap . &quot;
they are more focused on paying down massive debt overhangs built up before the crisis than on assuming new debt and boosting aggregate demand .
the sad case of the American consumer is a classic example of how this plays out .
in the years leading up to the crisis , two bubbles - property and credit - fueled a record @-@ high personal @-@ consumption binge .
when the bubbles burst , households understandably became fixated on balance @-@ sheet repair - namely , paying down debt and rebuilding personal savings , rather than resuming excessive spending habits .
indeed , notwithstanding an unprecedented post @-@ crisis tripling of Fed assets to roughly $ 3 trillion - probably on their way to $ 4 trillion over the next year - US consumers have pulled back as never before .
in the 19 quarters since the start of 2008 , annualized growth of inflation @-@ adjusted consumer spending has averaged just 0.7 % - almost three percentage points below the 3.6 % trend increases recorded in the 11 years ending in 2006 .
nor does the ECB have reason to be gratified with its strain of quantitative easing .
despite a doubling of its balance sheet , to a little more than € 3 trillion ( $ 4 trillion ) , Europe has slipped back into recession for the second time in four years .
not only is QE &apos;s ability to jumpstart crisis @-@ torn , balance @-@ sheet @-@ constrained economies limited ; it also runs the important risk of blurring the distinction between monetary and fiscal policy .
central banks that buy sovereign debt issued by fiscal authorities offset market @-@ imposed discipline on borrowing costs , effectively subsidizing public @-@ sector profligacy .
unfortunately , it appears that Japan has forgotten many of its own lessons - especially the BOJ &apos;s disappointing experience with zero interest rates and QE in the early 2000 &quot; s .
but it has also lost sight of the 1990 &quot; s - the first of its so @-@ called lost decades - when the authorities did all they could to prolong the life of insolvent banks and many nonfinancial corporations .
zombie @-@ like companies were kept on artificial life @-@ support in the false hope that time alone would revive them .
it was not until late in the decade , when the banking sector was reorganized and corporate restructuring was encouraged , that Japan made progress on the long , arduous road of balance @-@ sheet repair and structural transformation .
US authorities have succumbed to the same Japanese @-@ like temptations .
from quantitative easing to record @-@ high federal budget deficits to unprecedented bailouts , they have done everything in their power to mask the pain of balance @-@ sheet repair and structural adjustment .
as a result , America has created its own generation of zombies - in this case , zombie consumers .
like Japan , America &apos;s post @-@ bubble healing has been limited - even in the face of the Fed &apos;s outsize liquidity injections .
household debt stood at 112 % of income in the third quarter of 2012 - down from record highs in 2006 , but still nearly 40 percentage points above the 75 % norm of the last three decades of the twentieth century .
similarly , the personal @-@ saving rate , at just 3.5 % in the four months ending in November 2012 , was less than half the 7.9 % average of 1970 @-@ 99 .
the same is true of Europe . the ECB &apos;s über @-@ aggressive actions have achieved little in the way of bringing about long @-@ awaited structural transformation in the region .
crisis @-@ torn peripheral European economies still suffer from unsustainable debt loads and serious productivity and competitiveness problems .
and a fragmented European banking system remains one of the weakest links in the regional daisy chain .
is this the &quot; cure &quot; that Abe really wants for Japan ?
the last thing that the Japanese economy needs at this point is backsliding on structural reforms .
yet , by forcing the BOJ to follow in the misdirected footsteps of the Fed and the ECB , that is precisely the risk that Abe and Japan are facing .
massive liquidity injections carried out by the world &apos;s major central banks - the Fed , the ECB , and the BOJ - are neither achieving traction in their respective real economies , nor facilitating balance @-@ sheet repair and structural change .
that leaves a huge sum of excess liquidity sloshing around in global asset markets .
where it goes , the next crisis is inevitably doomed to follow .
why Remember Pearl Harbor ?
new YORK - December 7 marks the 67th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor .
over the years , &quot; the day of infamy &quot; has become a classic reference point for galvanizing patriotic sentiment in America .
in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attack , for example , analogies to Pearl Harbor were made frequently .
but despite its central place in America &apos;s collective memory , Pearl Harbor remains little understood .
why did Japan initiate such a seemingly self @-@ destructive war in the first place ?
aside from lessons that Japan must learn from its momentous decision , is there something to be learned by the United States as well ?
the decision to attack Pearl Harbor was reached after five months of deliberations that included numerous official conferences .
it was a gradual process in which more sympathetic , albeit firm , US engagement might have helped sway Japan in a different direction .
in fact , Japanese government opinion was so divided that it is surprising that it was able to unite in the end .
many in the Japanese Army initially regarded the Soviet Union as the main threat facing the country .
others saw the US as the primary enemy .
some were concerned with more abstract , ideological enemies , such as Communism and &quot; Americanism , &quot; while there were also voices highlighting the menace of the &quot; white race &quot; ( including Japan &apos;s allies , Germany and Italy ) against the &quot; yellow race . &quot;
then there were those who preferred not to fight any enemy at all , particularly the US , whose long @-@ term war @-@ making power , the government knew , far surpassed Japan &apos;s own .
the tactical mastermind of the Pearl Harbor operation , Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , was one of them .
over the course of the summer of 1941 , events slowly tilted Japan towards the possibility of war with the West .
but Pearl Harbor was in no way inevitable .
Germany &apos;s attack on the Soviet Union compelled Japan in July 1941 to prepare a plan of attack .
although it made clear Japan &apos;s desire to take advantage of the European conflict and gain a foothold in the European colonies in Southeast Asia , the plan was not clear about who constituted Japan &apos;s true enemy .
Japan &apos;s military thrust into Southeast Asia led President Franklin Delano Roosevelt &apos;s administration to impose sanctions .
the US froze Japanese assets , an example followed by Britain and the Dutch East Indies .
when Japan responded by taking over southern French Indochina , the US retaliated by imposing an embargo on oil exports to Japan .
rather than telling Japan that the US was determined to search for a diplomatic solution , America &apos;s categorical reaction confirmed it to the Japanese as an arrogant and conceited enemy .
moreover , by transferring its Pacific Fleet from San Diego to Pearl Harbor , the US encouraged the Japanese understanding that the US fully anticipated war with Japan .
world War II in the Pacific finally came about for many different reasons .
but it was , above all , the sense of encirclement and humiliation that united the deeply divided Japanese government .
feeling defeated by a series of failed approaches to the US , including an overture to hold direct talks with Roosevelt , Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe resigned on October 16 , making hard @-@ line Army Minister Hideki Tōjō his successor .
the high @-@ handed tone of the Hull Note of November 26 , demanding Japan &apos;s withdrawal of all its troops from China , was a final blow to the moderates in Japan &apos;s government , who still hoped for diplomatic negotiations .
by this time , many policymakers were convinced that the US was not ready to hear them out .
it was ultimately in the name of saving Asia for all Asians from what was regarded as Western arrogance that the government united to wage war .
on December 1 , it was decided that the war would commence in six days .
there were legitimate historical reasons for Japan to feel humiliated on the eve of war .
the gunboat diplomacy that resulted in the opening of Japan and unequal treaties in the mid @-@ 19th century was but a beginning .
more immediately , the Great Depression and the subsequent compartmentalization of the world into economic blocs also worked to the advantage of the already powerful .
coupled with the economic hardship of the interwar years were instances of racial prejudice in the US that aimed at preventing Japanese immigration .
United by this long @-@ simmering and humiliating sense of exclusion , Japanese policymakers , whatever their differences , stumbled toward the December 1 decision to go to war .
with almost 70 years of hindsight , Pearl Harbor should offer some lessons for US foreign policy today .
despite obvious differences between Pearl Harbor and recent Islamist terrorist tactics , they show the common desire of self @-@ proclaimed Davids to topple their Goliaths in a clearly lop @-@ sided battle .
these Davids depend on Western technologies to overcome imbalances of power , and are driven by a sense of real or imagined humiliation .
but no matter how strong and historically justified such grievances may be those who resort to murderous tactics must be condemned .
however , high @-@ handedness and tough talk alone are an inadequate response , for this approach further humiliates those who already feel humiliated , and alienates those who might otherwise proffer a more moderate voice .
diplomacy no longer works with terrorism , but it can help to prevent it by dealing carefully with potentially hostile states .
with global expectations mounting for a fresh start in US foreign policy , it is vital not just to remember , but to understand the attack on Pearl Harbor .
why Obamacare Survived
Cambridge - Since the United States &quot; Affordable Care Act ( ACA ) - or &quot; Obamacare &quot; - was enacted in 2010 , Republicans have been promising to &quot; repeal and replace &quot; it .
when the 2016 presidential and congressional elections delivered all three branches of the US government to the party , the time to fulfill that promise seemed to have arrived .
yet the anti @-@ Obamacare crusade has just been dealt a crushing blow , owing to the refusal of some Republican senators to vote for the replacement legislation .
Republicans blame their failure on the Democrats &quot; refusal to cooperate .
but why should the Democrats help to dismantle their biggest legislative achievement of the last decade ( if not longer ) ?
the major flaws in Obamacare are not , as has been argued , unintended consequences of a poorly designed policy , which thus must be replaced ; instead , they stem from Republican demands .
in any case , Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress , so they don &apos;t actually need the Democrats &quot; support to pass legislation .
likewise , President Donald Trump &apos;s unprecedented lack of experience and general incompetence cannot be at fault , as he isn &apos;t indispensible to the repeal and replace process .
the truth is that the blame belongs squarely on the shoulders of congressional Republicans .
since 2010 , they voted more than 50 times to repeal the ACA .
those votes may have been merely symbolic , given Obama &apos;s veto power ; nonetheless , the striking fact remains that the Republicans never bothered to try to formulate an alternative in the event that one of their own would one day become president .
in fact , they couldn &apos;t formulate a workable alternative to Obamacare , because some within their ranks refuse to accept the basic laws of arithmetic .
according to the estimates produced by the Congressional Budget Office , which has a very good track record , the Republicans &quot; proposed health @-@ care legislation would have caused more than 20 million Americans to lose insurance coverage .
but many Republicans continue to insist that they can somehow slash spending and eliminate rules and requirements , including the &quot; individual mandate &quot; ( the requirement that all Americans have health insurance ) that underpins Obamacare , without affecting current coverage levels .
of course , there are Republicans who acknowledge the facts .
some support repeal and replace anyway : Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky , for example , is a relatively consistent libertarian who believes that the benefits of minimizing the government &apos;s role in health care somehow outweigh the costs to lower- and middle @-@ income working Americans .
others recognize that the costs are unacceptable - indeed , that is why the Republican @-@ proposed replacement has just been rejected - but have been unable to put forward any credible alternative .
logically , there should be a third group of moderate Republicans who acknowledge the arithmetic , find it unacceptable , and commit either to reforming Obamacare or developing some other realistic plan that can deliver better health insurance to more Americans .
unfortunately , there is nobody left in this category , except perhaps Senator Susan Collins of Maine .
but there is another , deeper reason why the Republicans cannot come up with an alternative to Obamacare : the ACA is based firmly on their own ideas .
for example , the individual mandate that they now decry was originally developed by conservative think tanks seeking to devise a workable system of national health insurance with the smallest possible role for the government .
it was the centerpiece of Massachusetts &quot; health @-@ care reform signed by Mitt Romney in 2006 , when he was the state &apos;s governor .
the individual mandate is essential to barring insurance companies from discriminating against those with pre @-@ existing conditions - a provision that even Obamacare &apos;s opponents want to keep .
it is not financially feasible for private insurance companies to insure people who are already sick or at high risk , if those who are still healthy are not also in the pool .
this does not mean that the US needs to go to the extreme of a full @-@ on socialized health @-@ care system , whereby the government directly provides health care to all ( though the British are certainly attached to their National Health Service ) .
and , indeed , nobody in the US is calling for that .
what some - most vocally , Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders - have proposed is a single @-@ payer system .
in Canada , such a system of government insurance and private provision of services delivers strong health outcomes at a fraction of the cost of the US system .
yet , while a substantial share of Americans may support such a system , a single @-@ payer program would face strong resistance from three powerful groups : the insurance industry , consumers who are happy with their current employer @-@ paid plans , and Republicans in general .
but the system many Republicans tout - a scheme based fully on &quot; personal responsibility &quot; - is not feasible .
the system the US had before Obamacare did not meet that standard , as the uninsured imposed costs not just on themselves , but also on other Americans .
those without insurance are more likely to experience conditions like obesity and addiction , and to let their health deteriorate before seeking medical attention .
before Obamacare , hospitals would simply pass the higher costs of treating them on to other patients .
a system of genuine personal responsibility would require that the medical profession not provide care that it feels ethically obliged to provide .
but I have yet to meet a free @-@ market conservative who would truly favor a new federal law requiring ambulances to leave accident victims by the side of the road unless they can show proof of insurance .
the solution to America &apos;s health @-@ care woes lies somewhere between socialized medicine and laissez @-@ faire .
but there is no question that it must include something like the three legs of the Obamacare &quot; stool &quot; : the individual mandate , protection for those with pre @-@ existing conditions , and a means to pay for it all .
though some Republicans pretend otherwise , there is simply no solution that decreases the role of government without increasing the ranks of the uninsured - and thus raising total health @-@ care costs .
America &apos;s Global Election
new YORK - Most people around the world will not be able to vote in the United States &apos;s upcoming presidential election , even though they have a great deal at stake in the result .
overwhelmingly , non @-@ US citizens favor Barack Obama &apos;s re @-@ election over a victory for his challenger , Mitt Romney .
there are good reasons for this .
in terms of the economy , the effects of Romney &apos;s policies in creating a more unequal and divided society would not be directly felt abroad .
but , in the past , for better and for worse , others have often followed America &apos;s example .
many governments quickly subscribed to Ronald Reagan &apos;s mantra of deregulated markets - policies that eventually brought about the worst global recession since the 1930 &quot; s .
other countries that followed America &apos;s lead have experienced growing inequality - more money at the top , more poverty at the bottom , and a weaker middle class .
Romney &apos;s proposed contractionary policies - the attempt to reduce deficits prematurely , while the US economy is still frail - will almost surely weaken America &apos;s already anemic growth , and , if the euro crisis worsens , it could bring on another recession .
at that point , with US demand shrinking , the rest of the world would indeed feel the economic effects of a Romney presidency quite directly .
that raises the question of globalization , which entails concerted action on many fronts by the international community .
but what is required with regard to trade , finance , climate change , and a host other areas is not being done .
many people attribute these failures partly to an absence of American leadership .
but , while Romney may summon bravado and strong rhetoric , other world leaders would be unlikely to follow him , owing to the belief ( correct in my judgment ) that he would take the US - and them - in the wrong direction .
American &quot; exceptionalism &quot; may sell well at home , but it does poorly abroad .
President George W. Bush &apos;s Iraq war - arguably a violation of international law - showed that though America spends almost as much on defense as the rest of the world combined , it could not pacify a country with less than 10 % of its population and less than 1 % of its GDP .
moreover , it turned out that US @-@ style capitalism was neither efficient nor stable .
with most Americans &quot; incomes stagnating for a decade and a half , it was clear that the US economic model was not delivering for most citizens , whatever official GDP data said .
indeed , the model blew up even before Bush left office .
together with the abuses of human rights under his administration , the Great Recession - the predictable ( and predicted ) consequence of his economic policies - did as much to weaken America &apos;s soft power as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan did to weaken the credibility of its military power .
in terms of values - namely , the values of Romney and his running mate , Paul Ryan - things are not much better .
for example , every other advanced country recognizes the right to accessible health care , and Obama &apos;s Affordable Care Act represents a significant step toward that goal .
but Romney has criticized this effort , and has offered nothing in its place .
America now has the distinction of being among the advanced countries that afford the least equality of opportunity to their citizens .
and Romney &apos;s drastic budget cutbacks , targeted at the poor and middle class , would further impede social mobility .
at the same time , he would expand the military , spending more money on weapons that do not work against enemies that do not exist , enriching defense contractors like Halliburton at the expense of desperately needed public investment in infrastructure and education .
while Bush is not on the ballot , Romney has not really distanced himself from the Bush administration &apos;s policies .
on the contrary , his campaign has featured the same advisers , the same devotion to higher military spending , the same belief that tax cuts for the rich are the solution to every economic problem , and the same fuzzy budget math .
consider , for example , the three issues that are at the center of the global agenda mentioned earlier : climate change , financial regulation , and trade .
Romney has been silent on the first , and many in his party are &quot; climate deniers . &quot;
the world cannot expect genuine leadership from Romney there .
as for financial regulation , while the recent crisis has highlighted the need for stricter rules , agreement on many issues has proven to be elusive , partly because the Obama administration is too close to the financial sector .
with Romney , though , there would be no distance at all : metaphorically speaking , he is the financial sector .
one financial issue on which there is global agreement is the need to close down offshore bank havens , which exist mainly for purposes of tax evasion and avoidance , money laundering , and corruption .
money does not go to the Cayman Islands because sunshine makes it grow faster ; this money thrives on the absence of sunshine .
but , with Romney unapologetic about his own use of Cayman banks , we are unlikely to see progress even in this area .
on trade , Romney promises to launch a trade war with China , and to declare it a currency manipulator on Day One - a promise that gives him little wiggle room .
he refuses to note the renminbi &apos;s large real appreciation in recent years , or to acknowledge that , while changes in China &apos;s exchange rate may affect the bilateral trade deficit , what matters is America &apos;s multilateral trade deficit .
a stronger renminbi would simply mean a switch in the US from China to lower @-@ cost producers of textiles , apparel , and other goods .
the irony - again lost on Romney - is that other countries are accusing the US of currency manipulation .
after all , one of the main benefits of the Federal Reserve &apos;s policy of &quot; quantitative easing &quot; - perhaps the only channel with a significant effect on the real economy - derives from the depreciation of the US dollar .
the world has a lot riding on America &apos;s election .
unfortunately , most people who will be affected by it - almost the entire world - will have no influence on the outcome .
the Battle Cry of the Non @-@ oppressed
Tel AVIV - Nobody should be surprised that Scotland &apos;s recent referendum on independence left the United Kingdom intact .
in the past , regions or communities have achieved statehood almost exclusively after a struggle against colonial subjection and oppression , galvanized by an appeal to a distinctive religious , cultural , or ethnic identity .
complaints about economic dynamics , social policies , or governance inefficiencies - the basis of Scotland &apos;s &quot; yes &quot; campaign - are not the cris de coeur of a successful independence movement .
that is bad news for secessionists elsewhere in the West .
of course , Scotland &apos;s technocratic nationalism made sense .
as the movement &apos;s leader , Alex Salmond , acknowledged in a 2012 consultation document , &quot; Scotland is not oppressed and we have no need to be liberated . &quot;
the struggle for independence , he explained , was aimed at creating the kind of efficient administrative and economic structures that would enable Scotland to reach its potential .
the &quot; yes &quot; campaign hoped to win supporters with a utopian vision of an independent Scotland that included European Union and NATO membership ; a currency union with England , but no fiscal union ; improved public services and social benefits ; and lower taxes .
in other words , Scotland would have everything it has now , only better , and on its own terms .
this vision was undoubtedly appealing to many Scots .
but it proved significantly less compelling than the economic doomsday scenarios advanced by its unionist opponents , including former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , former World Bank President Robert Zoellick , and Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne .
in other words , many people &apos;s votes were driven by risk aversion , fear , and intimidation , rather than hope , passion , or deep emotional attachment to a common identity .
this contrasts sharply with the motivations espoused by Scotland &apos;s nobles in the fourteenth century , when they succeeded in preserving their country &apos;s independence from English rule .
&quot; it is in truth not for glory , nor riches , nor honors that we are fighting , &quot; they declared , &quot; but for freedom alone , which no honest man gives up but with life itself . &quot;
in fact , the &quot; no &quot; campaign &apos;s victory might have been even more resounding if the Westminster establishment &apos;s desperate , last @-@ minute offer to grant Scotland more powers on taxation , spending , and welfare had been included as an option in the ballot .
national movements driven by a historical mission or an uncompromising quest to assert group identity against a dominant power normally do not succumb to economic considerations and last @-@ minute economic bait .
it was none other than the founder of the Zionist fundamentalist right , Ze &apos;ev Jabotinsky , who warned in 1924 against &quot; the naive assumption that the aspiration of the Palestinians ... will be paralyzed by such means as subsidies , economic advantages , or bribery . &quot;
recognizing that their &quot; natural patriotism is pure and noble , &quot; he knew that they could not be &quot; bought off . &quot;
now , Salmond is probably re @-@ thinking his avoidance of nativist identity politics .
what Edmund Burke defined as a group &apos;s attachment to &quot; the inns and resting places of the human spirit &quot; - that is , ethnic , religious , and community ties - would have been a much more powerful mobilizing force for an independence movement .
the &quot; yes &quot; campaigners would not have had to look far for inspiration .
James Joyce - himself not devoid of traces of Irish nationalism - wrote that &quot; nationality , language , &#91; and &#93; religion &quot; are &quot; the nets &quot; into which &quot; a man is born . &quot;
similarly , George Orwell distinguished between Celtic nationalism and Anglophobia , stating that the former is belief &quot; in the past and future greatness of the Celtic peoples . &quot;
true , Scotland &apos;s great minds in the age of Enlightenment , such as David Hume , Adam Smith , and even the national poet , Robert Burns , were all fervent advocates of &quot; Britishness , &quot; whatever that might mean today .
yet an identity @-@ based campaign could have resorted to the heritage of the Scottish Renaissance of the mid @-@ twentieth century or to the Celtic Revival and Celtic Twilight movements , which awakened a spirit of cultural nationalism among Scots in the late nineteenth century .
in the run @-@ up to the referendum , Scotland &apos;s independence movement became an important point of reference for Catalans and Basques in Spain , the Flemish in Belgium , the Veneto and South Tyrol regions in Italy , Corsicans and Bretons in France , and the secessionists of Quebec .
all hoped that Scotland would pave the way for the peaceful breakup of their own states .
with the defeat of Scotland &apos;s independence movement - not to mention Québécois voters &quot; stunning rejection of the province &apos;s largest separatist party in last April &apos;s election - that hope may be waning .
and with good reason .
there is little historical precedent for the peaceful breakup of a state , with an exception like Czechoslovakia &apos;s consensual split in 1993 occurring in unique circumstances .
a state is far more likely to go to war to defend its unity .
the United States and Spain did it in their civil wars , and today &apos;s Spain would go to the outer limits of its capacity to prevent a Catalan or Basque referendum , let alone independence .
nationalist groups in Western democracies are not subjugated people .
theirs is the nationalism of free , liberated people , who can expect the most generous devolution deals possible to protect their singular legacies and address their grievances .
and perhaps that is why federal arrangements like those in Australia and Canada - essentially what Westminster grudgingly offered Scotland - could be their best option .
long Live China &apos;s Slowdown
new HAVEN - At 7.7 % , China &apos;s annual GDP growth in the first quarter of this year was slower than many expected .
while the data were hardly devastating relative to a consensus forecast of 8.2 % , many ( including me ) expected a second consecutive quarterly rebound from the slowdown that appeared to have ended in the third quarter of 2012 .
China doubters around the world were quick to pounce on the number , expressing fears of a stall , or even a dreaded double dip .
but slower GDP growth is actually good for China , provided that it reflects the long @-@ awaited structural transformation of the world &apos;s most dynamic economy .
the broad outlines of this transformation are well known - a shift from export- and investment @-@ led growth to an economic structure that draws greater support from domestic private consumption .
less well known is that a rebalanced China should have a slower growth rate - the first hints of which may now be evident .
a rebalanced China can grow more slowly for one simple reason : by drawing increased support from services @-@ led consumer demand , China &apos;s new model will embrace a more labor @-@ intensive growth recipe .
the numbers seem to bear that out .
China &apos;s services sector requires about 35 % more jobs per unit of GDP than do manufacturing and construction - the primary drivers of the old model .
that number has potentially huge implications , because it means that China could grow at an annual rate in the 7 @-@ 8 % range and still achieve its objectives with respect to employment and poverty reduction .
China has struggled to attain these goals with anything less than 10 % growth , because the old model was not generating enough jobs per unit of output .
as Chinese manufacturing moved up the value chain , firms increasingly replaced workers with machines embodying the latest technologies .
as a result , its economic model spawned a labor @-@ saving , capital @-@ intensive growth dynamic .
on one level , that made sense .
capital @-@ labor substitution is at the heart of modern productivity strategies for manufacturing @-@ based economies .
but it left China in a deepening hole : increasingly deficient in jobs per unit of output , it needed more units of output to absorb its surplus labor .
ultimately , that became more of a problem than a solution .
the old manufacturing model , which fueled an unprecedented 20 @-@ fold increase in per capita income relative to the early 1990 &quot; s , also sowed the seeds of excessive resource consumption and environmental degradation .
services @-@ led growth is , in many ways , the antidote to the &quot; unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and ultimately unsustainable &quot; growth model that former Premier Wen Jiabao &apos;s famously criticized in 2007 .
yet services offer more than just a labor @-@ intensive growth path .
compared to manufacturing , they have much smaller resource and carbon footprints .
a services @-@ led model provides China with an alternative , environmentally friendlier , and ultimately more sustainable economic structure .
it is premature , of course , to conclude that a services @-@ led transformation to slower growth is now at hand .
the latest data hint at such a possibility , with the tertiary sector ( services ) expanding at an 8.3 % annual rate in the first quarter of this year - the third consecutive quarter of acceleration and a half @-@ percentage point faster than the 7.8 % first @-@ quarter gain recorded by the secondary sector ( manufacturing and construction ) .
but it will take more than a few quarters of mildly encouraging data to validate such an important shift in the Chinese economy &apos;s underlying structure .
not surprisingly , China skeptics are putting a different spin on the latest growth numbers .
fears of a shadow @-@ bank @-@ induced credit bubble now top the worry list , reinforcing longstanding concerns that China may succumb to the dreaded &quot; middle @-@ income trap &quot; - a sustained growth slowdown that has ensnared most high @-@ growth emerging economies at the juncture that China has now reached .
China is hardly immune to such a possibility .
but it is unlikely to occur if China can carry out the services @-@ led pro @-@ consumption rebalancing that remains the core strategic initiative of its current ( 12th ) Five @-@ Year Plan .
invariably , the middle @-@ income trap afflicts those emerging economies that cling to early @-@ stage development models for too long .
for China , the risk will be highest if it sticks with the timeworn recipe of unbalanced manufacturing- and construction @-@ led growth , which has created such serious sustainability problems .
if China fails to rebalance , weak external demand from a crisis @-@ battered developed world will continue to hobble its export machine , forcing it to up the ante on a credit- and investment @-@ led growth model - in effect , doubling down on resource @-@ intensive and environmentally damaging growth .
but I remain hopeful that China &apos;s new leadership team will move quickly to implement its new model .
there are no viable alternatives .
financial markets , as well as growth @-@ starved developed economies , are not thrilled with the natural rhythm of slower growth that a rebalanced Chinese economy is likely to experience .
resource industries - indeed , resource @-@ based economies like Australia , Canada , Brazil , and Russia - have become addicted to China &apos;s old strain of unsustainable hyper @-@ growth .
yet China knows that it is time to break that dangerous habit .
the United States is likely to have a different problem with consumer @-@ led growth in China .
after all , higher private consumption implies an end to China &apos;s surplus saving - and thus to the seemingly open @-@ ended recycling of that surplus into dollar @-@ based assets such as US Treasury bills .
who will then fund America &apos;s budget deficit - and on what terms ?
just as China must embrace slower growth as a natural consequence of its rebalancing imperative , the rest of the world will need to figure out how to cope when it does .
why Small booms Cause Big busts
Berkeley - As bubbles go , it was not a very big one .
from 2002 to 2006 , the share of the American economy devoted to residential construction rose by 1.2 percentage points of GDP above its previous trend value , before plunging as the United States entered the greatest economic crisis in nearly a century .
according to my rough calculations , the excess investment in the housing sector during this period totaled some $ 500 billion - by any measure a tiny fraction of the world economy at the time of the crash .
the resulting damage , however , has been enormous .
the economies of Europe and North America are roughly 6 % smaller than we would have expected them to be had there been no crisis .
in other words , a relatively small amount of overinvestment is responsible for some $ 1.8 trillion in lost production every year .
given that the gap shows no signs of closing , and accounting for expected growth rates and equity returns , I estimate that the total loss to production will eventually reach nearly $ 3 quadrillion .
for each dollar of overinvestment in the housing market , the world economy will have suffered $ 6,000 in losses .
how can this be ?
it is important to note that not all recessions cause so much pain .
financial blows in 1987 , 1991 , 1997 , 1998 , and 2001 ( when some $ 4 trillion of excess investment was lost when the dot @-@ com bubble burst ) had little impact on the broader real economy .
the reason why things were different this time can be found in a recently published paper by Òscar Jordà , Moritz Schularick , and Alan M. Taylor .
large credit booms , the authors show , can greatly worsen the damage caused by the collapse of an asset bubble .
historically , when a recession is caused by the collapse of an asset bubble that was not fueled by a credit boom , the economy is roughly 1 @-@ 1.5 % below what it otherwise would have been five years after the start of the downturn .
when a credit boom is involved , however , the damage is significantly greater .
when the bubble is in equity prices , the economy performs 4 % below par , on average , after five years - and as much as 9 % below par when the bubble is in the housing market .
given these findings , it is clear that the distress experienced since the beginning of the economic crisis is not far out of line with historical experience .
for many economists , recessions are an inevitable part of the business cycle - the bust that necessarily follows , like a hangover , from any boom . John Maynard Keynes , however , had little time for this view .
&quot; it seems an extraordinary imbecility that this wonderful outburst of productive energy should be the prelude to impoverishment and depression , &quot; Keynes wrote in 1931 , after the boom years of the 1920s had given way to the Great Depression .
&quot; I find the explanation of the current business losses , of the reduction in output , and of the unemployment which necessarily ensues on this not in the high level of investment which was proceeding up to the spring of 1929 , but in the subsequent cessation of this investment . &quot;
a few years later , Keynes proposed a fix to the problem .
in The General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money , Keynes explained how booms are created when &quot; investments which will in fact yield , say , 2 % in conditions of full employment are made in the expectation of a yield of , say , 6 % and are valued accordingly . &quot; in a recession , the problem is flipped .
investments that would yield 2 % are &quot; expected to yield less than nothing . &quot;
the result is a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy , in which widespread unemployment does indeed drive the returns of those investments below zero .
&quot; we reach a condition where there is a shortage of houses , &quot; Keynes wrote , &quot; but where nevertheless no one can afford to live in the houses that there are . &quot;
his solution was simple : &quot; the right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi @-@ slump ; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi @-@ boom . &quot;
for Keynes , the underlying problem was a failure of the economy &apos;s credit channels .
the financial reaction to the collapse of a bubble and the resulting wave of bankruptcies drives the natural rate of interest below zero , even though there are still many ways to put people productively to work .
today , we recognize that clogged credit channels can cause an economic downturn .
there are three commonly proposed responses .
the first is expansionary fiscal policies , with governments taking up the slack in the face of weak private investment .
the second is a higher inflation target , giving central banks more room to respond to financial shocks .
and the third is tight restrictions on debt and leverage , especially in the housing market , in order to prevent a credit @-@ fueled price bubble from forming .
to these solutions , Keynes would have added a fourth , one known to us today as the &quot; Greenspan put &quot; - using monetary policy to validate the asset prices reached at the height of the bubble .
unfortunately , in a world in which fiscal austerity appears to exert a mesmerizing hold over politicians , and in which a 2 % inflation target seems set in stone , our policy options are rather limited .
and that , ultimately , is how a relatively small boom can lead to such a large bust .
rebalancing the State &apos;s Balance Sheet
Milan - Until recently , relatively little attention was paid to states &quot; balance sheets .
measurement and reporting were neglected .
even today , states &quot; liabilities receive considerable attention , while their asset sides receive significantly less .
in an earlier era , states owned substantial industrial assets .
this &quot; commanding heights of the economy &quot; model was rejected largely because it seriously under @-@ performed , especially when state @-@ owned sectors were protected from competition ( as was the norm ) .
efficiency declined .
but , more important , the absence of entry and exit by firms , a key ingredient of innovation , caused dynamism to suffer and losses to grow over time .
the model &apos;s shortcomings led to privatization in many developed and developing countries .
in Europe , privatization was viewed as a key step in the integration process .
the theory , in Europe and elsewhere , was that states could not be impartial owners of industrial assets .
through regulation , public procurement , and hidden subsidies , they would favor their own assets .
of course , state ownership is not the only way to impede efficiency and dynamism .
regulations in a range of countries , from Japan to Italy , create sectors that are sheltered from competition , with detrimental effects on productivity .
this pattern is particularly pronounced in the non @-@ tradable sectors ( which account for two @-@ thirds of the economy ) , where the discipline of foreign competition is absent by definition .
even here , foreign @-@ based domestic competitors could improve performance .
it is important that more attention is now paid to public liabilities - not only growing sovereign debt , but also larger , non @-@ debt liabilities embedded in social @-@ insurance programs .
a combination of defective growth models , rising longevity , and unanticipated increases in costs ( such as health care in America ) have caused these longer @-@ term liabilities to explode .
reining in debt and other liabilities has substantially reduced governments &quot; scope for sustaining demand in the face of severe negative shocks , thus reducing their ability to buy time for structural adjustment in the private sector .
for now , investment in a shift to a sustainable growth and employment pattern has been crowded out .
shifting consumption to investment via tax increases is possible , but too problematic politically , with the burden @-@ sharing issue usually leading to impasse and inaction .
meanwhile , the asset side of states &quot; balance sheets remains largely invisible . States own land , mineral rights , and infrastructure .
some have sovereign wealth funds .
many have public pension funds of substantial magnitude , consisting of diversified portfolios of assets .
these assets are , in a sense , spoken for - there are claims on them in the form of liabilities , which have grown as expected risk @-@ adjusted returns on assets decline ; but they do represent a partial funding of public liabilities and are an element of resilience .
by contrast , in China , the asset side of the state balance sheet is very large : land , foreign @-@ currency reserves of $ 3.5 trillion , and around an 85 % stake in state @-@ owned enterprises that account for about 40 % of output .
this balance @-@ sheet configuration has helped China to respond to shocks and sustain high levels of public @-@ sector investment .
the liability side will expand as social insurance grows - but slowly , owing to a fear of underestimating the liabilities being created .
in the best case - without a sharp decline in financial assets accelerating an economic downturn , a sudden collapse of a defective growth model , or even rapid increases in liabilities associated with demographic shifts or health @-@ care technology - it might make sense to focus only on controlling liabilities .
but a best @-@ case scenario provides a poor policy framework in our imperfect world .
in fact , states are routinely called upon to deal with a wide range of market failures or limitations : unsustainable growth patterns and regulatory myopia ; distributional problems associated with the evolution of technology and globalization ; accelerating concentration of national income ; and major structural transitions associated with shocks and secular trends in technology and the global economy .
here is the dilemma : governments with substantial assets have flexibility and the capacity to act , but they can also mismanage their assets to the detriment of markets and economic dynamism .
in China , where the asset side of the balance sheet is large , the strategy of shrinking it via privatization has been largely rejected , at least for now .
the loss of resilience would be too great .
that leads to the challenge of effective management of public assets - management that promotes rather than impedes market efficiency and innovation .
here , what might be called the pension / sovereign @-@ wealth @-@ fund model - in which a public entity holds and manages a diversified portfolio of assets as a financial investor with appropriately specified duties and governance - seems to be the right way to go .
the asset side of the balance sheet is maintained in the aggregate , but the management of the assets , particularly the diversification of holdings , can be thought of as prudent and de facto privatized .
for developed countries , increasing resilience and flexibility over time by building public assets should be a long @-@ term priority .
periodic systemic risk affects entire economies and public finances , not only financial markets , and governments should be able to respond during periods of rapid structural change .
in practice , this means two things .
first , once a collective choice is made about the desired levels of social insurance , the implied liabilities should be fully funded over time .
the alternative is a poor intergenerational burden @-@ sharing choice .
second , governments , like individuals , households , and businesses , need to save for a rainy day .
that is all the more important in periods - like the current one - of rapid change , high volatility , and only partly predictable systemic instability .
why Support the TPP ?
Cambridge - Agreement among negotiators from 12 Pacific Rim countries on the Trans @-@ Pacific Partnership ( TPP ) represents a triumph over long odds .
tremendous political obstacles , both domestic and international , had to be overcome to conclude the deal .
and now critics of the TPP &apos;s ratification , particularly in the United States , should read the agreement with an open mind .
many of the issues surrounding the TPP have been framed , at least in US political terms , as left versus right .
the left &apos;s unremitting hostility to the deal - often on the grounds that the US Congress was kept in the dark about its content during negotiations - carried two dangers .
a worthwhile effort could have been blocked , or President Barack Obama &apos;s Democratic administration could have been compelled to be more generous to American corporations , in order to pick up needed votes from Republicans .
in fact , those concerned about labor rights and the environment risked hurting their own cause .
by seeming to say that they would not support the TPP under any conditions , Obama had little incentive to pursue their demands .
seen in this light , the TPP that has emerged is a pleasant surprise .
the agreement gives pharmaceutical firms , tobacco companies , and other corporations substantially less than they had asked for - so much so that US Senator Orrin hatch and some other Republicans now threaten to oppose ratification .
likewise , the deal gives environmentalists more than they had bothered to ask for .
perhaps some of these outcomes were the result of hard bargaining by other trading partners ( such as Australia ) .
regardless , the TPP &apos;s critics should now read the specifics that they have so long said they wanted to see and reconsider their opposition to the deal .
the most controversial issues in the US are those that are sometimes classified as &quot; deep integration , &quot; because they go beyond the traditional easing of trade tariffs and quotas .
the left &apos;s concerns about labor and the environment were accompanied by fears about excessive benefits for corporations : protection of the intellectual property of pharmaceutical and other companies , and the mechanisms used to settle disputes between investors and states .
so what , exactly , is in the finished TPP ?
among the environmental features , two stand out .
the agreement includes substantial steps to enforce the prohibitions contained in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) .
it also takes substantial steps to limit subsidies for fishing fleets - which in many countries waste taxpayer money and accelerate the depletion of marine life .
for the first time , apparently , these environmental measures will be backed up by trade sanctions .
I wish that certain environmental groups had devoted half as much time and energy ascertaining the potential for such good outcomes as they did to sweeping condemnations of the negotiating process .
the critics apparently were too busy to notice when the agreement on fishing subsidies was reached in Maui in July .
but it is not too late for environmentalists to get on board .
similarly , various provisions in the area of labor practices , particularly in Southeast Asia , are progressive .
these include measures to promote union rights in Vietnam and steps to crack down on human trafficking in Malaysia .
perhaps the greatest uncertainty concerned the extent to which big US corporations would get what they wanted in the areas of investor @-@ government dispute settlement and intellectual property protection .
the TPP &apos;s critics often neglected to acknowledge that international dispute @-@ settlement mechanisms could ever serve a valid purpose , or that some degree of patent protection is needed if pharmaceutical companies are to have sufficient incentive to invest in research and development .
there was , of course , a danger that such protections for corporations could go too far .
the dispute @-@ settlement provisions might have interfered unreasonably with member countries &quot; anti @-@ smoking campaigns , for example .
but , in the end , the tobacco companies did not get what they had been demanding ; Australia is now free to ban brand @-@ name logos on cigarette packs .
the TPP also sets other new safeguards against the misuse of the dispute @-@ settlement mechanism .
likewise , the intellectual property protections might have established a 12 @-@ year monopoly on the data that US pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies compile on new drugs ( particularly biologics ) , thereby impeding competition from lower @-@ cost generic versions .
in the end , these companies did not get all they wanted ; while the TPP in some ways gives their intellectual property more protection than they had before , it assures protection of their data for only 5 @-@ 8 years .
the focus on new areas of deep integration should not obscure the old @-@ fashioned free @-@ trade benefits that are also part of the TPP : reducing thousands of existing tariff and non @-@ tariff barriers .
liberalization will affect manufacturing sectors such as the automotive industry , as well as services , including the Internet .
liberalization of agriculture - long a stubborn holdout in international trade negotiations - is noteworthy .
countries like Japan have agreed to let in more dairy products , sugar , beef , and rice from more efficient producers in countries like New Zealand and Australia .
in all these areas and more , traditional textbook arguments about the gains from trade apply : new export opportunities lead to higher wages and a lower cost of living .
many citizens and politicians made up their minds about TPP long ago , based on seemingly devastating critiques of what might emerge from the negotiations .
they should now look at the outcome with an open mind .
they just might find that their worst nighttime fears have vanished by the light of day .
Europe &apos;s Non @-@ Deal of the Century
Brussels - As Europe picks over the ruins of the mega @-@ merger that would have created a world @-@ beating new aerospace and defense giant , questions are being asked about the inglorious role that the European Union played in the fiasco .
the European Commission &apos;s failure to champion the $ 50 billion merger of the Franco @-@ German European aeronautic Defence and Space Company ( EADS ) , owner of Airbus , and the United Kingdom &apos;s BAE Systems is being seen as a crucial factor in the deal &apos;s collapse .
the integration of the two high @-@ tech aviation and avionics leaders had looked like an EU @-@ inspired blueprint for industrial success .
for several years , EU leaders have been urging the consolidation of Europe &apos;s defense industries , so the proposed deal - which originated in the corporate boardrooms of EADS and BAE Systems - looked like an answer to their calls .
yet both the Commission and the European Parliament kept silent and withheld the political support that might have ensured that the deal went through .
a timely reminder by EU leaders of the strategic importance of the aerospace sector would have helped allay many of the misgivings in Berlin , and to a lesser degree in London , that ultimately sank the deal .
aviation , like defense , is the sharpest of the R &amp; D cutting edges available to advanced countries , and regularly produces key technological breakthroughs .
nationalist squabbles over the details of the merger would surely have been attenuated by a statesmanlike intervention from the Commission in Brussels .
it was therefore a bizarre coincidence that the merger &apos;s collapse came on the day that the Commission unveiled its new industrial strategy for regaining Europe &apos;s competitive edge in the face of Asian and North American competition .
one of the most powerful arguments for the EADS @-@ BAE marriage had been the expectation of industry analysts that within 20 years China will challenge Airbus and Boeing in the global aviation market , while also creating a powerful new defense industry .
that scenario now looks all the more likely .
why , then , did the European Commission remain silent ?
the answer appears to be that it feared negative reactions from the three governments involved in the merger talks , and believed that its own authority would suffer from any public rebuff .
the persistent rumor circulating among defense company executives is that soon after news of the proposed merger leaked , the weekly commissioners &quot; meeting chaired by Commission President José Manuel Barroso was enjoined to keep silent on the matter in order to avoid any potential dangers .
whether true or not , the important point is that the merger transcended national considerations , and the European Commission had a duty to involve itself .
the EU &apos;s executive body is meant to be the driving force behind Europe &apos;s efforts to revive laggard industries and fight to reverse the long @-@ term economic decline that the eurozone crisis appears to presage .
nobody is arguing that the Commission is responsible for the deal &apos;s unhappy end - only that it should have rallied support for it .
the significance of the merger &apos;s collapse is now becoming clear to observers across Europe , especially in Germany , where the media have been extremely critical of how &quot; negative politics &quot; sealed the proposed merger &apos;s fate .
with the EU in the throes of the seemingly endless eurozone sovereign @-@ debt crisis and facing a looming debate over its future decision @-@ making architecture , the collapse of the EADS @-@ BAE merger will be no more than a footnote in the history books .
but it may be said to mark the point when the European Commission openly acknowledged that it has become little more than a secretariat to EU governments .
that is a far cry from the political powerhouse that some Europeans fear - and for which others still hope .
should Central Banks Target Employment ?
Washington , DC - On December 12 , US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced that the Fed will keep interest rates at close to zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 % , provided inflation expectations remain subdued .
while the Fed &apos;s governing statutes , unlike those of the European Central Bank , explicitly include a mandate to support employment , the announcement marked the first time that the Fed tied its interest @-@ rate policy to a numerical employment target .
it is a welcome breakthrough , and one that should be emulated by others - not least the ECB .
central banks &quot; statutes differ in terms of the objectives that they set for monetary policy .
all include price stability .
many add a reference to general economic conditions , including growth and employment or financial stability .
some give the central bank the authority to set an inflation target unilaterally ; others stipulate coordination with the government in setting the target .
there is no recent example , however , of a major central bank setting a numerical employment target .
this should change , as the size of the employment challenge facing the advanced economies becomes more apparent .
weak labor markets , low inflation , and debt overhang suggest that a fundamental re @-@ ordering of priorities is in order .
in Japan , Shinzo Abe , the incoming prime minister , is signaling the same set of concerns , although he seems to be proposing a &quot; minimum &quot; inflation target for the Bank of Japan , rather than a link to growth or employment .
the spread of global value @-@ chains that integrate hundreds of millions of developing @-@ country workers into the global economy , as well as new labor @-@ saving technologies , imply little chance of cost @-@ push wage inflation .
likewise , the market for long @-@ term bonds indicates extremely low inflation expectations ( of course , interest rates are higher in cases of perceived sovereign default or re @-@ denomination risk , such as in Southern Europe , but that has nothing to do with inflation ) .
moreover , the deleveraging underway since the 2008 financial implosion could be easier if inflation were moderately higher for a few years , a debate the International Monetary Fund encouraged a year ago .
together with these considerations , policymakers should take into account the tremendous human and economic costs of high unemployment , ranging from the millions of shattered lives , skills erosion , and disappearance of opportunities for an entire generation , to the dead @-@ weight loss of idle human resources .
is the failure to ensure that millions of young people acquire the skills required to participate in the economy not as great a liability for a society as a large stock of public debt ?
nowhere is this reordering of priorities more needed than in the eurozone .
yet , strangely , it is the Fed , not the ECB , that has set an unemployment target .
the US unemployment rate has declined to around 7.7 % and the current @-@ account deficit is close to $ 500 billion , while eurozone unemployment is at a record high , near 12 % , and the current account shows a surplus approaching $ 100 billion .
if the ECB &apos;s inflation target were 3 % , rather than close to but below 2 % , and Germany , with the world &apos;s largest current @-@ account surplus , encouraged 6 % wage growth and tolerated 4 % inflation - implying modest real @-@ wage growth in excess of expected productivity gains - the eurozone adjustment process would become less politically and economically costly .
indeed , the policy calculus in Northern Europe greatly underestimates the economic losses due to the disruptions imposed on the South by excessive austerity and wage deflation .
the resulting high levels of youth unemployment , health problems , and idle production capacity also all have a substantial impact on demand for imports from the North .
contrary to conventional wisdom , the ECB &apos;s legal mandate would allow such a re @-@ ordering of priorities , as , with reference to the ECB , the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that &quot; The primary ( emphasis added ) objective of the European System of Central Banks ... shall be to maintain price stability , &quot; and there is another part of the Treaty dealing with general eurozone economic policies that emphasizes employment .
this would seem not to preclude a temporary complementary employment objective for the ECB at a time of exceptional challenge .
moreover , the ECB has the authority to set the eurozone @-@ wide inflation target , and could set it higher for two or three years , without any treaty violation .
the real problem is the current political attitude in Germany .
somehow , the memory of hyperinflation in the early 1920 &quot; s seems scarier than that of massive unemployment in the early 1930 &quot; s , although it was the latter that fueled the rise of Nazism .
maybe the upcoming German elections will allow progressive forces to clarify what is at stake for Germany and Europe - indeed , the entire world .
in a more global context , none of this is to dismiss the longer @-@ term dangers of inflation .
in most countries , at most times , inflation should be kept very low - and central banks should anchor inflation expectations with a stable long @-@ term target , although the alternative of targeting nominal GDP deserves to be discussed .
moreover , monetary policy cannot be a long @-@ term substitute for structural reforms and sustainable budgets .
long periods of zero real interest rates carry the danger of asset bubbles , misallocation of resources , and unintended effects on income inequality , as recent history - not least in the US and Japan - demonstrates .
for the coming 2 @-@ 3 years , however , particularly in Europe , the need for deleveraging , the costs of widespread joblessness , and the risk of social collapse make the kind of temporary unemployment target announced by the Fed highly desirable .
Mario Draghi &apos;s opiate of the Markets
Chicago - From the standpoint of European stability , the Italian elections could not have delivered a worse outcome .
Italy &apos;s parliament is divided among three mutually incompatible political forces , with none strong enough to rule alone .
worse , one of these forces , which won 25 % of the vote , is an anti @-@ euro populist party , while another , a Euro @-@ skeptic group led by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , received close to 30 % support , giving anti @-@ euro parties a clear majority .
despite these scary results , the interest @-@ rate spread for Italian government bonds relative to German bunds has increased by only 40 basis points since the election .
in July 2012 , when a pro @-@ European , austerity @-@ minded government was running the country , with the well @-@ respected economist Mario Monti in charge , the spread reached 536 basis points .
today , with no government and little chance that a decent one will be formed soon , the spread sits at 314 points .
so , are markets bullish about Italy , or have they lost their ability to assess risk ?
a recent survey of international investors conducted by Morgan Stanley suggests that they are not bullish .
Forty @-@ six percent of the respondents said that the most likely outcome for Italy is an interim administration and new elections .
and they regard this outcome as the worst @-@ case scenario , one that implies a delay of any further economic measures , deep policy uncertainty , and the risk of an even less favorable electoral outcome .
the survey also clearly indicated why the interest @-@ rate spread for Italian government bonds is not much wider : the perceived backstop provided by the European Central Bank .
although investors believe that the backstop is unlikely to be used , its mere presence dissuades them from betting against Italy .
in other words , the &quot; outright monetary transactions &quot; ( OMT ) scheme announced by ECB President Mario Draghi last July has served as the proverbial &quot; bazooka &quot; - a gun so powerful that it does not need to be used .
then @-@ US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sought a bazooka during the 2008 financial crisis .
he failed , because he believed that even a fake gun would work if it looked scary enough .
not falling for the trick , speculators repeatedly called his bluff .
Draghi , with his famous pledge to do &quot; whatever it takes &quot; to ensure the euro &apos;s survival , succeeded where Paulson did not .
after all , he controls the monetary spigot .
but even Draghi &apos;s bazooka is partly a bluff .
Draghi designed it to relieve the ECB of the huge political responsibility of deciding when to save a country from default .
for this reason , triggering the OMT mechanism requires the unanimous consent of eurozone governments .
but , if the bazooka is needed , how likely is it to be fired before the German election in September ?
the Morgan Stanley survey did not ask this question , probably because everybody knows the answer : not likely at all .
thus , markets remain calm because they expect the bazooka not to be needed .
in that case , the fact that it cannot be triggered easily does not pose a significant problem .
its presence is enough to support a benign self @-@ fulfilling prophecy .
in other words , Draghi &apos;s bazooka has anesthetized markets , impairing their ability to assess risk .
but as with all anesthetics , Draghi &apos;s cannot and will not last forever .
either the underlying problem is fixed before the patient wakes up , or the pain will be devastating .
the investors surveyed by Morgan Stanley put the chance of a renewed crisis in Italy below 25 % .
I believe that it is higher than 50 % .
even after Germany &apos;s election , I am not sure that the government will be willing to support an Italian rescue program without asking for major guarantees concerning the objectives - and even the composition - of Italy &apos;s ruling coalition .
indeed , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will face a serious dilemma following her likely re @-@ election .
without strict conditionality , she would risk shifting the domestic consensus in favor of Germany &apos;s emerging Euro @-@ skeptic mood .
but , by insisting on such conditionality , she would trigger a huge political crisis in Europe . if the German government gets to decide who governs Italy , why should Italians bother voting ?
the eurozone will look like a German protectorate , rather than a voluntary union of sovereign countries .
the political backlash would be enormous .
the only hope is that the eurozone makes strong progress toward establishing fiscal @-@ redistribution mechanisms , such as European unemployment insurance , before Draghi &apos;s anesthetic wears off .
otherwise , Europe will face a very rude awakening indeed .
China &apos;s American Bailout ?
Zurich - The twenty @-@ first @-@ century economy has thus far been shaped by capital flows from China to the United States - a pattern that has suppressed global interest rates , helped to reflate the developed world &apos;s leverage bubble , and , through its impact on the currency market , fueled China &apos;s meteoric rise .
but these were no ordinary capital flows .
rather than being driven by direct or portfolio investment , they came primarily from the People &apos;s Bank of China ( PBOC ) , as it amassed $ 3.5 trillion in foreign reserves - largely US Treasury securities .
the fact that a single institution wields so much influence over global macroeconomic trends has caused considerable anxiety , with doomsayers predicting that doubts about US debt sustainability will force China to sell off its holdings of US debt .
this would drive up interest rates in the US and , ultimately , could trigger the dollar &apos;s collapse .
but selling off US Treasury securities , it was argued , was not in China &apos;s interest , given that it would drive up the renminbi &apos;s exchange rate against the dollar , diminishing the domestic value of China &apos;s reserves and undermining the export sector &apos;s competitiveness .
indeed , a US defense department report last year on the national @-@ security implications of China &apos;s holdings of US debt concluded that &quot; attempting to use US Treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to China than to the &#91; US &#93; . &quot;
to describe the symbiotic relationship between China &apos;s export @-@ led GDP growth and America &apos;s excessive consumption , the economic historians Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick coined the term &quot; Chimerica . &quot;
the invocation of the chimera of Greek mythology - a monstrous , fire @-@ breathing amalgam of lion , goat , and dragon - makes the term all the more appropriate , given that Chimerica has generated massive and terrifying distortions in the global economy that cannot be corrected without serious consequences .
in 2009 , these distortions led Ferguson and Schularick to forecast Chimerica &apos;s collapse - a prediction that seems to be coming true .
with the reserves &quot; long @-@ term effects on China &apos;s internal economic dynamics finally taking hold , selling off foreign @-@ exchange reserves is now in China &apos;s interest .
over the last decade , the vast quantities of short @-@ term capital that were being pumped into China &apos;s banking system drove commercial banks and other financial institutions to expand credit substantially , especially through the shadow @-@ banking system , leading to a massive credit bubble and severe over @-@ investment .
in order to manage the resulting increase in risk , China &apos;s new leaders are now refusing to provide further liquidity injections , as well as curbing loans to unprofitable sectors .
but these efforts could trigger a financial crisis , requiring China to initiate a major recapitalization of the banking system .
in such a scenario , non @-@ performing loans in China &apos;s banking system would probably amount to roughly $ 1 trillion .
the most obvious means of recapitalizing China &apos;s banks would be to inject renminbi @-@ denominated government debt into the banking sector .
but China &apos;s total public debt , including off @-@ balance @-@ sheet local @-@ government financing vehicles , probably amounts to around 70 % of GDP already .
despite debate over the details , the conclusion of Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff - that a high debt / GDP ratio can inhibit economic growth - remains widely accepted ; so it is unlikely that raising the debt ratio to 100 % would be in China &apos;s long @-@ term interest .
even if China &apos;s leaders decided that they had the necessary fiscal latitude to pursue such a strategy , they probably would not , owing to the risk of inflation , which , perhaps more than any other economic variable , tends to lead to social unrest .
given this , in the event of a crisis , China would most likely have to begin selling off its massive store of US debt .
fortunately for China , the negative consequences of such a move would probably be far less severe than previously thought .
to be sure , an injection of US Treasuries into the banking sector , and their subsequent conversion to renminbi , would still strengthen China &apos;s currency .
but the rise would most likely be offset by capital outflows , as looser capital controls would enable savers to escape the financial crisis .
moreover , even if the renminbi became stronger in the short term , China is no longer as dependent on maintaining export competitiveness as it once was , given that , excluding assembly and reprocessing , exports now contribute less than 5 % of China &apos;s GDP .
against this background , the US Federal Reserve , rather than focusing only on &quot; tapering &quot; its monthly purchases of long @-@ term securities ( quantitative easing ) , must prepare itself for a potential sell @-@ off of US debt .
given that a Fed @-@ funded recapitalization of China &apos;s banking system would negate the impact of monetary policy at home , driving up borrowing costs and impeding GDP growth , the Fed should be ready to sustain quantitative easing in the event of a Chinese financial crisis .
after spending years attempting to insulate the US economy from the upshot of its own banking crisis , the Fed may ultimately be forced to bail out China &apos;s banks , too .
this would fundamentally redefine - and , one hopes , rebalance - US @-@ China relations .
why the Fed Should postpone Rate Hikes
Jackson hole , Wyoming - As central bankers from around the world gather this week in Jackson Hole for the Federal Reserve &apos;s annual Economic Policy Symposium , one key topic of discussion will be the current global stock @-@ market turmoil .
there are many reasons for these gyrations , but the expectation that the Fed will start to raise interest rates - perhaps as early as September - is clearly one of them .
the arguments for a rate hike are valid .
the United States &quot; economy is gaining traction .
the International Monetary Fund forecasts 3 % annual growth in 2015 and 2016 , accompanied by inflation rates of 0.1 % and 1.5 % , respectively .
when an economy is normalizing , it is reasonable to reduce expansionary measures , such as those introduced after the crisis of 2008 .
because the Fed has clearly communicated that it will move gradually toward less expansionary policies , its credibility would be damaged if it did not follow through .
but there are strong reasons for the Fed to postpone interest @-@ rate hikes and to keep monetary policy expansionary over the coming quarters .
for starters , the US recovery remains weak .
historically , 3 % growth during a recovery is far from impressive .
in other recent recoveries , growth often hit 4 % or even 5 % when increased capacity utilization pushed up productivity and investment .
over the past three decades , the US has been able to grow at an average annual rate of around 2.5 % .
some attribute relatively slow growth to demographic factors , which have reduced the labor force , as well as to weak productivity levels , which have been low .
but America &apos;s potential output may be underestimated , and its inflation propensity exaggerated .
the US labor market works well .
unemployment is down to 5 % , with no signs of overheating .
the employment cost index suggests that wage increases so far have been surprisingly low .
one reason for this is that labor @-@ market flexibility increased during the recovery .
self @-@ employment , short @-@ term contracts , or part @-@ time arrangements account for many of the jobs that have been created over the past few years .
full @-@ time jobs with comprehensive benefits are now much rarer .
this ongoing &quot; Uberization &quot; of the US labor market means that the balance in the wage @-@ setting process has shifted .
as a result , it will take longer for demand to feed through to wages and inflation than in the past .
moreover , the economy is undergoing an ongoing technological shift stemming from digitization and globalization .
estimates from Citigroup indicate that almost half of all jobs will be disrupted in the coming decades .
jobs that require lower skills and less training are particularly vulnerable ; but it is also clear that many other occupational categories - including administration , accounting , logistics , banking , and various service activities - are likely to be affected .
companies will be able to reduce their headcount and production costs while improving customer service , which , like Uberization , will affect the wage @-@ setting process .
central bankers , I believe , are underestimating the impact of this structural shift .
in the more tech @-@ oriented economies , like the US , the United Kingdom , and the Nordic countries , there is a risk that traditional macroeconomic models will overestimate the cost pressure from labor .
another reason why the Fed should postpone a rate hike is that financial turmoil in emerging markets , particularly China , could have a substantial impact on the global economy , with some clear implications for the US economy .
in particular , lower energy and commodity prices are likely to dampen inflationary pressure .
when inflation is low for a long period , inflation expectations also tend to be low .
add falling commodity and energy prices to the mix and there is a risk that inflation expectations will remain too low to sustain a balanced recovery .
the global implications of lower emerging @-@ market currencies are also likely to be deflationary .
the direct impact is that a stronger dollar reduces the cost of imported goods .
the indirect effect , which might be substantial , is that cost @-@ competitive light manufacturing in emerging markets increases .
that would reinforce the deflationary pressure from globalization for years to come .
there is also a risk of greater currency @-@ market volatility if the Fed jumps the gun in raising rates .
the Fed &apos;s unconventional monetary policies have been necessary for the US .
but , because they flooded global markets with liquidity , large portfolio flows have moved into emerging @-@ market countries , whose currencies often are not as liquid as the dollar .
when investment moves back into dollars , the currency fluctuations in these less liquid markets can become excessive .
the Fed clearly has a responsibility to consider how its policy decisions affect the global financial system .
excessive currency volatility is not in America &apos;s interest , not least because large exchange @-@ rate depreciations in emerging markets would amplify the effects of globalization on US jobs , wages , and inflation , particularly as weaker foreign currencies make outsourcing a more economically viable solution .
another reason for the Fed to reconsider hiking rates is that the legitimacy of the Bretton Woods institutions depends on a well @-@ functioning global financial system .
